\mt1 THE FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
\v 2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
\p
\v 3  Blessed \add be\add* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto
a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
\v 4  To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not
away, reserved in heaven for you, 
\v 5  Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
ready to be revealed in the last time. 
\v 6  Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
\v 7  That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than
of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found
unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
\v 8  Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see \add him\add*
not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
\v 9  Receiving the end of your faith, \add even\add* the salvation
of \add your\add* souls. 
\v 10  Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the grace \add that should come\add*
unto you: 
\v 11  Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings
of Christ, and the glory that should follow. 
\v 12  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you
by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost
sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
\v 13  Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation
of Jesus Christ; 
\v 14  As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according
to the former lusts in your ignorance: 
\v 15  But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in
all manner of conversation; 
\v 16  Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
\v 17  And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning
\add here\add* in fear: 
\v 18  Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
things, \add as\add* silver and gold, from your vain conversation
\add received\add* by tradition from your fathers; 
\v 19  But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
blemish and without spot: 
\v 20  Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,
but was manifest in these last times for you, 
\v 21  Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
\v 22  Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, \add see that ye\add*
love one another with a pure heart fervently: 
\v 23  Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
\v 24  For all flesh \add is\add* as grass, and all the glory of
man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
falleth away: 
\v 25  But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
word which by the gospel is preached unto you. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, and all evil speakings, 
\v 2  As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that
ye may grow thereby: 
\v 3  If so be ye have tasted that the Lord \add is\add* gracious.
\v 4  To whom coming, \add as unto\add* a living stone, disallowed
indeed of men, but chosen of God, \add and\add* precious, 
\v 5  Ye also, as lively  stones, are built up a spiritual house,
an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
to God by Jesus Christ. 
\v 6  Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I
lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth
on him shall not be confounded. 
\v 7  Unto you therefore which believe \add he is\add* precious:
but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders
disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, 
\v 8  And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, \add even to
them\add* which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto
also they were appointed. 
\v 9  But ye \add are\add* a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous
light: 
\v 10  Which in time past \add were\add* not a people, but \add are\add*
now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
mercy. 
\p
\v 11  Dearly beloved, I beseech \add you\add* as strangers and pilgrims,
abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
\v 12  Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by \add your\add*
good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
\p
\v 13  Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s
sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
\v 14  Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
\v 15  For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
\v 16  As free, and not using \add your\add* liberty for a cloke
of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 
\v 17  Honour all \add men\add*. Love the brotherhood. Fear God.
Honour the king. 
\v 18  Servants, \add be\add* subject to \add your\add* masters with
all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
\v 19  For this \add is\add* thankworthy, if a man for conscience
toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. 
\v 20  For what glory \add is it\add*, if, when ye be buffeted for your
faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
suffer \add for it\add*, ye take it patiently, this \add is\add*
acceptable with God. 
\v 21  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
\v 22  Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
\v 23  Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
he threatened not; but committed \add himself\add* to him that judgeth
righteously: 
\v 24  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose
stripes ye were healed. 
\v 25  For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Likewise, ye wives, \add be\add* in subjection to your own
husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the
word be won by the conversation of the wives; 
\v 2  While they behold your chaste conversation \add coupled\add*
with fear. 
\v 3  Whose adorning let it not be that outward \add adorning\add*
of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of
apparel; 
\v 4  But \add let it be\add* the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
corruptible, \add even the ornament\add* of a meek and quiet spirit,
which is in the sight of God of great price. 
\v 5  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also,
who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their
own husbands: 
\v 6  Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters
ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
\v 7  Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with \add them\add* according
to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel,
and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers
be not hindered. 
\v 8  Finally, \add be ye\add* all of one mind, having compassion one of
another, love as brethren, \add be\add* pitiful, \add be\add* courteous:
\v 9  Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise
blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit
a blessing. 
\v 10  For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 
\v 11  Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
ensue it. 
\v 12  For the eyes of the Lord \add are\add* over the righteous,
and his ears \add are open\add* unto their prayers: but the face
of the Lord \add is\add* against them that do evil. 
\p
\v 13  And who \add is\add* he that will harm you, if ye be followers
of that which is good? 
\v 14  But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy \add are
ye\add*: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
\v 15  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and \add be\add*
ready always to \add give\add* an answer to every man that asketh
you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: 
\v 16  Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your
good conversation in Christ. 
\v 17  For \add it is\add* better, if the will of God be so, that ye
suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. 
\v 18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for
the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 
\v 19  By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
\v 20  Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. 
\v 21  The like figure whereunto \add even\add* baptism doth also
now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection
of Jesus Christ: 
\v 22  Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered
in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
\v 2  That he no longer should live the rest of \add his\add* time
in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 
\v 3  For the time past of \add our\add* life may suffice us to have
wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
\v 4  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with \add them\add*
to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of \add you\add*: 
\v 5  Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
and the dead. 
\v 6  For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but
live according to God in the spirit. 
\p
\v 7  But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
and watch unto prayer. 
\v 8  And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. 
\v 9  Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
\v 10  As every man hath received the gift, \add even so\add* minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God. 
\v 11  If any man speak, \add let him speak\add* as the oracles of
God; if any man minister, \add let him do it\add* as of the ability
which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through
Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 12  Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 
\v 13  But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings;
that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy. 
\v 14  If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy \add are
ye\add*; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on
their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
\v 15  But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or \add as\add*
a thief, or \add as\add* an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s
matters. 
\v 16  Yet if \add any man suffer\add* as a Christian, let him not
be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 
\v 17  For the time \add is come\add* that judgment must begin at
the house of God: and if \add it\add* first \add begin\add* at us,
what shall the end \add be\add* of them that obey not the gospel
of God? 
\v 18  And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly
and the sinner appear? 
\v 19  Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
commit the keeping of their souls \add to him\add* in well doing,
as unto a faithful Creator. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed: 
\v 2  Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
\add thereof\add*, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
lucre, but of a ready mind; 
\v 3  Neither as being lords over \add God’s\add* heritage, but being
ensamples to the flock. 
\v 4  And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive
a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 
\v 5  Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
all \add of you\add* be subject one to another, and be clothed with
humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
\p
\v 6  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
he may exalt you in due time: 
\v 7  Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
\v 8  Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
\v 9  Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
\v 10  But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make
you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle \add you\add*. 
\v 11  To him \add be\add* glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen. 
\p
\v 12  By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true
grace of God wherein ye stand. 
\v 13  The \add church that is\add* at Babylon, elected together
with \add you\add*, saluteth you; and \add so doth\add* Marcus my
son. 
\v 14  Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace \add be\add*
with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
