\v 1  The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 
\v 2  To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
\v 3  To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
and equity;\f + \fr 1.3  \ft equity: Heb. equities\f* 
\v 4  To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge
and discretion.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft discretion: or, advisement\f* 
\v 5  A wise \add man\add* will hear, and will increase learning;
and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 
\v 6  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words
of the wise, and their dark sayings.\f + \fr 1.6  \ft the interpretation: or, an eloquent
speech\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ The fear of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* the beginning of
knowledge: \add but\add* fools despise wisdom and instruction.\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft the beginning: or, the principal part\f* 
\v 8  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the
law of thy mother: 
\v 9 For they \add shall be\add* an ornament of grace unto thy head,
and chains about thy neck.\f + \fr 1.9  \ft an…: Heb. an adding\f*
\p
\v 10 ¶ My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 
\v 11  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 
\v 12  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go
down into the pit: 
\v 13  We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
with spoil: 
\v 14  Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 
\v 15  My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
from their path: 
\v 16  For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
\v 17  Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft in the…: Heb. in the eyes of every thing that hath a wing\f*
\v 18  And they lay wait for their \add own\add* blood; they lurk
privily for their \add own\add* lives. 
\v 19 So \add are\add* the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
\add which\add* taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:\f + \fr 1.20 
\ft Wisdom: Heb. Wisdoms, that is, Excellent wisdom\f* 
\v 21  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings
of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, \add saying\add*,
\v 22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
\v 23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit
unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out
my hand, and no man regarded; 
\v 25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
reproof: 
\v 26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
fear cometh; 
\v 27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh  upon you.
\v 28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me
early, but they shall not find me: 
\v 29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear
of the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
\v 31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
filled with their own devices. 
\v 32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them.\f + \fr 1.32  \ft turning…: or, ease of the
simple\f* 
\v 33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
quiet from fear of evil. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
\v 2  So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, \add and\add* apply
thine heart to understanding; 
\v 3  Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, \add and\add* liftest
up thy voice for understanding;\f + \fr 2.3  \ft liftest…: Heb. givest thy
voice\f* 
\v 4  If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as \add for\add*
hid treasures; 
\v 5  Then shalt thou understand the fear of the \nd LORD\nd*, and
find the knowledge of God. 
\v 6  For the \nd LORD\nd* giveth wisdom: out of his mouth \add cometh\add*
knowledge and understanding. 
\v 7  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: \add he is\add*
a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 
\v 8  He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his
saints. 
\v 9  Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
equity; \add yea\add*, every good path. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul; 
\v 11  Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
\v 12  To deliver thee from the way of the evil \add man\add*, from the
man that speaketh froward things; 
\v 13  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
darkness; 
\v 14  Who rejoice to do evil, \add and\add* delight in the frowardness
of the wicked; 
\v 15  Whose ways \add are\add* crooked, and \add they\add* froward
 in their paths: 
\v 16  To deliver thee from the strange woman, \add even\add* from the
stranger \add which\add* flattereth with her words; 
\v 17  Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
covenant of her God. 
\v 18  For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
dead. 
\v 19  None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold
of the paths of life. 
\v 20  That thou mayest walk in the way of good \add men\add*, and
keep the paths of the righteous. 
\v 21  For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
remain in it. 
\v 22  But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors
shall be rooted out of it.\f + \fr 2.22  \ft rooted: or, plucked
up\f* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
\v 2  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to
thee.\f + \fr 3.2  \ft long…: Heb. years of life\f* 
\v 3  Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;
write them upon the table of thine heart: 
\v 4  So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
of God and man.\f + \fr 3.4  \ft good…: or, good success\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Trust in the \nd LORD\nd* with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding. 
\v 6  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the \nd LORD\nd*, and
depart from evil. 
\v 8  It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.\f + \fr 3.8 
\ft health: Heb. medicine\f*\f + \fr 3.8  \ft marrow: Heb. watering, or,
moistening\f* 
\v 9  Honour the \nd LORD\nd* with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
of all thine increase: 
\v 10  So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
shall burst out with new wine. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ My son, despise not the chastening of the \nd LORD\nd*; neither be
weary of his correction: 
\v 12  For whom the \nd LORD\nd* loveth he correcteth; even as a
father the son \add in whom\add* he delighteth. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Happy \add is\add* the man \add that\add* findeth wisdom,
and the man \add that\add* getteth understanding.\f + \fr 3.13  \ft that getteth…: Heb. that draweth out
understanding\f* 
\v 14  For the merchandise of it \add is\add* better than the merchandise
of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 
\v 15 She \add is\add* more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst
desire are not to be compared unto her. 
\v 16  Length of days \add is\add* in her right hand; \add and\add*
in her left hand riches and honour. 
\v 17  Her ways \add are\add* ways of pleasantness, and all her paths
\add are\add* peace. 
\v 18 She \add is\add* a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
happy \add is every one\add* that retaineth her. 
\v 19  The \nd LORD\nd* by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
hath he established the heavens.\f + \fr 3.19  \ft established: or,
prepared\f* 
\v 20  By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds
drop down the dew. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
and discretion: 
\v 22  So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
\v 23  Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
stumble. 
\v 24  When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 
\v 25  Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
wicked, when it cometh. 
\v 26  For the \nd LORD\nd* shall be thy confidence, and shall keep
thy foot from being taken. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thine hand to do \add it\add*.\f + \fr 3.27  \ft them…: Heb. the owners
thereof\f* 
\v 28  Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
I will give; when thou hast it by thee. 
\v 29  Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
securely by thee.\f + \fr 3.29  \ft Devise…: or, Practise no evil\f*
\p
\v 30 ¶ Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
harm. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.\f + \fr 3.31 
\ft the oppressor: Heb. a man of violence\f* 
\v 32  For the froward \add is\add* abomination to the \nd LORD\nd*:
but his secret \add is\add* with the righteous. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ The curse of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* in the house of the
wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. 
\v 34  Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
lowly. 
\v 35  The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
of fools.\f + \fr 3.35  \ft shall be…: Heb. exalteth the fools\f*
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend
to know understanding. 
\v 2  For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
\v 3  For I was my father’s son, tender and only \add beloved\add*
in the sight of my mother. 
\v 4  He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain
my words: keep my commandments, and live. 
\v 5  Get wisdom, get understanding: forget \add it\add* not; neither
decline from the words of my mouth. 
\v 6  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall
keep thee. 
\v 7  Wisdom \add is\add* the principal thing; \add therefore\add*
get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 
\v 8  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
honour, when thou dost embrace her. 
\v 9  She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown
of glory shall she deliver to thee.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft a crown…: or, she shall compass thee with a crown of
glory\f* 
\v 10  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
life shall be many. 
\v 11  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
right paths. 
\v 12  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 
\v 13  Take fast hold of instruction; let \add her\add* not go: keep her; for she
\add is\add* thy life. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the
way of evil \add men\add*. 
\v 15  Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. 
\v 16  For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
sleep is taken away, unless they cause \add some\add* to fall. 
\v 17  For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
violence. 
\v 18  But the path of the just \add is\add* as the shining light,
that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 
\v 19  The way of the wicked \add is\add* as darkness: they know
not at what they stumble. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
\v 21  Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst
of thine heart. 
\v 22 For they \add are\add* life unto those that find them, and
health to all their flesh.\f + \fr 4.22  \ft health: Heb. medicine\f*
\p
\v 23 ¶ Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it \add are\add*
the issues of life.\f + \fr 4.23  \ft with…: Heb. above all keeping\f*
\v 24  Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put
far from thee.\f + \fr 4.24  \ft a froward…: Heb. frowardness of mouth and perverseness of
lips\f* 
\v 25  Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
\v 26  Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.\f + \fr 4.26 
\ft let…: or, all thy ways shall be ordered aright\f* 
\v 27  Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
from evil. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  My son, attend unto my wisdom, \add and\add* bow thine ear
to my understanding: 
\v 2  That thou mayest regard discretion, and \add that\add* thy
lips may keep knowledge. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ For the lips of a strange woman drop \add as\add* an honeycomb,
and her mouth \add is\add* smoother than oil:\f + \fr 5.3  \ft mouth: Heb.
palate\f* 
\v 4  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
\v 5  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 
\v 6  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable,
\add that\add* thou canst not know \add them\add*. 
\v 7  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
words of my mouth. 
\v 8  Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
house: 
\v 9  Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the
cruel: 
\v 10  Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours
\add be\add* in the house of a stranger;\f + \fr 5.10  \ft thy wealth: Heb. thy
strength\f* 
\v 11  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
consumed, 
\v 12  And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
reproof; 
\v 13  And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
mine ear to them that instructed me! 
\v 14  I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation
and assembly. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters
out of thine own well. 
\v 16  Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, \add and\add* rivers
of waters in the streets. 
\v 17  Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.
\v 18  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
youth. 
\v 19  \add Let her be as\add* the loving hind and pleasant roe;
let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
with her love.\f + \fr 5.19  \ft satisfy…: Heb. water thee\f*\f + \fr 5.19 
\ft be thou…: Heb. err thou always in her love\f* 
\v 20  And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
\v 21  For the ways of man \add are\add* before the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and he pondereth all his goings. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be
holden with the cords of his sins.\f + \fr 5.22  \ft sins: Heb. sin\f*
\v 23  He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
folly he shall go astray. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, \add if\add* thou hast
stricken thy hand with a stranger, 
\v 2  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
with the words of thy mouth. 
\v 3  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy
friend.\f + \fr 6.3  \ft and make…: or, so shalt thou prevail with thy
friend\f* 
\v 4  Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
\v 5  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand \add of the hunter\add*,
and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
\v 7  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 
\v 8  Provideth her meat in the summer, \add and\add* gathereth her
food in the harvest. 
\v 9  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise
out of thy sleep? 
\v 10  \add Yet\add* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding
of the hands to sleep: 
\v 11  So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy
want as an armed man. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
\v 13  He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth
with his fingers; 
\v 14  Frowardness \add is\add* in his heart, he deviseth mischief
continually; he soweth discord.\f + \fr 6.14  \ft soweth: Heb. casteth
forth\f* 
\v 15  Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be
broken without remedy. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ These six \add things\add* doth the \nd LORD\nd* hate: yea,
seven \add are\add* an abomination unto him:\f + \fr 6.16  \ft unto…: Heb. of his
soul\f* 
\v 17  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
blood,\f + \fr 6.17  \ft A proud…: Heb. Haughty eyes\f* 
\v 18  An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
in running to mischief, 
\v 19  A false witness \add that\add* speaketh lies, and he that
soweth discord among brethren. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the
law of thy mother: 
\v 21  Bind them continually upon thine heart, \add and\add* tie
them about thy neck. 
\v 22  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall
keep thee; and \add when\add* thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
\v 23  For the commandment \add is\add* a lamp; and the law \add is\add*
light; and reproofs of instruction \add are\add* the way of life:\f + \fr 6.23 
\ft lamp: or, candle\f* 
\v 24  To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
tongue of a strange woman.\f + \fr 6.24  \ft of the…: or, of the strange
tongue\f* 
\v 25  Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her
take thee with her eyelids. 
\v 26  For by means of a whorish woman \add a man is brought\add*
to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious
life.\f + \fr 6.26  \ft the adulteress: Heb. the woman of a man, or, a man’s
wife\f* 
\v 27  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
\v 28  Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 
\v 29  So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth
her shall not be innocent. 
\v 30  \add Men\add* do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy
his soul when he is hungry; 
\v 31 But \add if\add* he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall
give all the substance of his house. 
\v 32  \add But\add* whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
understanding: he \add that\add* doeth it destroyeth his own soul.\f + \fr 6.32 
\ft understanding: Heb. heart\f* 
\v 33  A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped
away. 
\v 34  For jealousy \add is\add* the rage of a man: therefore he will not
spare in the day of vengeance. 
\v 35  He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
though thou givest many gifts.\f + \fr 6.35  \ft He will…: Heb. He will not accept the face of any
ransom\f* 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
\v 2  Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine
eye. 
\v 3  Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
heart. 
\v 4  Say unto wisdom, Thou \add art\add* my sister; and call understanding
\add thy\add* kinswoman: 
\v 5  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger
\add which\add* flattereth with her words. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
\v 7  And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths,
a young man void of understanding,\f + \fr 7.7  \ft the youths: Heb. the
sons\f* 
\v 8  Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
way to her house, 
\v 9  In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:\f + \fr 7.9 
\ft in the evening: Heb. in the evening of days\f* 
\v 10  And, behold, there met him a woman \add with\add* the attire
of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 
\v 11 (She \add is\add* loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her
house: 
\v 12  Now \add is she\add* without, now in the streets, and lieth in
wait at every corner.) 
\v 13  So she caught him, and kissed him, \add and\add* with an impudent
face said unto him,\f + \fr 7.13  \ft with…: Heb. she strengthened her face and
said\f* 
\v 14  \add I have\add* peace offerings with me; this day have I
payed my vows.\f + \fr 7.14  \ft I have…: Heb. Peace offerings are upon
me\f* 
\v 15  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
face, and I have found thee. 
\v 16  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
\add works\add*, with fine linen of Egypt. 
\v 17  I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
\v 18  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
solace ourselves with loves. 
\v 19  For the goodman \add is\add* not at home, he is gone a long
journey: 
\v 20  He hath taken a bag of money with him, \add and\add* will
come home at the day appointed.\f + \fr 7.20  \ft with…: Heb. in his
hand\f*\f + \fr 7.20  \ft the day…: or, the new moon\f* 
\v 21  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
flattering of her lips she forced him. 
\v 22  He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter,
or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;\f + \fr 7.22  \ft straightway: Heb.
suddenly\f* 
\v 23  Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
snare, and knoweth not that it \add is\add* for his life. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend
to the words of my mouth. 
\v 25  Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
paths. 
\v 26  For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong \add men\add*
have been slain by her. 
\v 27  Her house \add is\add* the way to hell, going down to the
chambers of death. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
\v 2  She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places
of the paths. 
\v 3  She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming
in at the doors. 
\v 4  Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice \add is\add* to the sons
of man. 
\v 5  O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
understanding heart. 
\v 6  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening
of my lips \add shall be\add* right things. 
\v 7  For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness \add is\add*
an abomination to my lips.\f + \fr 8.7  \ft an…: Heb. the abomination of my
lips\f* 
\v 8  All the words of my mouth \add are\add* in righteousness; \add there
is\add* nothing froward or perverse in them.\f + \fr 8.8  \ft froward: Heb.
wreathed\f* 
\v 9 They \add are\add* all plain to him that understandeth, and
right to them that find knowledge. 
\v 10  Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than
choice gold. 
\v 11  For wisdom \add is\add* better than rubies; and all the things that may be
desired are not to be compared to it.
