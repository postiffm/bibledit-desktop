\v 1  In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the
son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
\v 2  The \nd LORD\nd* hath been sore displeased with your fathers.\f + \fr 1.2 
\ft sore…: Heb. with displeasure\f* 
\v 3  Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of
hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, and I will
turn unto you, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\v 4  Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
cried, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; Turn ye now from your
evil ways, and \add from\add* your evil doings: but they did not
hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 5  Your fathers, where \add are\add* they? and the prophets, do they
live for ever? 
\v 6  But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned
and said, Like as the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our
ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.\f + \fr 1.6 
\ft take…: or, overtake\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
\add is\add* the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the
son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
\v 8  I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he
stood among the myrtle trees that \add were\add* in the bottom; and
behind him \add were there\add* red horses, speckled, and white.\f + \fr 1.8 
\ft speckled: or, bay\f* 
\v 9  Then said I, O my lord, what \add are\add* these? And the angel
that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these \add be\add*.
\v 10  And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
said, These \add are they\add* whom the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent to
walk to and fro through the earth. 
\v 11  And they answered the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* that stood
among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* answered and said, O \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and
ten years? 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* answered  the angel that talked with me
\add with\add* good words \add and\add* comfortable words. 
\v 14  So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem
and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
\v 15  And I am very sore displeased with the heathen \add that are\add*
at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the
affliction. 
\v 16  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; I am returned to Jerusalem
with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 
\v 17  Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; My
cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the \nd LORD\nd*
shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft prosperity: Heb. good\f* 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
\v 19  And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What \add be\add*
these? And he answered me, These \add are\add* the horns which have
scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* shewed me four carpenters. 
\v 21  Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These
\add are\add* the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man
did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out
the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up \add their\add* horn over the
land of Judah to scatter it. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a
measuring line in his hand. 
\v 2  Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
Jerusalem, to see what \add is\add* the breadth thereof, and what
\add is\add* the length thereof. 
\v 3  And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
another angel went out to meet him, 
\v 4  And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem
shall be inhabited \add as\add* towns without walls for the multitude
of men and cattle therein: 
\v 5  For I, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, will be unto her a wall of fire
round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Ho, ho, \add come forth\add*, and flee from the land of the
north, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: for I have spread you abroad as the
four winds of the heaven, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 7  Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest \add with\add* the daughter
of Babylon. 
\v 8  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; After the glory hath he
sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth
you toucheth the apple of his eye. 
\v 9  For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a
spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts hath sent me. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will
dwell in the midst of thee, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 11  And many nations shall be joined to the \nd LORD\nd* in that
day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt
know that the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 
\v 12  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall inherit Judah his portion in the
holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 
\v 13  Be silent, O all flesh, before the \nd LORD\nd*: for he is raised
up out of his holy habitation.\f + \fr 2.13  \ft his…: Heb. the habitation of his
holiness\f* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, and Satan standing at his right hand to
resist him.\f + \fr 3.1  \ft Satan: that is, an adversary\f*\f + \fr 3.1 
\ft to…: Heb. to be his adversary\f* 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, The \nd LORD\nd* rebuke
thee, O Satan; even the \nd LORD\nd* that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee:
\add is\add* not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 
\v 3  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
the angel. 
\v 4  And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said,
Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will
clothe thee with change of raiment. 
\v 5  And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the
angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stood by. 
\v 6  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* protested unto Joshua, saying,
\v 7  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my
ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge
my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to
walk among these that stand by.\f + \fr 3.7  \ft charge: or, ordinance\f*\f + \fr 3.7 
\ft places…: Heb. walks\f* 
\p
\v 8  Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
sit before thee: for they \add are\add* men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring
forth my servant the BRANCH.\f + \fr 3.8  \ft wondered…: Heb. of wonder, or,
sign\f* 
\v 9  For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one
stone \add shall be\add* seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
thereof, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity
of that land in one day. 
\v 10  In that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, shall ye call
every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a
man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
\v 2  And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
and behold a candlestick all \add of\add* gold, with a bowl upon the
top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven
lamps, which \add are\add* upon the top thereof:\f + \fr 4.2  \ft a bowl: Heb. her
bowl\f*\f + \fr 4.2  \ft seven pipes…: or, seven several pipes to the
lamps\f* 
\v 3  And two olive trees by it, one upon the right \add side\add*
of the bowl, and the other upon the left \add side\add* thereof.
\v 4  So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What
\add are\add* these, my lord? 
\v 5  Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 6  Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This \add is\add*
the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might,
nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts.\f + \fr 4.6 
\ft might: or, army\f* 
\v 7 Who \add art\add* thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel
\add thou shalt become\add* a plain: and he shall bring forth the
headstone \add thereof with\add* shoutings, \add crying\add*, Grace,
grace unto it. 
\v 8  Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
\v 9  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house;
his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts hath sent me unto you. 
\v 10  For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel \add with\add*
those seven; they \add are\add* the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*, which run to and
fro through the whole earth.\f + \fr 4.10  \ft for they…: or, since the seven eyes of the
\+nd LORD\+nd* shall rejoice\f*\f + \fr 4.10  \ft plummet: Heb. stone of

\p
\v 11 ¶ Then answered I, and said unto him, What \add are\add* these
two olive trees upon the right \add side\add* of the candlestick
and upon the left \add side\add* thereof? 
\v 12  And I answered again, and said unto him, What \add be these\add*
two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden
\add oil\add* out of themselves?\f + \fr 4.12  \ft through: Heb. by the hand
of\f*\f + \fr 4.12  \ft empty…: or, empty out of themselves oil into the

\v 13  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these \add be\add*?
And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 14  Then said he, These \add are\add* the two anointed ones, that
stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\f + \fr 4.14  \ft anointed…: Heb. sons of
oil\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a
flying roll. 
\v 2  And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see
a flying roll; the length thereof \add is\add* twenty cubits, and the
breadth thereof ten cubits. 
\v 3  Then said he unto me, This \add is\add* the curse that goeth
forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth
shall be cut off \add as\add* on this side according to it; and every one that
sweareth shall be cut off \add as\add* on that side according to
it.\f + \fr 5.3  \ft every one that stealeth…: or, every one of this people that stealeth holdeth himself guiltless, as it
doth\f* 
\v 4  I will bring it forth, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, and it shall
enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that
sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his
house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift
up now thine eyes, and see what \add is\add* this that goeth forth.
\v 6  And I said, What \add is\add* it? And he said, This \add is\add*
an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This \add is\add* their
resemblance through all the earth. 
\v 7  And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this
\add is\add* a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.\f + \fr 5.7 
\ft talent: or, weighty piece\f* 
\v 8  And he said, This \add is\add* wickedness. And he cast it into the
midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
\v 9  Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came
out two women, and the wind \add was\add* in their wings; for they
had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah
between the earth and the heaven. 
\v 10  Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
bear the ephah? 
\v 11  And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar:
and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains
\add were\add* mountains of brass. 
\v 2  In the first chariot \add were\add* red horses; and in the
second chariot black horses; 
\v 3  And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot
grisled and bay horses.\f + \fr 6.3  \ft bay: or, strong\f* 
\v 4  Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What
\add are\add* these, my lord? 
\v 5  And the angel answered and said unto me, These \add are\add*
the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the
Lord of all the earth.\f + \fr 6.5  \ft spirits: or, winds\f* 
\v 6  The black horses which \add are\add* therein go forth into the
north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled
go forth toward the south country. 
\v 7  And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and
fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro
through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
\v 8  Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that
go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 10  Take of \add them of\add* the captivity, \add even\add* of
Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon,
and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son
of Zephaniah; 
\v 11  Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set \add them\add*
upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
\v 12  And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name \add is\add* The BRANCH;
and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple
of the \nd LORD\nd*:\f + \fr 6.12  \ft grow…: or, branch up from under

both. 
\v 14  And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,
and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 15 And they \add that are\add* far off shall come and build in the
temple of the \nd LORD\nd*, and ye shall know that the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts hath sent me unto you. And \add this\add* shall come to pass, if ye will
diligently obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* your God. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, \add that\add*
the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto Zechariah in the fourth \add day\add*
of the ninth month, \add even\add* in Chisleu; 
\v 2  When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech,
and their men, to pray before the \nd LORD\nd*,\f + \fr 7.2  \ft pray…: Heb. intreat the face

in the house of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,
Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done
these so many years? 
\p
\v 4 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts unto me, saying,
\v 5  Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh \add month\add*,
even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, \add even\add* to me?
\v 6  And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat

\ft did not ye: or, be not ye they that\f* 
\v 7  \add Should ye\add* not \add hear\add* the words which the

\ft Execute…: Heb. Judge judgment of truth\f* 
\v 10  And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger,
nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother
in your heart. 
\v 11  But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder,
and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.\f + \fr 7.11 
\ft pulled…: Heb. they gave a backsliding shoulder\f*\f + \fr 7.11 
\ft stopped: Heb. made heavy\f* 
\v 12  Yea, they made their hearts \add as\add* an adamant stone,

of hosts: 
\v 14  But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed
through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.\f + \fr 7.14 
\ft pleasant…: Heb. land of desire\f* 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Again the word of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts came \add to me\add*,
saying, 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; I was jealous for Zion
with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. 
\v 3  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; I am returned unto Zion, and will
dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a
city of truth; and the mountain of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the
holy mountain. 
\v 4  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; There shall yet old men
and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his
staff in his hand for very age.\f + \fr 8.4  \ft very…: Heb. multitude of

\v 5  And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls

\v 6  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; If it be marvellous in the

\v 8  And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of

\p
\v 9 ¶ Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; Let your hands be strong,
ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which
\add were\add* in the day \add that\add* the foundation of the house
of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
\v 10  For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire

\v 12  For the seed \add shall be\add* prosperous; the vine shall

\v 14  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; As I thought to
punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, and I repented not: 
\v 15  So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

\v 16 ¶ These \add are\add* the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every

\p
\v 18 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts came unto me, saying,
\v 19  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; The fast of the fourth

saying, We will go with you: for we have heard \add that\add* God

\c 9  
\p
\v 1  The burden of the word of the \nd LORD\nd* in the land of Hadrach,
and Damascus \add shall be\add* the rest thereof: when the eyes of
man, as of all the tribes of Israel, \add shall be\add* toward the

\v 2  And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be
very wise. 
\v 3  And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver
as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
\v 4  Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power
in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
\v 5  Ashkelon shall see \add it\add*, and fear; Gaza also \add shall see

ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be
inhabited. 
\v 6  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the
pride of the Philistines. 
\v 7  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations
from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, \add shall

from sea \add even\add* to sea, and from the river \add even\add*
to the ends of the earth. 
\v 11  As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent

\v 12 ¶ Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to

\v 13  When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim,
and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made
thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
\v 14  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall be seen over them, and his arrow
shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord \nd GOD\nd* shall blow
the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. 
\v 15  The \nd LORD\nd* of hosts shall defend them; and they shall
devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, \add and\add*

\ft bright…: or, lightnings\f* 
\v 2  For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen
a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they

\ft were…: or, answered that, etc\f* 
\v 3  Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished

\ft punished: Heb. visited upon\f* 
\v 4  Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the

\v 5 ¶ And they shall be as mighty \add men\add*, which tread down
\add their enemies\add* in the mire of the streets in the battle:
and they shall fight, because the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* with them, and the
riders on horses shall be confounded.\f + \fr 10.5  \ft the riders…: or, they shall make the riders on horses

\v 6  And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have
mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them
off: for I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and will hear them.
\v 7 And \add they of\add* Ephraim shall be like a mighty \add man\add*,
and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children
shall see \add it\add*, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 8  I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed
them: and they shall increase as they have increased. 
\v 9  And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember
me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn
again. 
\v 10  I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of
Gilead and Lebanon; and \add place\add* shall not be found for them.
\v 11  And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry
up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre
of Egypt shall depart away. 
\v 12  And I will strengthen them in the \nd LORD\nd*; and they shall walk up and

\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
\v 2  Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty

\v 3 ¶ \add There is\add* a voice of the howling of the shepherds;
for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions;
for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. 
\p
\v 4  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
\v 5  Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:
and they that sell them say, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*;
for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. 
\v 6  For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite
the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver \add them\add*.\f + \fr 11.6 
\ft deliver: Heb. make to be found\f* 
\v 7  And I will feed the flock of slaughter, \add even\add* you,
O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called
Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.\f + \fr 11.7

\v 8  Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed

\v 9  Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest
eat every one the flesh of another.\f + \fr 11.9  \ft another: Heb. his fellow, or,

\p
\v 10 ¶ And I took my staff, \add even\add* Beauty, and cut it asunder,
that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.
\v 11  And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
that waited upon me knew that it \add was\add* the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 11.11 
\ft so…: or, the poor of the flock, etc. certainly knew\f* 
\v 12  And I said unto them, If ye think good, give \add me\add*
my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty

\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Cast it unto the potter:
a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty

\p
\v 15 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Take unto thee yet the

\v 16  For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, \add which\add*

though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
\v 4  In that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I will smite every horse
with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine

with blindness. 
\v 5  And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants

\p
\v 6 ¶ In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth

devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left:
and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, \add even\add*
in Jerusalem. 
\v 7  The \nd LORD\nd* also shall save the tents of Judah first,

of Jerusalem do not magnify \add themselves\add* against Judah.

mourneth for \add his\add* only \add son\add*, and shall be in bitterness
for him, as one that is in bitterness for \add his\add* firstborn.
\v 11  In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem,
