\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
\v 2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
man of you bring an offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*, ye shall bring
your offering of the cattle, \add even\add* of the herd, and of the
flock. 
\p
\v 3  If his offering \add be\add* a burnt sacrifice of the herd,
let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary
will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 4  And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
\v 5  And he shall kill the bullock before the \nd LORD\nd*: and the
priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood
round about upon the altar that \add is by\add* the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation. 
\v 6  And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.
\v 7  And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,
and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 
\v 8  And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
and the fat, in order upon the wood that \add is\add* on the fire which
\add is\add* upon the altar: 
\v 9  But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
priest shall burn all on the altar, \add to be\add* a burnt sacrifice,
an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And if his offering \add be\add* of the flocks, \add namely\add*,
of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring
it a male without blemish. 
\v 11  And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
the \nd LORD\nd*: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his
blood round about upon the altar. 
\v 12  And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that \add is\add*
on the fire which \add is\add* upon the altar: 
\v 13  But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
priest shall bring \add it\add* all, and burn \add it\add* upon the
altar: it \add is\add* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire,
of a sweet savour unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the \nd LORD\nd*
\add be\add* of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves,
or of young pigeons. 
\v 15  And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off

\v 17  And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, \add but\add* shall not divide
\add it\add* asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar,
upon the wood that \add is\add* upon the fire: it \add is\add* a burnt
sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And when any will offer a meat offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
his offering shall be \add of\add* fine flour; and he shall pour
oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: 
\v 2  And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall
take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the
frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the
altar, \add to be\add* an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
unto the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 3  And the remnant of the meat offering \add shall be\add* Aaron’s
and his sons’: \add it is\add* a thing most holy of the offerings
of the \nd LORD\nd* made by fire. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
oven, \add it shall be\add* unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled

\nd LORD\nd*: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall
bring it unto the altar. 
\v 9  And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
thereof, and shall burn \add it\add* upon the altar: \add it is\add*
an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 10  And that which is left of the meat offering \add shall be\add*
Aaron’s and his sons’: \add it is\add* a thing most holy of the offerings
of the \nd LORD\nd* made by fire. 
\p
\v 11  No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
in any offering of the \nd LORD\nd* made by fire. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the
\nd LORD\nd*: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet
savour.\f + \fr 2.12  \ft be burnt: Heb. ascend\f* 
\v 13  And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season

\v 14  And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
\nd LORD\nd*, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits
green ears of corn dried by the fire, \add even\add* corn beaten

and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar
round about. 
\v 3  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by

\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall
sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*
\add concerning things\add* which ought not to be done, and shall
do against any of them: 
\v 3  If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin
of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned,
a young bullock without blemish unto the \nd LORD\nd* for a sin offering.
\v 4  And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle

unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the

\v 13 ¶ And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have
done \add somewhat against\add* any of the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*
\add concerning things\add* which should not be done, and are guilty;
\v 14  When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and
bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 15  And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
head of the bullock before the \nd LORD\nd*: and the bullock shall be
killed before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s
blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 17  And the priest shall dip his finger \add in some\add* of the
blood, and sprinkle \add it\add* seven times before the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add even\add* before the vail. 
\v 18  And he shall put \add some\add* of the blood upon the horns
of the altar which \add is\add* before the \nd LORD\nd*, that \add is\add*
in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the
blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which \add is
at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 19  And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn \add it\add*
upon the altar. 
\v 20  And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an
atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 
\v 21  And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
burn him as he burned the first bullock: it \add is\add* a sin offering
for the congregation. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ When a ruler hath sinned, and done \add somewhat\add* through
ignorance \add against\add* any of the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*
his God \add concerning things\add* which should not be done, and is
guilty; 
\v 23  Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:
\v 24  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the \nd LORD\nd*: it
\add is\add* a sin offering. 
\v 25  And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
with his finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar
of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the
altar of burnt offering. 
\v 26  And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement
for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
while he doeth \add somewhat against\add* any of the commandments

\v 28  Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without

\v 29  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. 
\v 30  And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,
and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
\v 31  And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken
away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall

with his finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar
of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the

lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the
priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by
fire unto the \nd LORD\nd*: and the priest shall make an atonement
for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and \add is\add*
a witness, whether he hath seen or known \add of it;\add* if he do not
utter \add it\add*, then he shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 2  Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether \add it be\add*
a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
carcase of unclean creeping things, and \add if\add* it be hidden
from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty. 
\v 3  Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
\add it be\add* that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid
from him; when he knoweth \add of it\add*, then he shall be guilty.
\v 4  Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with \add his\add* lips to do
evil, or to do good, whatsoever \add it be\add* that a man shall
pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth \add of

\v 5  And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these \add things\add*,
that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that \add thing:\add*
\v 6  And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*
for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb
or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an
atonement for him concerning his sin. 
\p
\v 7  And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring

\add is\add* a sin offering. 
\v 12  Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
take his handful of it, \add even\add* a memorial thereof, and burn
\add it\add* on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire
unto the \nd LORD\nd*: it \add is\add* a sin offering. 
\v 13  And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and
\add the remnant\add* shall be the priest’s, as a meat offering.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 15  If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy
things of the \nd LORD\nd*; then he shall bring for his trespass
unto the \nd LORD\nd* a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy
estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary,
for a trespass offering: 
\v 16  And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy
thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the
priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram
of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be
done by the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*; though he wist \add it\add*
not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 18  And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,

priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he
erred and wist \add it\add* not, and it shall be forgiven him. 
\v 19 It \add is\add* a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
against the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying,

restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully
gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing
which he found, 
\v 5  Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even

offering, unto the priest: 
\v 7  And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the \nd LORD\nd*:
and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done
in trespassing therein. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 9  Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This \add is\add* the law
of the burnt offering: It \add is\add* the burnt offering, because of the

\v 10  And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen

put them beside the altar. 
\v 11  And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 
\v 12  And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put
out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt
offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace
offerings. 
\v 13  The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
out. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And this \add is\add* the law of the meat offering: the sons
of Aaron shall offer it before the \nd LORD\nd*, before the altar.
\v 15  And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which
\add is\add* upon the meat offering, and shall burn \add it\add*
upon the altar \add for\add* a sweet savour, \add even\add* the memorial
of it, unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened
bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle
of the congregation they shall eat it. 
\v 17  It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it \add unto them
for\add* their portion of my offerings made by fire; it \add is\add*
most holy, as \add is\add* the sin offering, and as the trespass
offering. 
\v 18  All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it.
\add It shall be\add* a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
offerings of the \nd LORD\nd* made by fire: every one that toucheth
them shall be holy. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 20 This \add is\add* the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall

\v 21  In a pan it shall be made with oil; \add and when it is\add*
baken, thou shalt bring it in: \add and\add* the baken pieces of the meat
offering shalt thou offer \add for\add* a sweet savour unto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22  And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall

it shall be wholly burnt. 
\v 23  For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
it shall not be eaten. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 25  Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This \add is\add*
the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering
is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the \nd LORD\nd*: it
\add is\add* most holy. 
\v 26  The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\v 27  Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is
sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash
that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 
\v 28  But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and
rinsed in water. 
\v 29  All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it \add is\add*
most holy. 
\v 30  And no sin offering, whereof \add any\add* of the blood is
brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile \add withal\add*
in the holy \add place\add*, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the
fire. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Likewise this \add is\add* the law of the trespass offering: it
\add is\add* most holy. 
\v 2  In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle
round about upon the altar. 
\v 3  And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
fat that covereth the inwards, 
\v 4  And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* on them, which
\add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul \add that is\add* above the
liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 
\v 5  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar \add for\add*
an offering made by fire unto the \nd LORD\nd*: it \add is\add* a trespass
offering. 
\v 6  Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
eaten in the holy place: it \add is\add* most holy. 
\v 7  As the sin offering \add is\add*, so \add is\add* the trespass
offering: \add there is\add* one law for them: the priest that maketh
atonement therewith shall have \add it\add*. 
\v 8  And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, \add even\add*
the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath
offered. 
\v 9  And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is
dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that
offereth it.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft in the pan: or, on the flat plate or,
slice\f* 
\v 10  And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
sons of Aaron have, one \add as much\add* as another. 
\p
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
which he shall offer unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 12  If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and
unleavened wafers anointed  with oil, and cakes mingled with oil,
of fine flour, fried. 
\v 13  Besides the cakes, he shall offer \add for\add* his offering
leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
\v 14  And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation \add for\add*
an heave offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* it shall be the
priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. 
\v 15  And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not
leave any of it until the morning. 
\v 16  But if the sacrifice of his offering \add be\add* a vow, or a voluntary
offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice:
and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: 
\v 17  But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
day shall be burnt with fire. 
\v 18 And if \add any\add* of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted,
neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an
abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
\v 19  And the flesh that toucheth any unclean \add thing\add* shall not be
eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be
clean shall eat thereof. 
\v 20  But the soul that eateth \add of\add* the flesh of the sacrifice
of peace offerings, that \add pertain\add* unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off
from his people. 
\v 21  Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean \add thing,
as\add* the uncleanness of man, or \add any\add* unclean beast, or any
abominable unclean \add thing\add*, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice
of peace offerings, which \add pertain\add* unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of
fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. 
\v 24  And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat
of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
but ye shall in no wise eat of it.\f + \fr 7.24  \ft beast…: Heb.
carcase\f* 
\v 25  For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
an offering made by fire unto the \nd LORD\nd*, even the soul that
eateth \add it\add* shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 26  Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, \add whether it
be\add* of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 
\v 27  Whatsoever soul \add it be\add* that eateth any manner of
blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 29  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the \nd LORD\nd* shall
bring his oblation unto the \nd LORD\nd* of the sacrifice of his peace
offerings. 
\v 30  His own hands shall bring the offerings of the \nd LORD\nd*
made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
breast may be waved \add for\add* a wave offering before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 31  And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. 
\v 32  And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest \add for\add*
an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
\v 33  He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for \add his\add*
part. 
\v 34  For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a
statute for ever from among the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ This \add is the portion\add* of the anointing of Aaron,
and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the \nd LORD\nd*
made by fire, in the day \add when\add* he presented them to minister unto the
\nd LORD\nd* in the priest’s office; 
\v 36  Which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  to be given them of the
children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, \add by\add*
a statute for ever throughout their generations. 
\v 37 This \add is\add* the law of the burnt offering, of the meat
offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering,
and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
\v 38  Which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  Moses in mount Sinai, in the
day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
unto the \nd LORD\nd*, in the wilderness of Sinai. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams,
and a basket of unleavened bread; 
\v 3  And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4  And Moses did as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded him; and the assembly
was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\v 5  And Moses said unto the congregation, This \add is\add* the
thing which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded to be done. 
\v 6  And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
water. 
\v 7  And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he
girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound \add it\add* unto him therewith.
\v 8  And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate
the Urim and the Thummim. 
\v 9  And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, \add even\add*
upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown;
as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses. 
\v 10  And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that
\add was\add* therein, and sanctified them. 
\v 11  And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.
\v 12  And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and
anointed him, to sanctify him. 
\v 13  And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and
girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded Moses.\f + \fr 8.13  \ft put bonnets: Heb. bound bonnets\f*
\p
\v 14  And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin
offering. 
\v 15  And he slew \add it;\add* and Moses took the blood, and put
\add it\add* upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger,
and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the
altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. 
\v 16  And he took all the fat that \add was\add* upon the inwards,
and the caul \add above\add* the liver, and the two kidneys, and their
fat, and Moses burned \add it\add* upon the altar. 
\v 17  But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
burnt with fire without the camp; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 19  And he killed \add it;\add* and Moses sprinkled the blood
upon the altar round about. 
\v 20  And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head,
and the pieces, and the fat. 
\v 21  And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it \add was\add* a burnt sacrifice
for a sweet savour, \add and\add* an offering made by fire unto the
\nd LORD\nd*; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 23  And he slew \add it;\add* and Moses took of the blood of it, and
put \add it\add* upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the
thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
\v 24  And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the
tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands,
and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled
the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 25  And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that \add was\add*
upon the inwards, and the caul \add above\add* the liver, and the
two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: 
\v 26  And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that \add was\add*
before the \nd LORD\nd*, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake
of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put \add them\add* on the fat,
and upon the right shoulder: 
\v 27  And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands,
and waved them \add for\add* a wave offering before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 28  And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt \add them\add*
on the altar upon the burnt offering: they \add were\add* consecrations
for a sweet savour: it \add is\add* an offering made by fire unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 29  And Moses took the breast, and waved it \add for\add* a wave
offering before the \nd LORD\nd*: \add for\add* of the ram of consecration
it was Moses’ part; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses. 
\v 30  And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
\add was\add* upon the altar, and sprinkled \add it\add* upon Aaron,
\add and\add* upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his
sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, \add and\add* his
garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh
\add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there
eat it with the bread that \add is\add* in the basket of consecrations,
as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 
\v 32  And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
burn with fire. 
\v 33  And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation \add in\add* seven days, until the days of your consecration
be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you. 
\v 34  As he hath done this day, \add so\add* the \nd LORD\nd* hath
commanded to do, to make an atonement for you. 
\v 35  Therefore shall ye abide \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge
of the \nd LORD\nd*, that ye die not: for so I am commanded. 
\v 36  So Aaron and his sons did all things which the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded by the hand of Moses. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass on the eighth day, \add that\add* Moses
called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
\v 2  And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering,
and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer \add them\add*
before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 3  And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb,
\add both\add* of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
\v 4  Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
before the \nd LORD\nd*; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
day the \nd LORD\nd* will appear unto you. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And they brought \add that\add* which Moses commanded before
the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
near and stood before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* shall
appear unto you. 
\v 7  And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the
people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement
for them; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
offering, which \add was\add* for himself. 
\v 9  And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped
his finger in the blood, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the
altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 
\v 10  But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver
of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded Moses. 
\v 11  And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
camp. 
\v 12  And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented
unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
\v 13  And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
thereof, and the head: and he burnt \add them\add* upon the altar.
\v 14  And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt \add them\add*
upon the burnt offering on the altar. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which
\add was\add* the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for
sin, as the first. 
\v 16  And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the
manner.\f + \fr 9.16  \ft manner: or, ordinance\f* 
\v 17  And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and
burnt \add it\add* upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
morning.\f + \fr 9.17  \ft took…: Heb. filled his hand out of it\f*
\v 18  He slew also the bullock and the ram \add for\add* a sacrifice
of peace offerings, which \add was\add* for the people: and Aaron’s
sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar
round about, 
\v 19  And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which
covereth \add the inwards\add*, and the kidneys, and the caul \add above\add*
the liver: 
\v 20  And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
upon the altar: 
\v 21  And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved \add for\add*
a wave offering before the \nd LORD\nd*; as Moses commanded. 
\v 22  And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt
offering, and peace offerings. 
\p
\v 23  And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd*
appeared unto all the people. 
\v 24  And there came a fire out from before the \nd LORD\nd*, and
consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: \add which\add*
when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his
censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered
strange fire before the \nd LORD\nd*, which he commanded them not.
\v 2  And there went out fire from the \nd LORD\nd*, and devoured
them, and they died before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 3  Then Moses said unto Aaron, This \add is it\add* that the \nd LORD\nd*
spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
\v 4  And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren
from before the sanctuary out of the camp. 
\v 5  So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
camp; as Moses had said. 
\v 6  And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye
die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren,
the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the \nd LORD\nd*
hath kindled. 
\v 7  And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the \nd LORD\nd*
\add is\add* upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 9  Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye
go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: \add it shall
be\add* a statute for ever throughout your generations: 
\v 10  And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between
unclean and clean; 
\v 11  And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
which the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the
offerings of the \nd LORD\nd* made by fire, and eat it without leaven
beside the altar: for it \add is\add* most holy: 
\v 13  And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it \add is\add*
thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the \nd LORD\nd*
made by fire: for so I am commanded. 
\v 14  And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for \add they
be\add* thy due, and thy sons’ due, \add which\add* are given out of the
sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
\v 15  The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by
fire of the fat, to wave \add it for\add* a wave offering before
the \nd LORD\nd*; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a
statute for ever; as the \nd LORD\nd* hath commanded. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering,
and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar,
the sons of Aaron \add which were\add* left \add alive\add*, saying,
\v 17  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it
\add is\add* most holy, and \add God\add* hath given it you to bear
the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before
the \nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 18  Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
\add place:\add* ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy \add place\add*,
as I commanded. 
\v 19  And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the \nd LORD\nd*;
and such things have befallen me: and \add if\add* I had eaten the sin
offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 20  And when Moses heard \add that\add*, he was content. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
\v 2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These \add are\add*
the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that \add are\add*
on the earth. 
\v 3  Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, \add and\add*
cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 
\v 4  Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
or of them that divide the hoof: \add as\add* the camel, because he
cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he \add is\add* unclean unto you.
\v 5  And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
hoof; he \add is\add* unclean unto you. 
\v 6  And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
hoof; he \add is\add* unclean unto you. 
\v 7  And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
yet he cheweth not the cud; he \add is\add* unclean to you. 
\v 8  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
touch; they \add are\add* unclean to you. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ These shall ye eat of all that \add are\add* in the waters:
whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
rivers, them shall ye eat. 
\v 10  And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which
\add is\add* in the waters, they \add shall be\add* an abomination unto you:
\v 11  They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.
\v 12  Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that \add shall
be\add* an abomination unto you. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And these \add are they which\add* ye shall have in abomination
among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they \add are\add* an abomination:
the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 
\v 14  And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
\v 15  Every raven after his kind; 
\v 16  And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
after his kind, 
\v 17  And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
\v 18  And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 
\v 19  And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,
and the bat. 
\p
\v 20  All fowls that creep, going upon \add all\add* four, \add shall
be\add* an abomination unto you. 
\v 21  Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon
\add all\add* four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal
upon the earth; 
\v 22  \add Even\add* these of them ye may eat; the locust after his

\v 23 But all \add other\add* flying creeping things, which have

\v 24  And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the

\v 26  \add The carcases\add* of every beast which divideth the hoof, and

that go on \add all\add* four, those \add are\add* unclean unto you: whoso
toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 28  And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even: they \add are\add* unclean unto you.
\p
\v 29 ¶ These also \add shall be\add* unclean unto you among the creeping
things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
tortoise after his kind, 
\v 30  And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the

\v 31 These \add are\add* unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth

\v 32 And upon whatsoever \add any\add* of them, when they are dead,

\v 33  And every earthen vessel, whereinto \add any\add* of them

And he did as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.

\add it\add* out of the camp, 
\v 4  And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the

\v 5  To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices,
which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the

or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of

and will cut him off from among his people. 
\v 11  For the life of the flesh \add is\add* in the blood: and I have

\v 13  And whatsoever man \add there be\add* of the children of Israel,
