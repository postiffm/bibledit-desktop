\v 1  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
of the \nd LORD\nd* by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled,
the \nd LORD\nd* stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a

writing, saying,\f + \fr 1.1  \ft made…: Heb. caused a voice to pass\f*
\v 2  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The \nd LORD\nd* God of heaven
hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged
me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which \add is\add* in Judah.
\v 3 Who \add is there\add* among you of all his people? his God
be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which \add is\add* in
Judah, and build the house of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, (he
\add is\add* the God,) which \add is\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 4  And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the

and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that
\add is\add* in Jerusalem.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft help…: Heb. lift him

God had raised, to go up to build the house of the \nd LORD\nd* which
\add is\add* in Jerusalem.

\v 68 ¶ And \add some\add* of the chief of the fathers, when they

offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place: 
\v 69  They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound

\v 70  So the priests, and the Levites, and \add some\add* of the
people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt
in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel
\add were\add* in the cities, the people gathered themselves together
as one man to Jerusalem. 
\v 2  Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and
builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as
\add it is\add* written in the law of Moses the man of God.\f + \fr 3.2

\v 3  And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear \add was\add*
upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered
burnt offerings thereon unto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add even\add* burnt
offerings morning and evening. 
\v 4  They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as \add it is\add*
written, and \add offered\add* the daily burnt offerings by number,
according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;\f + \fr 3.4

that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill
offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
burnt offerings unto the \nd LORD\nd*. But the foundation of the
temple of the \nd LORD\nd* was not \add yet\add* laid.\f + \fr 3.6 
\ft the foundation…: Heb. the temple of the \+nd LORD\+nd* was not yet
founded\f* 
\v 7  They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of
Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the
grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.\f + \fr 3.7  \ft carpenters: or,
workmen\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren
the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the
captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty
years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  Then stood Jeshua \add with\add* his sons and his brethren,
Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward
the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, \add with\add*
their sons and their brethren the Levites.\f + \fr 3.9  \ft Judah: also called,
Hodaviah\f*\f + \fr 3.9  \ft together: Heb. as one\f* 
\v 10  And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
\nd LORD\nd*, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets,
and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the \nd LORD\nd*,
after the ordinance of David king of Israel. 
\v 11  And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
unto the \nd LORD\nd*; because \add he is\add* good, for his mercy
\add endureth\add* for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted
with a great shout, when they praised the \nd LORD\nd*, because the
foundation of the house of the \nd LORD\nd* was laid. 
\v 12  But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers,
\add who were\add* ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a
loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: 
\v 13  So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout
of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people
shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded the temple unto the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel;\f + \fr 4.1  \ft the children…: Heb. the sons of the
transportation\f* 
\v 2  Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye
\add do;\add* and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon
king of Assur, which brought us up hither. 
\v 3  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to
build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build
unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia
hath commanded us. 
\v 4  Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
of Judah, and troubled them in building, 
\v 5  And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose,
all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius
king of Persia. 
\p
\v 6  And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
wrote they \add unto him\add* an accusation against the inhabitants
of Judah and Jerusalem.\f + \fr 4.6  \ft Ahasuerus: Heb. Ahashverosh\f*
\p
\v 7 ¶ And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;
and the writing of the letter \add was\add* written in the Syrian
tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.\f + \fr 4.7  \ft Bishlam: or, in

\v 8  Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:\f + \fr 4.8 
\ft scribe: or, secretary\f* 
\v 9  Then \add wrote\add* Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the

the Susanchites, the Dehavites, \add and\add* the Elamites,\f + \fr 4.9

\ft at such…: Chaldee, Cheeneth\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ This \add is\add* the copy of the letter that they sent unto
him, \add even\add* unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men
on this side the river, and at such a time. 
\v 12  Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from

the foundations.\f + \fr 4.12  \ft set up: or, finished\f*\f + \fr 4.12 
\ft joined: Chaldee, sewed together\f* 
\v 13  Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
and the walls set up \add again, then\add* will they not pay toll,

of the kings.\f + \fr 4.13  \ft pay: Chaldee, give\f*\f + \fr 4.13 
\ft revenue: or, strength\f* 
\v 14  Now because we have maintenance from \add the king’s\add*

have we sent and certified the king;\f + \fr 4.14  \ft we have…: Chaldee, we are salted with the salt of the

\v 15  That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know
that this city \add is\add* a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings
and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same
of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. \f + \fr 4.15 
\ft moved: Chaldee, made\f*\f + \fr 4.15  \ft within…: Chaldee, in the midst

\v 16  We certify the king that, if this city be builded \add again\add*,
and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion
on this side the river. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ \add Then\add* sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and
\add to\add* Shimshai the scribe, and \add to\add* the rest of their

\v 18  The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
\v 19  And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and

\ft I commanded: Chaldee, by me a decree is set\f*\f + \fr 4.19

\v 20  There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have

\v 21  Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that

\v 22  Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
grow to the hurt of the kings? 
\p
\v 23 ¶ Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter \add was\add*
read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions,
they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
cease by force and power.\f + \fr 4.23  \ft by force…: Chaldee, by arm and

\v 24  Then ceased the work of the house of God which \add is\add*
at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius
king of Persia. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that \add were\add* in Judah and

\v 2  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the

at Jerusalem: and with them \add were\add* the prophets of God helping them.
\p
\v 3 ¶ At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side

unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make

\v 5  But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could

\p
\v 6 ¶ The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side
the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which
\add were\add* on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:
\v 7  They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto

\v 9  Then asked we those elders, \add and\add* said unto them thus,
Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
\v 10  We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
write the names of the men that \add were\add* the chief of them.
\v 11  And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded
these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set
up. 
\v 12  But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven
unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the
people away into Babylon. 
\v 13  But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon \add the
same\add* king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. 
\v 14  And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that \add was\add* in
Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did
Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto

made governor;\f + \fr 5.14  \ft governor: or, deputy\f* 
\v 15  And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
temple that \add is\add* in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
builded in his place. 
\v 16  Then came the same Sheshbazzar, \add and\add* laid the foundation
of the house of God which \add is\add* in Jerusalem: and since that
time even until now hath it been in building, and \add yet\add* it is
not finished. 
\v 17  Now therefore, if \add it seem\add* good to the king, let there be
search made in the king’s treasure house, which \add is\add* there
at Babylon, whether it be \add so\add*, that a decree was made of
Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the
king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the

\v 3  In the first year of Cyrus the king \add the same\add* Cyrus

\v 5  And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of

\v 8  Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s
goods, \add even\add* of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.\f + \fr 6.8

\v 9  And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and

salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which
\add are\add* at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without

\v 11  Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this

\v 12  And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter \add and\add*

have made a decree; let it be done with speed. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai,
and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had
sent, so they did speedily. 
\v 14  And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the
prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.
And they builded, and finished \add it\add*, according to the commandment
of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus,
and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\f + \fr 6.14  \ft commandment: Chaldee,

\v 15  And this house was finished on the third day of the month
Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites,
and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication
of this house of God with joy,\f + \fr 6.16  \ft the children of the captivity: Chaldee, the sons of the

\v 17  And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering
for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes
of Israel. 
\v 18  And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
in their courses, for the service of God, which \add is\add* at Jerusalem;
as it is written in the book of Moses.\f + \fr 6.18  \ft as it is…: Chaldee, according to the

\v 19  And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the

\v 20  For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them
\add were\add* pure, and killed the passover for all the children
of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
\v 21  And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity,
and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness
of the heathen of the land, to seek the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
did eat, 
\v 22  And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
for the \nd LORD\nd* had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work
of the house of God, the God of Israel. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
\v 2  The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
\v 3  The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
\v 4  The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
\v 5  The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the chief priest: 
\v 6  This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he \add was\add* a ready
scribe in the law of Moses, which the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel
had given: and the king granted  him all his request, according to the
hand of the \nd LORD\nd* his God upon him. 
\v 7  And there went up \add some\add* of the children of Israel,
and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes
the king. 
\v 8  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which \add was\add*
in the seventh year of the king. 
\v 9  For upon the first \add day\add* of the first month began he to go
up from Babylon, and on the first \add day\add* of the fifth month
came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon
him.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft began…: Heb. was the foundation of the going
up\f* 
\v 10  For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and to do \add it\add*, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now this \add is\add* the copy of the letter that the king
Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, \add even\add*
a scribe of the words of the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*, and of his
statutes to Israel. 
\v 12  Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe

\v 13  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and
\add of\add* his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own
freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. 
\v 14  Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors,
to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy
God which \add is\add* in thine hand;\f + \fr 7.14  \ft of the king: Chaldee, from before the
king\f* 
\v 15  And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors
have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation \add is\add*
in Jerusalem, 
\v 16  And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the
priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which \add is\add*
in Jerusalem: 
\v 17  That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams,
lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer
them upon the altar of the house of your God which \add is\add* in
Jerusalem. 
\v 18  And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the
will of your God. 
\v 19  The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
house of thy God, \add those\add* deliver thou before the God of
Jerusalem. 
\v 20  And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy
God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow \add it\add*
out of the king’s treasure house. 
\v 21  And I, \add even\add* I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree
to all the treasurers which \add are\add* beyond the river, that whatsoever
Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
require of you, it be done speedily, 
\v 22  Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures
of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths
of oil, and salt without prescribing \add how much\add*.\f + \fr 7.22 
\ft measures: Chaldee, cors\f* 
\v 23  Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently

\v 24  Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house
of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom,
upon them. 
\v 25  And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that \add is\add*
in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
people that \add are\add* beyond the river, all such as know the
laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know \add them\add* not.
\v 26  And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law
of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
\add it be\add* unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation
of goods, or to imprisonment.\f + \fr 7.26  \ft to banishment: Chaldee, to rooting

\p
\v 27 ¶ Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of our fathers,
which hath put \add such a thing\add* as this in the king’s heart,
to beautify the house of the \nd LORD\nd* which \add is\add* in Jerusalem:
\v 28  And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors,
and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened
as the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* my God \add was\add* upon me, and I gathered
together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* now the chief of their fathers, and \add this
is\add* the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon,
in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. 
\v 2  Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
of the sons of David; Hattush. 
\v 3  Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and
fifty. 
\v 4  Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah,
and with him two hundred males. 
\v 5  Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
three hundred males. 
\v 6  Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him
fifty males. 
\v 7  And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him
seventy males. 
\v 8  And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
and with him fourscore males. 
\v 9  Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
hundred and eighteen males. 
\v 10  And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an
hundred and threescore males. 
\v 11  And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him
twenty and eight males. 
\v 12  And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an
hundred and ten males.\f + \fr 8.12  \ft the son…: or, the youngest

\v 13  And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names \add are\add*
these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.
\v 14  Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
seventy males.\f + \fr 8.14  \ft Zabbud: or, Zaccur, as some read\f*
\p
\v 15 ¶ And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people,
and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.\f + \fr 8.15 
\ft abode: or, pitched\f* 
\v 16  Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for
Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for
Elnathan, men of understanding. 
\v 17  And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, \add and\add*
to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should
bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.\f + \fr 8.17  \ft I told…: Heb. I put words in their
mouth\f* 
\v 18  And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a
man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
\v 19  And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
his brethren and their sons, twenty; 
\v 20  Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed
for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims:
all of them were expressed by name. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might
afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little
ones, and for all our substance. 
\v 22  For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had
spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God \add is\add* upon all them for
good that seek him; but his power and his wrath \add is\add* against all them that
forsake him. 
\v 23  So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 
\v 25  And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,
\add even\add* the offering of the house of our God, which the king,
and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel \add there\add*
present, had offered: 
\v 26  I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, \add and\add* of
gold an hundred talents; 
\v 27  Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels
of fine copper, precious as gold.\f + \fr 8.27  \ft fine…: Heb. yellow, or, shining
brass\f*\f + \fr 8.27  \ft precious: Heb. desirable\f* 
\v 28  And I said unto them, Ye \add are\add* holy unto the \nd LORD\nd*;
the vessels \add are\add* holy also; and the silver and the gold
\add are\add* a freewill offering unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of your
fathers. 
\v 29  Watch ye, and keep \add them\add*, until ye weigh \add them\add*
before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the
fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 30  So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
and the gold, and the vessels, to bring \add them\add* to Jerusalem
unto the house of our God. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth \add day\add*
of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in
wait by the way. 
\v 32  And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
vessels weighed  in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth
the son of Uriah the priest; and with him \add was\add* Eleazar the
son of Phinehas; and with them \add was\add* Jozabad the son of Jeshua,
and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; 
\v 34  By number \add and\add* by weight of every one: and all the
weight was written at that time. 
\v 35  \add Also\add* the children of those that had been carried
away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings
unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats \add for\add*
a sin offering: all \add this was\add* a burnt offering unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s
lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they
furthered the people, and the house of God. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying,
The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not
separated themselves from the people of the lands, \add doing\add*
according to their abominations, \add even\add* of the Canaanites,
the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,
the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
\v 2  For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their
sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of
\add those\add* lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been
chief in this trespass. 
\v 3  And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,
and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down
astonied. 
\v 4  Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the
words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried
away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness;
and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread
out my hands unto the \nd LORD\nd* my God,\f + \fr 9.5  \ft heaviness: or,
affliction\f* 
\v 6  And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over \add our\add*
head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.\f + \fr 9.6 
\ft trespass: or, guiltiness\f* 
\v 7  Since the days of our fathers \add have\add* we \add been\add*
in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our
kings, \add and\add* our priests, been delivered into the hand of the
kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
confusion of face, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 8  And now for a little space grace hath been \add shewed\add*
from the \nd LORD\nd* our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to
give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,
and give us a little reviving in our bondage.\f + \fr 9.8  \ft space: Heb.
moment\f*\f + \fr 9.8  \ft a nail: or, a pin: that is, a constant and sure
abode\f* 
\v 9 For we \add were\add* bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken
us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the
kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our
God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall
in Judah and in Jerusalem.\f + \fr 9.9  \ft to repair: Heb. to set
up\f* 
\v 10  And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
forsaken thy commandments, 
\v 11  Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying,
The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the
filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have
filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.\f + \fr 9.11 
\ft by: Heb. by the hand of\f*\f + \fr 9.11  \ft from…: Heb. from mouth to

\v 12  Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their
wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave
\add it\add* for an inheritance to your children for ever. 
\v 13  And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our
great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our
iniquities \add deserve\add*, and hast given us \add such\add* deliverance as
this;\f + \fr 9.13  \ft hast punished…: Heb. hast withheld beneath our
iniquities\f* 
\v 14  Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry
with us till thou hadst consumed \add us\add*, so that \add there should
be\add* no remnant nor escaping? 
\v 15  O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, thou \add art\add* righteous:
for we remain yet escaped, as \add it is\add* this day: behold, we
\add are\add* before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand
before thee because of this. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping
and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled
unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women
and children: for the people wept very sore.\f + \fr 10.1  \ft wept…: Heb. wept a great
weeping\f* 
\v 2  And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, \add one\add* of the sons
of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our
God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there
is hope in Israel concerning this thing. 
\v 3  Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away
all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel
of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God;
and let it be done according to the law.\f + \fr 10.3  \ft to put…: Heb. to bring

\v 4  Arise; for \add this\add* matter \add belongeth\add* unto thee: we also
\add will be\add* with thee: be of good courage, and do \add it\add*.
\v 5  Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they
sware. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the
chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and \add when\add* he came
thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the
transgression of them that had been carried away. 
\v 7  And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the
children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together
unto Jerusalem; 
\v 8  And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the
counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be
forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried
away.\f + \fr 10.8  \ft forfeited: Heb. devoted\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
together unto Jerusalem within three days. It \add was\add* the ninth
month, on the twentieth \add day\add* of the month; and all the people
sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of \add this\add*

\v 10  And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have

\v 11  Now therefore make confession unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of your

of the land, and from the strange wives. 
\v 12  Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
As thou hast said, so must we do. 
\v 13  But the people \add are\add* many, and \add it is\add* a time
of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither \add is

\v 14  Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have

of our God for this matter be turned from us.\f + \fr 10.14  \ft for this…: or, till this matter be

\p
\v 15 ¶ Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
were employed about this \add matter:\add* and Meshullam and Shabbethai
the Levite helped them.\f + \fr 10.15  \ft were…: Heb. stood\f* 
\v 16  And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
\add with\add* certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their

and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\v 17  And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
wives by the first day of the first month. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
taken strange wives: \add namely\add*, of the sons of Jeshua the
son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib,
and Gedaliah. 
\v 19  And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and
\add being\add* guilty, \add they offered\add* a ram of the flock
for their trespass. 
\v 20  And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah. 
\v 21  And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
and Jehiel, and Uzziah. 
\v 22  And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel,
Jozabad, and Elasah. 
\v 23  Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same

\v 26  And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel,
and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah. 
\v 27  And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
