\v 1  Now after the death of Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*
it came to pass, that the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Joshua the son
of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying, 
\v 2  Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them,
\add even\add* to the children of Israel. 
\v 3  Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
given unto you, as I said unto Moses. 
\v 4  From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,
the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great
sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. 
\v 5  There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
days of thy life: as I was with Moses, \add so\add* I will be with thee: I will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee. 
\v 6  Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an
inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.\f + \fr 1.6 
\ft unto this…: or, thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land,
etc\f* 
\v 7  Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded
thee: turn not from it \add to\add* the right hand or \add to\add*
the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft prosper: or, do wisely\f* 
\v 8  This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt
meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is
written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good
success.\f + \fr 1.8  \ft have…: or, do wisely\f* 
\v 9  Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage;
be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the \nd LORD\nd* thy
God \add is\add* with thee whithersoever thou goest. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\v 11  Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan,
to go in to possess the land, which the \nd LORD\nd* your God giveth
 you to possess it. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 
\v 13  Remember the word which Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded you, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* your God hath given you rest,
and hath given you this land. 
\v 14  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain
in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall
pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and
help them;\f + \fr 1.14  \ft armed: Heb. marshalled by five\f* 
\v 15  Until the \nd LORD\nd* have given your brethren rest, as \add he hath
given\add* you, and they also have possessed the land which the \nd LORD\nd*
your God giveth  them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the \nd LORD’s\nd* servant
gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest
us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. 
\v 17  According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
hearken unto thee: only the \nd LORD\nd* thy God be with thee, as he was with
Moses. 
\v 18  Whosoever \add he be\add* that doth rebel against thy commandment,
and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to
death: only be strong and of a good courage. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went,
and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.\f + \fr 2.1 
\ft sent: or, had sent\f*\f + \fr 2.1  \ft lodged: Heb. lay\f* 
\v 2  And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out
the country. 
\v 3  And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house:
for they be come to search out all the country. 
\v 4  And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
came men unto me, but I wist not whence they \add were:\add* 
\v 5 And it came to pass \add about the time\add* of shutting of the
gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
\v 6  But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the
roof. 
\v 7  And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:
and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they
shut the gate. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
roof; 
\v 9  And she said unto the men, I know that the \nd LORD\nd* hath
given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the
inhabitants of the land faint because of you.\f + \fr 2.9  \ft faint: Heb.
melt\f* 
\v 10  For we have heard how the \nd LORD\nd* dried up the water
of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did
unto the two kings of the Amorites, that \add were\add* on the other
side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. 
\v 11  And as soon as we had heard \add these things\add*, our hearts
did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
of you: for the \nd LORD\nd* your God, he \add is\add* God in heaven
above, and in earth beneath.\f + \fr 2.11  \ft did there…: Heb. rose
up\f* 
\v 12  Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the \nd LORD\nd*,
since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness
unto my father’s house, and give me a true token: 
\v 13 And \add that\add* ye will save alive my father, and my mother,
and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
our lives from death. 
\v 14  And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter
not this our business. And it shall be, when the \nd LORD\nd* hath
given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.\f + \fr 2.14 
\ft for…: Heb. instead of you to die\f* 
\v 15  Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
house \add was\add* upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
\v 16  And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the
pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 
\v 17  And the men said unto her, We \add will be\add* blameless
of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear. 
\v 18 Behold, \add when\add* we come into the land, thou shalt bind
this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren,
and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.\f + \fr 2.18  \ft bring: Heb.
gather\f* 
\v 19 And it shall be, \add that\add* whosoever shall go out of the
doors of thy house into the street, his blood \add shall be\add*
upon his head, and we \add will be\add* guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the
house, his blood \add shall be\add* on our head, if \add any\add*
hand be upon him. 
\v 20  And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit
of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
\v 21  And she said, According unto your words, so \add be\add* it. And she sent them
away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\p
\v 22  And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought
\add them\add* throughout all the way, but found \add them\add* not.
\p
\v 23 ¶ So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain,
and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all
\add things\add* that befell them: 
\v 24  And they said unto Joshua, Truly the \nd LORD\nd* hath delivered
into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
country do faint because of us.\f + \fr 2.24  \ft faint: Heb. melt\f*
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and
lodged there before they passed over. 
\v 2  And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
through the host; 
\v 3  And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark
of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and the priests the
Levites bearing  it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go
after it. 
\v 4  Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way
by which ye must go: for ye have not passed \add this\add* way heretofore.\f + \fr 3.4 
\ft heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, and the third day\f* 
\v 5  And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
morrow the \nd LORD\nd* will do wonders among you. 
\v 6  And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark
of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up
the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, This day will I begin
to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with
Moses, \add so\add* I will be with thee. 
\v 8  And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan,
ye shall stand still in Jordan. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither,
and hear the words of the \nd LORD\nd* your God. 
\v 10  And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God
\add is\add* among you, and \add that\add* he will without fail drive
out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites,
and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
Jebusites. 
\v 11  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
passeth over before you into Jordan. 
\v 12  Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
out of every tribe a man. 
\v 13  And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet
of the priests that bear the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, the Lord of all the
earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, \add that\add* the waters
of Jordan shall be cut off \add from\add* the waters that come down
from above; and they shall stand upon an heap. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
before the people; 
\v 15  And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the
water, (for Jordan overfloweth  all his banks all the time of harvest,)
\v 16  That the waters which came down from above stood \add and\add*
rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that \add is\add*
beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
\add even\add* the salt sea, failed, \add and\add* were cut off:
and the people passed over right against Jericho. 
\v 17  And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*
stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites
passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean
over Jordan. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
over Jordan, that the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Joshua, saying, 
\v 2  Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
man, 
\v 3  And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve
stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging
place, where ye shall lodge this night. 
\v 4  Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
\v 5  And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
\nd LORD\nd* your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every
man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the
tribes of the children of Israel: 
\v 6  That this may be a sign among you, \add that\add* when your
children ask \add their fathers\add* in time to come, saying, What
\add mean\add* ye by these stones?\f + \fr 4.6  \ft in time…: Heb. to
morrow\f* 
\v 7  Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
off before the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*; when it passed
over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones
shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. 
\v 8  And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took
up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the \nd LORD\nd*
spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children
of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they
lodged, and laid them down there. 
\v 9  And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the
feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this
day. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
Jordan, until every thing was finished that the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded
 Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over. 
\v 11  And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
over, that the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* passed over, and the priests,
in the presence of the people. 
\v 12  And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,
as Moses spake unto them: 
\v 13  About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
\nd LORD\nd* unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.\f + \fr 4.13 
\ft prepared: or, ready armed\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ On that day the \nd LORD\nd* magnified Joshua in the sight
of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
days of his life. 
\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Joshua, saying, 
\v 16  Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come
up out of Jordan. 
\v 17  Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up
out of Jordan. 
\v 18  And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
\add and\add* the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry
land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed
over all his banks, as \add they did\add* before.\f + \fr 4.18  \ft lifted…: Heb. plucked
up\f*\f + \fr 4.18  \ft flowed: Heb. went\f* 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth \add day\add*
of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
Jericho. 
\p
\v 20  And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
Joshua pitch in Gilgal. 
\v 21  And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What \add mean\add*
these stones?\f + \fr 4.21  \ft in time…: Heb. to morrow\f* 
\v 22  Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came
over this Jordan on dry land. 
\v 23  For the \nd LORD\nd* your God dried up the waters of Jordan
from before you, until ye were passed over, as the \nd LORD\nd* your
God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone
over: 
\v 24  That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
\nd LORD\nd*, that it \add is\add* mighty: that ye might fear the
\nd LORD\nd* your God for ever.\f + \fr 4.24  \ft for ever: Heb. all
days\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
\add were\add* on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings
of the Canaanites, which \add were\add* by the sea, heard that the
\nd LORD\nd* had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children
of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there
spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ At that time the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, Make thee
sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
time.\f + \fr 5.2  \ft sharp…: or, knives of flints\f* 
\v 3  And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.\f + \fr 5.3  \ft sharp…: or, knives of
flints\f*\f + \fr 5.3  \ft the hill…: or, Gibeah-haaraloth\f* 
\v 4 And this \add is\add* the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
people that came out of Egypt, \add that were\add* males, \add even\add*
all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
out of Egypt. 
\v 5  Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
people \add that were\add* born in the wilderness by the way as they came
forth out of Egypt, \add them\add* they had not circumcised. 
\v 6  For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
till all the people \add that were\add* men of war, which came out
of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the
\nd LORD\nd*: unto whom the \nd LORD\nd* sware that he would not
shew them the land, which the \nd LORD\nd* sware unto their fathers
that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
\v 7  And their children, \add whom\add* he raised up in their stead, them
Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
circumcised them by the way. 
\v 8  And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were
whole.\f + \fr 5.8  \ft they had…: Heb. the people had made an end to be
circumcised\f* 
\v 9  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled
away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
place is called Gilgal unto this day.\f + \fr 5.9  \ft Gilgal: that is
Rolling\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains
of Jericho. 
\v 11  And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched \add corn\add*
in the selfsame day. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old
corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did
eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his
sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him,
\add Art\add* thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
\v 14  And he said, Nay; but \add as\add* captain of the host of the
\nd LORD\nd* am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth,
and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?\f + \fr 5.14 
\ft captain: or, prince\f* 
\v 15  And the captain of the \nd LORD’s\nd* host said unto Joshua,
Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest
\add is\add* holy. And Joshua did so. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
Israel: none went out, and none came in.\f + \fr 6.1  \ft was…: Heb. did shut up, and was shut
up\f* 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
hand Jericho, and the king thereof, \add and\add* the mighty men
of valour. 
\v 3  And ye shall compass the city, all \add ye\add* men of war,
\add and\add* go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six
days. 
\v 4  And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets
of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven
times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 
\v 5  And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long \add blast\add*
with the ram’s horn, \add and\add* when ye hear the sound of the
trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall
of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up
every man straight before him.\f + \fr 6.5  \ft flat: Heb. under
it\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take
up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets
of rams’ horns before the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 7  And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns
passed on before the \nd LORD\nd*, and blew with the trumpets: and the
ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* followed them. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, \add the priests\add*
going on, and blowing with the trumpets.\f + \fr 6.9  \ft rereward: Heb. gathering
host\f* 
\v 10  And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall \add any\add*
word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye
shout.\f + \fr 6.10  \ft any noise…: Heb. your voice to be heard\f*
\v 11  So the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* compassed the city, going about
\add it\add* once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the
camp. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took
up the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before
the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* went on continually, and blew with the
trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came
after the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add the priests\add* going on,
and blowing with the trumpets. 
\v 14  And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
into the camp: so they did six days. 
\v 15  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same
manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven
times. 
\v 16  And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests
blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
\nd LORD\nd* hath given you the city. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the city shall be accursed, \add even\add* it, and all that
\add are\add* therein, to the \nd LORD\nd*: only Rahab the harlot
shall live, she and all that \add are\add* with her in the house,
because she hid the messengers that we sent.\f + \fr 6.17  \ft accursed: or,
devoted\f* 
\v 18  And ye, in any wise keep \add yourselves\add* from the accursed
thing, lest ye make \add yourselves\add* accursed, when ye take of the accursed
thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.\f + \fr 6.18 
\ft accursed: or, devoted\f*\f + \fr 6.18  \ft a curse: or, devoted\f*
\v 19  But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
\add are\add* consecrated unto the \nd LORD\nd*: they shall come
into the treasury of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 6.19  \ft consecrated: Heb.
holiness\f* 
\v 20  So the people shouted when \add the priests\add* blew with the
trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall
fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man
straight before him, and they took the city.\f + \fr 6.20  \ft flat: Heb. under
it\f* 
\v 21  And they utterly destroyed all that \add was\add* in the city,
both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
edge of the sword. 
\v 22  But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman,
and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. 
\v 23  And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought
out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.\f + \fr 6.23 
\ft kindred: Heb. families\f* 
\v 24  And they burnt the city with fire, and all that \add was\add*
therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass
and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 25  And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s
household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel \add even\add*
unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent
to spy out Jericho. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And Joshua adjured \add them\add* at that time, saying, Cursed
\add be\add* the man before the \nd LORD\nd*, that riseth up and
buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his
firstborn, and in his youngest \add son\add* shall he set up the
gates of it. 
\v 27  So the \nd LORD\nd* was with Joshua; and his fame was \add noised\add*
throughout all the country. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed

Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the
anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against the children of Israel.\f + \fr 7.1 
\ft Achan: also called, Achar\f*\f + \fr 7.1  \ft Zabdi: also called,
Zimri\f* 
\v 2  And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which \add is\add*
beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them,
saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed
Ai. 
\v 3  And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
Ai; \add and\add* make not all the people to labour thither; for they
\add are but\add* few.\f + \fr 7.3  \ft about…: Heb. about two thousand men, or, about three thousand
men\f* 
\v 4  So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
men: and they fled before the men of Ai. 
\v 5  And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
chased them \add from\add* before the gate \add even\add* unto Shebarim,
and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people
melted, and became as water.\f + \fr 7.5  \ft in…: or, in Morad\f*
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
face before the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* until the eventide, he and the
elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 
\v 7  And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord \nd GOD\nd*, wherefore hast thou at
all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content,
and dwelt on the other side Jordan! 
\v 8  O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before
their enemies!\f + \fr 7.8  \ft backs: Heb. necks\f* 
\v 9  For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
hear \add of it\add*, and shall environ us round, and cut off our
name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore
liest thou thus upon thy face?\f + \fr 7.10  \ft liest: Heb. fallest\f*
\v 11  Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant
which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed
thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put
\add it\add* even among their own stuff. 
\v 12  Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
enemies, \add but\add* turned \add their\add* backs before their
enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any
more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. 
\v 13  Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow: for thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, \add There
is\add* an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst
not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing
from among you. 
\v 14  In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
tribes: and it shall be, \add that\add* the tribe which the \nd LORD\nd*
taketh shall come according to the families \add thereof;\add* and the
family which the \nd LORD\nd* shall take shall come by households;
and the household which the \nd LORD\nd* shall take shall come man
by man. 
\v 15 And it shall be, \add that\add* he that is taken with the accursed
thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath
transgressed the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and because he hath
wrought folly in Israel.\f + \fr 7.15  \ft folly: or, wickedness\f*
\p
\v 16 ¶ So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 
\v 17  And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family
of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
man; and Zabdi was taken: 
\v 18  And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son
of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,
was taken. 
\v 19  And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
to the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
tell me now what thou hast done; hide \add it\add* not from me. 
\v 20  And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
against the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, and thus and thus have I
done: 
\v 21  When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two
hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight,
then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they \add are\add*
hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.\f + \fr 7.21 
\ft wedge: Heb. tongue\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold,
\add it was\add* hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 
\v 23  And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them
out before the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 7.23  \ft laid: Heb. poured\f*
\v 24  And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his
sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep,
and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the
valley of Achor. 
\v 25  And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the \nd LORD\nd*
shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
\v 26  And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this
day. So the \nd LORD\nd* turned from the fierceness of his anger.
Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor,
unto this day.\f + \fr 7.26  \ft Achor: that is, Trouble\f* 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up
to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people,
and his city, and his land: 
\v 2  And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho
and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a
prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
\p
\v 3 ¶ So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them
away by night. 
\v 4  And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
against the city, \add even\add* behind the city: go not very far
from the city, but be ye all ready: 
\v 5  And I, and all the people that \add are\add* with me, will
approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come
out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 
\v 6 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the
city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will
flee before them.\f + \fr 8.6  \ft drawn: Heb. pulled\f* 
\v 7  Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:
for the \nd LORD\nd* your God will deliver it into your hand. 
\v 8  And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, \add that\add*
ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the
\nd LORD\nd* shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai:
but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
\v 10  And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people
to Ai. 
\v 11  And all the people, \add even the people\add* of war that
\add were\add* with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the
city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now \add there was\add*
a valley between them and Ai. 
\v 12  And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.\f + \fr 8.12 
\ft of…: or, of Ai\f* 
\v 13  And when they had set the people, \add even\add* all the host that
\add was\add* on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the
west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.\f + \fr 8.13 
\ft liers…: Heb. lying in wait\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw \add it\add*,
that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went
out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed,
before the plain; but he wist not that \add there were\add* liers in
ambush against him behind the city. 
\v 15  And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 
\v 16  And all the people that \add were\add* in Ai were called together to
pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn
away from the city. 
\v 17  And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not
out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after
Israel. 
\v 18  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that
\add is\add* in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine
hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that \add he had\add* in his
hand toward the city. 
\v 19  And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they
ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the
city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 
\v 20  And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the
smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to
flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness
turned back upon the pursuers.\f + \fr 8.20  \ft power: Heb. hand\f*
\v 21  And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned
again, and slew the men of Ai. 
\v 22  And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the
midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they
smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
\p
\v 23  And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\v 24  And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they
chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,
until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,
and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
\v 25 And \add so\add* it was, \add that\add* all that fell that
day, both of men and women, \add were\add* twelve thousand, \add even\add*
all the men of Ai. 
\v 26  For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched
out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
of Ai. 
\v 27  Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
which he commanded Joshua. 
\v 28  And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, \add even\add*
a desolation unto this day. 
\v 29  And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the
sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase
down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the
city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, \add that remaineth\add*
unto this day. 
\p
\v 30 ¶ Then Joshua built an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel
in mount Ebal, 
\v 31  As Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* commanded the children
of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar
of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up \add any\add* iron:
and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and
sacrificed peace offerings. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
\v 33  And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests
the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*,
as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them
over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal;
as Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded before, that they should
bless the people of Israel. 
\v 34  And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the
law. 
\v 35  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little
ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.\f + \fr 8.35 
\ft were…: Heb. walked\f* 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when all the kings which \add were\add*
on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the
Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
heard \add thereof;\add* 
\v 2  That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
and with Israel, with one accord.\f + \fr 9.2  \ft accord: Heb. mouth\f*
\p
\v 3 ¶ And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
unto Jericho and to Ai, 
\v 4  They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles,
old, and rent, and bound up; 
\v 5  And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry \add and\add*
mouldy. 
\v 6  And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the
men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make
ye a league with us. 
\v 7  And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? 
\v 8  And they said unto Joshua, We \add are\add* thy servants. And
Joshua said unto them, Who \add are\add* ye? and from whence come ye?
\v 9  And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
are come because of the name of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God: for we have
heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, 
\v 10  And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
\add were\add* beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og
king of Bashan, which \add was\add* at Ashtaroth. 
\v 11  Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and
go to meet them, and say unto them, We \add are\add* your servants:
therefore now make ye a league with us.\f + \fr 9.11  \ft with you: Heb. in your

\v 12  This our bread we took hot \add for\add* our provision out of our

\v 13  And these bottles of wine, which we filled, \add were\add*
new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes
are become old by reason of the very long journey. 
\v 14  And the men took of their victuals, and asked not \add counsel\add*
at the mouth of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 9.14  \ft the men…: or, they received the men by reason of their
victuals\f* 
\p
\v 15  And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them
live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
made a league with them, that they heard that they \add were\add*
their neighbours, and \add that\add* they dwelt among them. 
\v 17  And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
cities on the third day. Now their cities \add were\add* Gibeon,
and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim. 
\v 18  And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
of the congregation had sworn unto them by the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 
\v 19  But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
sworn unto them by the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel: now therefore we
may not touch them. 
\v 20  This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 
\v 21  And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the
princes had promised them. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We \add are\add* very far
from you; when ye dwell among us? 
\v 23 Now therefore ye \add are\add* cursed, and there shall none of you be
freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the house of my God.\f + \fr 9.23  \ft none…: Heb. not be cut off from

\v 24  And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
told thy servants, how that the \nd LORD\nd* thy God commanded  his
servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants
of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our
lives because of you, and have done this thing. 
\v 25  And now, behold, we \add are\add* in thine hand: as it seemeth
good and right unto thee to do unto us, do. 
\v 26  And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand
of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 
\v 27  And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
water for the congregation, and for the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*,
even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.\f + \fr 9.27 
\ft made: Heb. gave, or, delivered to be\f* 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had
heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had
done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king;
and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were
among them; 
\v 2  That they feared greatly, because Gibeon \add was\add* a great
city, as one of the royal cities, and because it \add was\add* greater
than Ai, and all the men thereof \add were\add* mighty.\f + \fr 10.2 
\ft royal…: Heb. cities of the kingdom\f* 
\v 3  Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king
of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of
Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
\v 4  Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made
peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
\v 5  Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the
king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their
hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,
and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that
dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us. 
\p
\v 7  So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
with him, and all the mighty men of valour. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand
before thee. 
\v 9  Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, \add and\add* went
up from Gilgal all night. 
\v 10  And the \nd LORD\nd* discomfited  them before Israel, and
slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto
Makkedah. 
\v 11  And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, \add and\add*
were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the \nd LORD\nd* cast
down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died:
\add they were\add* more which died with hailstones than \add they\add*
whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then spake Joshua to the \nd LORD\nd* in the day when the
\nd LORD\nd* delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel,
and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.\f + \fr 10.12  \ft stand…: Heb. be

\v 13  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
had avenged themselves upon their enemies. \add Is\add* not this
written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst
of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.\f + \fr 10.13 
\ft Jasher: or, the upright?\f* 
\v 14  And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
\nd LORD\nd* hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the \nd LORD\nd*
fought for Israel. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp
to Gilgal. 
\v 16  But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
Makkedah. 
\v 17  And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
in a cave at Makkedah. 
\v 18  And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
and set men by it for to keep them: 
\v 19  And stay ye not, \add but\add* pursue after your enemies,
and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their
cities: for the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath delivered them into your
hand.\f + \fr 10.19  \ft smite…: Heb. cut off the tail\f* 
\v 20  And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were
consumed, that the rest \add which\add* remained of them entered
into fenced cities. 
\v 21  And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
\v 22  Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
those five kings unto me out of the cave. 
\v 23  And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the
cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth,
the king of Lachish, \add and\add* the king of Eglon. 
\v 24  And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
Joshua, that Joshua called  for all the men of Israel, and said unto the
captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your
feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their
feet upon the necks of them. 
\v 25  And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
and of good courage: for thus shall the \nd LORD\nd* do to all your
enemies against whom ye fight. 
\v 26  And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the
evening. 
\v 27  And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
\add that\add* Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the
trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, \add which remain\add* until this
very day. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the
edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the
souls that \add were\add* therein; he let none remain: and he did
to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho. 
\v 29  Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 
\v 30  And the \nd LORD\nd* delivered  it also, and the king thereof, into the
hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
souls that \add were\add* therein; he let none remain in it; but
did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 
\v 32  And the \nd LORD\nd* delivered  Lachish into the hand of Israel,
which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
sword, and all the souls that \add were\add* therein, according to all that he had
done to Libnah. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. 
\p
\v 34 ¶ And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel
with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 
\v 35  And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the
sword, and all the souls that \add were\add* therein he utterly destroyed
that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. 
\v 36  And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
Hebron; and they fought against it: 
\v 37  And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that
\add were\add* therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had
done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that \add were\add* therein.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
fought against it: 
\v 39  And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they
smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the
souls that \add were\add* therein; he left none remaining: as he had
done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had
done also to Libnah, and to her king. 
\p
\v 40 ¶ So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings:
he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed,
as the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel commanded. 
\v 41  And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the
country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 
\v 42  And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
time, because the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel fought for Israel. 
\v 43  And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp
to Gilgal. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard \add those
things\add*, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
\v 2  And to the kings that \add were\add* on the north of the mountains,
and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the
borders of Dor on the west, 
\v 3  \add And to\add* the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and
\add to\add* the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
Jebusite in the mountains, and \add to\add* the Hivite under Hermon
in the land of Mizpeh. 
\v 4  And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
people, even as the sand that \add is\add* upon the sea shore in
multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 
\v 5  And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\f + \fr 11.5 
\ft met…: Heb. assembled by appointment\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because
of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all
slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
chariots with fire. 
\v 7  So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the
waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. 
\v 8  And the \nd LORD\nd* delivered  them into the hand of Israel,
who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim,
and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they
left them none remaining.\f + \fr 11.8  \ft great Zidon: or, Zidonrabbah\f*\f + \fr 11.8 
\ft Misrephoth-maim: or, Salt pits: Heb. Burnings of waters\f* 
\v 9  And Joshua did unto them as the \nd LORD\nd* bade him: he houghed
their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and
smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
head of all those kingdoms. 
\v 11  And they smote all the souls that \add were\add* therein with the
edge of the sword, utterly destroying \add them:\add* there was not any
left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.\f + \fr 11.11  \ft any…: Heb. any
breath\f* 
\v 12  And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did
Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, \add and\add*
he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded. 
\v 13 But \add as for\add* the cities that stood still in their strength,
Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; \add that\add* did Joshua
burn.\f + \fr 11.13  \ft in their…: Heb. on their heap\f* 
\v 14  And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children
of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote
with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither
left they any to breathe. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ As the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  Moses his servant, so did
Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the
\nd LORD\nd* commanded  Moses.\f + \fr 11.15  \ft left…: Heb. removed
nothing\f* 
\v 16  So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,
and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 
\v 17  \add Even\add* from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir,
even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their
kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.\f + \fr 11.17  \ft the mount…: or, the smooth
mountain\f* 
\v 18  Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 
\v 19  There was not a city that made peace with the children of
Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all \add other\add*
they took in battle. 
\v 20  For it was of the \nd LORD\nd* to harden their hearts, that they should come
against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, \add and\add*
that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the
\nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains
of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them
utterly with their cities. 
\v 22  There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
\v 23  So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the \nd LORD\nd*
said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel
according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested
from war. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the kings of the land, which the children
of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan
toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon,
and all the plain on the east: 
\v 2  Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, \add and\add*
ruled from Aroer, which \add is\add* upon the bank of the river Arnon,
and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the
river Jabbok, \add which is\add* the border of the children of Ammon;
\v 3  And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the

unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half
Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
\v 6  Them did Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* and the children
of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* gave it
\add for\add* a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and the half tribe of Manasseh. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And these \add are\add* the kings of the country which Joshua
and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west,
from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel
\add for\add* a possession according to their divisions; 
\v 8  In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the
springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites,

\c 13  
\p
\v 1  Now Joshua was old \add and\add* stricken in years; and the
\nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Thou art old \add and\add* stricken in
years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.\f + \fr 13.1 
\ft to…: Heb. to possess it\f* 
\v 2 This \add is\add* the land that yet remaineth: all the borders
of the Philistines, and all Geshuri, 
\v 3  From Sihor, which \add is\add* before Egypt, even unto the
borders of Ekron northward, \add which\add* is counted to the Canaanite:
five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites,
the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
\v 4  From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that

Amorites:\f + \fr 13.4  \ft Mearah: or, the cave\f* 
\v 5  And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising,

\v 6  All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim,
\add and\add* all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before
the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites
for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. 
\p
\v 7  Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 
\v 8  With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, \add even\add*
as Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* gave them; 
\v 9  From Aroer, that \add is\add* upon the bank of the river Arnon,
and the city that \add is\add* in the midst of the river, and all the
plain of Medeba unto Dibon; 
\v 10  And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned
in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; 
\v 11  And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 
\v 12  All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did
Moses smite, and cast them out. 
\v 13  Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,
nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell
among the Israelites until this day. 
\v 14  Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
sacrifices of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel made by fire \add are\add*
their inheritance, as he said unto them. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben \add inheritance\add*
according to their families. 
\v 16  And their coast was from Aroer, that \add is\add* on the bank
of the river Arnon, and the city that \add is\add* in the midst of the
river, and all the plain by Medeba; 
\v 17  Heshbon, and all her cities that \add are\add* in the plain;

\v 21  And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote
with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
Reba, \add which were\add* dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.\f + \fr 13.22

\v 23  And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
border \add thereof\add*. This \add was\add* the inheritance of the
children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
\v 24  And Moses gave \add inheritance\add* unto the tribe of Gad,
\add even\add* unto the children of Gad according to their families.
\v 25  And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that \add is\add*
before Rabbah; 
\v 26  And from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from
Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 
\v 27  And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth,
and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and
\add his\add* border, \add even\add* unto the edge of the sea of
Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward. 
\v 28 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
families, the cities, and their villages. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And Moses gave \add inheritance\add* unto the half tribe
of Manasseh: and \add this\add* was \add the possession\add* of the
half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families. 
\v 30  And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which \add are\add*
in Bashan, threescore cities: 
\v 31  And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom
of Og in Bashan, \add were pertaining\add* unto the children of Machir
the son of Manasseh, \add even\add* to the one half of the children
of Machir by their families. 
\v 32 These \add are the countries\add* which Moses did distribute for
inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho,
eastward. 
\v 33  But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not \add any\add* inheritance:
the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel \add was\add* their inheritance, as he
said unto them. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 And these \add are the countries\add* which the children of
Israel inherited  in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes
of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them. 
\v 2  By lot \add was\add* their inheritance, as the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and \add for\add*
the half tribe. 
\v 3  For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none
inheritance among them. 
\v 4  For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities
to dwell \add in\add*, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their
substance. 
\v 5  As the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  Moses, so the children of Israel
did, and they divided the land. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest
the thing that the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses the man of God concerning
me and thee in Kadesh-barnea. 
\v 7  Forty years old \add was\add* I when Moses the servant of the
\nd LORD\nd* sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I
brought him word again as \add it was\add* in mine heart. 
\v 8  Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
of the people melt: but I wholly followed the \nd LORD\nd* my God.
\v 9  And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy
feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s
for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the \nd LORD\nd* my God.
\v 10  And now, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath kept me alive, as he
said, these forty and five years, even since the \nd LORD\nd* spake
this word unto Moses, while \add the children of\add* Israel wandered
in the wilderness: and now, lo, I \add am\add* this day fourscore
and five years old.\f + \fr 14.10  \ft wandered: Heb. walked\f* 
\v 11 As yet I \add am as\add* strong this day as \add I was\add*
in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength \add was\add* then, even so
\add is\add* my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come
in. 
\v 12  Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the \nd LORD\nd*
spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims
\add were\add* there, and \add that\add* the cities \add were\add*
great \add and\add* fenced: if so be the \nd LORD\nd* \add will be\add*
with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the \nd LORD\nd*
said. 
\v 13  And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Hebron for an inheritance. 
\v 14  Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed
the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 15  And the name of Hebron before \add was\add* Kirjath-arba;
\add which Arba was\add* a great man among the Anakims. And the land
had rest from war. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  \add This\add* then was the lot of the tribe of the children
of Judah by their families; \add even\add* to the border of Edom
the wilderness of Zin southward \add was\add* the uttermost part
of the south coast. 
\v 2  And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
from the bay that looketh southward:\f + \fr 15.2  \ft bay: Heb.

\v 3  And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed
along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea,
and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass

\v 4  \add From thence\add* it passed toward Azmon, and went out

\add was\add* from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
\v 6  And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the
north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan
the son of Reuben: 
\v 7  And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that \add is\add* before
the going up to Adummim, which \add is\add* on the south side of the
river: and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings
out thereof were at En-rogel: 
\v 8  And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
south side of the Jebusite; the same \add is\add* Jerusalem: and the
border went up to the top of the mountain that \add lieth\add* before
the valley of Hinnom westward, which \add is\add* at the end of the
valley of the giants northward: 
\v 9  And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of
mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which \add is\add*
Kirjath-jearim: 
\v 10  And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which \add is\add*

on to Timnah: 
\v 11  And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward:
and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah,
and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the

\v 12  And the west border \add was\add* to the great sea, and the

of Judah round about according to their families. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among

\v 17  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he
gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
\v 18  And it came to pass, as she came \add unto him\add*, that she
moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off \add her\add*

\v 19  Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a

\v 20 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the tribe of the children

children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho,
unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth
up from Jericho throughout mount Beth-el,\f + \fr 16.1  \ft fell: Heb. went
forth\f* 
\v 2  And goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and passeth along unto the
borders of Archi to Ataroth, 
\v 3  And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out
thereof are at the sea. 
\v 4  So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
inheritance. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
families was \add thus:\add* even the border of their inheritance
on the east side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper; 
\v 6  And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north
side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and
passed by it on the east to Janohah; 
\v 7  And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. 
\v 8  The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This \add is\add* the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
\v 9  And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim \add were\add*
among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
with their villages. 
\v 10  And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer:
but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
serve under tribute. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he \add was\add*
the firstborn of Joseph; \add to wit\add*, for Machir the firstborn
of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had
Gilead and Bashan. 
\v 2 There was also \add a lot\add* for the rest of the children
of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children
of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children
of Shemida: these \add were\add* the male children of Manasseh the
son of Joseph by their families.\f + \fr 17.2  \ft Abiezer: also called,
Jeezer\f* 
\p
\v 3 ¶ But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the
son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these
\add are\add* the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah,
Milcah, and Tirzah. 
\v 4  And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The \nd LORD\nd*
commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the
commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* he gave them an inheritance among
the brethren of their father. 
\v 5  And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
Gilead and Bashan, which \add were\add* on the other side Jordan;
\v 6  Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among
his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
\add lieth\add* before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
\v 8  \add Now\add* Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah
on the border of Manasseh \add belonged\add* to the children of Ephraim;
\v 9  And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
river: these cities of Ephraim \add are\add* among the cities of
Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also \add was\add* on the north side
of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:\f + \fr 17.9 
\ft river Kanah: or, brook of reeds\f* 
\v 10  Southward \add it was\add* Ephraim’s, and northward \add it
was\add* Manasseh’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together
in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east. 
\v 11  And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her
towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns, \add even\add* three countries. 
\v 12  Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out \add the inhabitants
of\add* those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\v 13  Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly
drive them out. 
\p
\v 14  And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou
given me \add but\add* one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
\add am\add* a great people, forasmuch as the \nd LORD\nd* hath blessed
me hitherto? 
\v 15  And Joshua answered them, If thou \add be\add* a great people,
\add then\add* get thee up to the wood \add country\add*, and cut
down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants,
if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.\f + \fr 17.15  \ft giants: or,
Rephaims\f* 
\v 16  And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the
Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of
iron, \add both they\add* who \add are\add* of Beth-shean and her
towns, and \add they\add* who \add are\add* of the valley of Jezreel.
\v 17  And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, \add even\add*
to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou \add art\add* a great people,
and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot \add only:\add*
\v 18  But the mountain shall be thine; for it \add is\add* a wood,
and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive
out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, \add and\add* though they
\add be\add* strong. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation
there. And the land was subdued before them. 
\p
\v 2  And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
which had not yet received their inheritance. 
\v 3  And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long \add are\add*
ye slack to go to possess the land, which the \nd LORD\nd* God of your
fathers hath given you? 
\v 4  Give out from among you three men for \add each\add* tribe:
and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land,
and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall
come \add again\add* to me. 
\v 5  And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide
in their coasts on the north. 
\v 6  Ye shall therefore describe the land \add into\add* seven parts,
and bring \add the description\add* hither to me, that I may cast
lots for you here before the \nd LORD\nd* our God. 
\v 7  But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood
of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* their inheritance: and Gad, and
Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance
beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*
gave them. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,
and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots
for you before the \nd LORD\nd* in Shiloh. 
\v 9  And the men went and passed through the land, and described
it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came \add again\add*
to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the \nd LORD\nd*:
and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their
divisions. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came
up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth
between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
\v 12  And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went
up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the
wilderness of Beth-aven. 
\v 13  And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
of Luz, which \add is\add* Beth-el, southward; and the border descended
to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that \add lieth\add* on the south

\v 14  And the border was drawn \add thence\add*, and compassed the

Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which
\add is\add* Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
\add was\add* the west quarter. 
\v 15  And the south quarter \add was\add* from the end of Kirjath-jearim,
and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
waters of Nephtoah: 
\v 16  And the border came down to the end of the mountain that \add lieth\add*
before the valley of the son of Hinnom, \add and\add* which \add is\add*
in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,
\v 17  And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh,
and went forth toward Geliloth, which \add is\add* over against the going
up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
\v 18  And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward,
and went down unto Arabah:\f + \fr 18.18  \ft Arabah: or, the plain\f*
\v 19  And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward:

sea at the south end of Jordan: this \add was\add* the south coast.\f + \fr 18.19

\v 20  And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This \add was\add*
the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round
about, according to their families. 
\v 21  Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their
families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
\v 22  And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el, 
\v 23  And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, 
\v 24  And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities

\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And the second lot came forth to Simeon, \add even\add* for the

inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families. 
\v 9  Out of the portion of the children of Judah \add was\add* the
inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children
of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon
had their inheritance within the inheritance of them. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their
families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid: 
\v 11  And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that \add is\add*
before Jokneam; 
\v 12  And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the

\v 23 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the tribe of the children
of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.

\v 33  And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim,

\v 48 This \add is\add* the inheritance of the tribe of the children

\p
\v 49 ¶ When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua
the son of Nun among them: 
\v 50  According to the word of the \nd LORD\nd* they gave him the

and he built the city, and dwelt therein. 
\v 51 These \add are\add* the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest,
and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes
of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh
before the \nd LORD\nd*, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
So they made an end of dividing the country. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  The \nd LORD\nd* also spake unto Joshua, saying,

cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:
\v 3  That the slayer that killeth \add any\add* person unawares
\add and\add* unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your
refuge from the avenger of blood. 
\v 4  And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand
at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause
in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the
city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
\v 5  And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime. 
\v 6  And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
congregation for judgment, \add and\add* until the death of the high
priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return,
and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city
from whence he fled.

\c 21  
\p
\v 1  Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the
heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
\v 2  And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying,
The \nd LORD\nd* commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities
to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle. 
\v 3  And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
inheritance, at the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*, these cities

suburbs. 
\v 42  These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus
\add were\add* all these cities. 
\p
\v 43 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* gave unto Israel all the land which he
sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
\v 44  And the \nd LORD\nd* gave them rest round about, according to all that he
sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their
enemies before them; the \nd LORD\nd* delivered all their enemies
into their hand. 
\v 45  There failed not ought of any good thing which the \nd LORD\nd*
had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1  Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
half tribe of Manasseh, 
\v 2  And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant
of the \nd LORD\nd* commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
commanded you: 
\v 3  Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
but have kept the charge of the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* your
God. 
\v 4  And now the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath given rest unto your
brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your
tents, \add and\add* unto the land of your possession, which Moses
the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* gave you on the other side Jordan.
\v 5  But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which
Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* charged you, to love the \nd LORD\nd*
your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your
soul. 
\v 6  So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their
tents. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now to the \add one\add* half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses
had given \add possession\add* in Bashan: but unto the \add other\add*
half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan
westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
blessed them, 
\v 8  And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your
tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with
brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil
of your enemies with your brethren. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of
Israel out of Shiloh, which \add is\add* in the land of Canaan, to
go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were
possessed, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd* by the hand
of Moses. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that \add are\add*
in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of
Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
a great altar to see to. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children
of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders
of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. 
\v 12  And when the children of Israel heard \add of it\add*, the whole
congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together
at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. 
\v 13  And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the
land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 
\v 14  And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the
tribes of Israel; and each one \add was\add* an head of the house
of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.\f + \fr 22.14  \ft chief…: Heb. house of the
father\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,
and they spake with them, saying, 
\v 16  Thus saith the whole congregation of the \nd LORD\nd*, What
trespass \add is\add* this that ye have committed against the God
of Israel, to turn away this day from following the \nd LORD\nd*,
in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day
against the \nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 17  \add Is\add* the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not
cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation
of the \nd LORD\nd*, 
\v 18  But that ye must turn away this day from following the \nd LORD\nd*? and it will be,
\add seeing\add* ye rebel to day against the \nd LORD\nd*, that to
morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 
\v 19  Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession \add be\add*
unclean, \add then\add* pass ye over unto the land of the possession
of the \nd LORD\nd*, wherein the \nd LORD’s\nd* tabernacle dwelleth,
and take possession among us: but rebel not against the \nd LORD\nd*,
nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the
\nd LORD\nd* our God. 
\v 20  Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that
man perished  not alone in his iniquity. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands
of Israel, 
\v 22  The \nd LORD\nd* God of gods, the \nd LORD\nd* God of gods,
he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if \add it be\add* in rebellion,
or if in transgression against the \nd LORD\nd*, (save us not this
day,) 
\v 23  That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
\nd LORD\nd*, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the \nd LORD\nd* himself
require \add it;\add* 
\v 24 And if we have not \add rather\add* done it for fear of \add this\add*
thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
children, saying, What have ye to do with the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Israel?\f + \fr 22.24  \ft In time…: Heb. To morrow\f* 
\v 25  For the \nd LORD\nd* hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the \nd LORD\nd*:
so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 26  Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 
\v 27 But \add that\add* it \add may be\add* a witness between us, and you, and our
generations after us, that we might do the service of the \nd LORD\nd*
before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace
offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to
come, Ye have no part in the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 28  Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should \add so\add*
say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
\add again\add*, Behold the pattern of the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*,
which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it
\add is\add* a witness between us and you. 
\v 29  God forbid that we should rebel against the \nd LORD\nd*,
and turn this day from following the \nd LORD\nd*, to build an altar
for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
altar of the \nd LORD\nd* our God that \add is\add* before his tabernacle.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation
and heads of the thousands of Israel which \add were\add* with him,
heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.\f + \fr 22.30 
\ft pleased…: Heb. was good in their eyes\f* 
\v 31  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children
of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh,
This day we perceive that the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* among us, because ye have not
committed this trespass against the \nd LORD\nd*: now ye have delivered
the children of Israel out of the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 22.31 
\ft now: Heb. then\f* 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad,
out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children
of Israel, and brought them word again. 
\v 33  And the thing pleased  the children of Israel; and the children
of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in
battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad
dwelt. 
\v 34  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
the altar \add Ed:\add* for it \add shall be\add* a witness between us that the
\nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* God.\f + \fr 22.34  \ft Ed: that is, A

\c 23  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass a long time after that the \nd LORD\nd*
had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
Joshua waxed old \add and\add* stricken in age.\f + \fr 23.1  \ft stricken…: Heb. come into
days\f* 
\v 2  And Joshua called for all Israel, \add and\add* for their elders,
and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
and said unto them, I am old \add and\add* stricken in age: 
\v 3  And ye have seen all that the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath done
unto all these nations because of you; for the \nd LORD\nd* your
God \add is\add* he that hath fought for you. 
\v 4  Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,
to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations
that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.\f + \fr 23.4 
\ft westward: Heb. at the sunset\f* 
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* your God, he shall expel them from before
you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
their land, as the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath promised unto you.
\v 6  Be ye therefore very courageous  to keep and to do all that is
written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom
\add to\add* the right hand or \add to\add* the left; 
\v 7  That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make
mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear \add by them\add*,
neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: 
\v 8  But cleave unto the \nd LORD\nd* your God, as ye have done
unto this day.\f + \fr 23.8  \ft But cleave…: or, For if ye will cleave,
etc\f* 
\v 9  For the \nd LORD\nd* hath driven out from before you great
nations and strong: but \add as for\add* you, no man hath been able to
stand before you unto this day.\f + \fr 23.9  \ft For the \+nd LORD\+nd*…: or, Then the

\v 10  One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the \nd LORD\nd*

\p
\v 11  Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
\nd LORD\nd* your God.\f + \fr 23.11  \ft yourselves: Heb. your souls\f*
\v 12  Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
of these nations, \add even\add* these that remain among you, and shall make
marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 
\v 13  Know for a certainty that the \nd LORD\nd* your God will no
more drive out \add any of\add* these nations from before you; but they shall be
snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns
in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the \nd LORD\nd*
your God hath given you. 
\v 14  And, behold, this day I \add am\add* going the way of all the
earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not
one thing hath failed of all the good things which the \nd LORD\nd*
your God spake  concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, \add and\add*
not one thing hath failed thereof. 
\v 15 Therefore it shall come to pass, \add that\add* as all good
things are come upon you, which the \nd LORD\nd* your God promised
you; so shall the \nd LORD\nd* bring upon you all evil things, until he have
destroyed you from off this good land which the \nd LORD\nd* your
God hath given you. 
\v 16  When ye have transgressed the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*
your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other
gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the \nd LORD\nd*
be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the
good land which he hath given unto you.

\p
\v 1  And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their
judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before
God. 
\v 2  And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
in old time, \add even\add* Terah, the father of Abraham, and the
father of Nachor: and they served other gods. 
\v 3  And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his
seed, and gave him Isaac. 
\v 4  And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into
Egypt. 
\v 5  I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that
which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. 
\v 6  And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and
horsemen unto the Red sea. 
\v 7  And when they cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*, he put darkness
between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and
covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt:
and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. 
\v 8  And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your
hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from
before you. 
\v 9  Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
\v 10  But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed
you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. 
\v 11  And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites,
and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. 
\v 12  And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
before you, \add even\add* the two kings of the Amorites; \add but\add*
not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 
\v 13  And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards
and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Now therefore fear the \nd LORD\nd*, and serve him in sincerity
and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other
side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 15  And if it seem evil unto you to serve the \nd LORD\nd*, choose
you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers
served that \add were\add* on the other side of the flood, or the
gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my
house, we will serve the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
forsake the \nd LORD\nd*, to serve other gods; 
\v 17  For the \nd LORD\nd* our God, he \add it is\add* that brought us
up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the
way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
\v 18  And the \nd LORD\nd* drave out from before us all the people,
even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: \add therefore\add* will we also
serve the \nd LORD\nd*; for he \add is\add* our God. 
\v 19  And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the \nd LORD\nd*: for he
\add is\add* an holy God; he \add is\add* a jealous God; he will not
forgive your transgressions nor your sins.\f + \fr 24.19  \ft holy God: Heb. holy
Gods\f* 
\v 20  If ye forsake the \nd LORD\nd*, and serve strange gods, then he will
turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you
good. 
\v 21  And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  And Joshua said unto the people, Ye \add are\add* witnesses
against yourselves that ye have chosen you the \nd LORD\nd*, to serve
him. And they said, \add We are\add* witnesses. 
\v 23  Now therefore put away, \add said he\add*, the strange gods which
\add are\add* among you, and incline your heart unto the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel. 
\v 24  And the people said unto Joshua, The \nd LORD\nd* our God
will we serve, and his voice will we obey. 
\v 25  So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that \add was\add*
by the sanctuary of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 27  And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a
witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*
which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye
deny your God. 
\v 28  So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
\p
\v 29 ¶ And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son
of Nun, the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*, died, \add being\add* an
hundred and ten years old. 
\v 30  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which
\add is\add* in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
\v 31  And Israel served the \nd LORD\nd* all the days of Joshua,
and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had
known all the works of the \nd LORD\nd*, that he had done for Israel.\f + \fr 24.31

\p
\v 32 ¶ And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which
Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred
pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of
Joseph.\f + \fr 24.32  \ft pieces…: or, lambs\f* 
\v 33  And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a

him in mount Ephraim.
