\v 3  Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name \add is

as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 
\v 6  Look not upon me, because I \add am\add* black, because the
sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they
made me the keeper of the vineyards; \add but\add* mine own vineyard
have I not kept. 
\p
\v 7  Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest
\add thy flock\add* to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth

\v 10  Thy cheeks are comely with rows \add of jewels\add*, thy neck

\v 13  A bundle of myrrh \add is\add* my wellbeloved unto me; he shall
lie all night betwixt my breasts. 
\v 14  My beloved \add is\add* unto me \add as\add* a cluster of

lattice.\f + \fr 2.9  \ft shewing…: Heb. flourishing\f* 
\v 10  My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
one, and come away. 
\v 11  For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over \add and\add*
gone; 
\v 12  The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing \add of
birds\add* is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
\v 13  The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines \add with\add*
the tender grape give a \add good\add* smell. Arise, my love, my fair
one, and come away. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ O my dove, \add that art\add* in the clefts of the rock,
in the secret \add places\add* of the stairs, let me see thy countenance,
let me hear thy voice; for sweet \add is\add* thy voice, and thy
countenance \add is\add* comely. 
\v 15  Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines:
for our vines \add have\add* tender grapes. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ My beloved \add is\add* mine, and I \add am\add* his: he
feedeth among the lilies. 
\v 17  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.\f + \fr 2.17 
\ft of Bether: or, of division\f*

\p
\v 1  By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
him, but I found him not. 
\v 2  I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad
ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
\v 3  The watchmen that go about the city found me: \add to whom I
said\add*, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? 
\v 4  \add It was\add* but a little that I passed from them, but I
found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him
go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the
chamber of her that conceived me. 
\v 5  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and
by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake \add my\add*
love, till he please.

\v 7  Behold his bed, which \add is\add* Solomon’s; threescore valiant men
\add are\add* about it, of the valiant of Israel. 
\v 8  They all hold swords, \add being\add* expert in war: every

\v 10  He made the pillars thereof \add of\add* silver, the bottom thereof
\add of\add* gold, the covering of it \add of\add* purple, the midst

\v 11  Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon
with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

\p
\v 1 Behold, thou \add art\add* fair, my love; behold, thou \add art\add*

\v 8 ¶ Come with me from Lebanon, \add my\add* spouse, with me from
Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain

cypress\f* 
\v 14  Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees
of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: 
\p
\v 15  A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
from Lebanon. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
\add that\add* the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come
into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  I am come into my garden, my sister, \add my\add* spouse: I have
gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my
honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink,
yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.\f + \fr 5.1  \ft yea…: or, and be drunken with

love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, \add and\add*
my locks with the drops of the night. 
\v 3  I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
my feet; how shall I defile them? 
\v 4  My beloved put in his hand by the hole \add of the door\add*,
and my bowels were moved for him.\f + \fr 5.4  \ft for him: or, (as some read) in
me\f* 
\v 5  I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped \add with\add*

\v 6  I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,

find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. 
\v 7  The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote
me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
\v 8  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
that ye tell him, that I \add am\add* sick of love.\f + \fr 5.8 
\ft that ye: Heb. what, etc\f*

\ft overcome…: or, puffed me up\f* 
\v 6  Thy teeth \add are\add* as a flock of sheep which go up from the

thy locks. 
\v 8  There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
virgins without number. 
\v 9  My dove, my undefiled is \add but\add* one; she \add is\add* the
\add only\add* one of her mother, she \add is\add* the choice \add one\add*
of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; \add yea\add*,
the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Who \add is\add* she \add that\add* looketh forth as the
morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, \add and\add* terrible as

\p
\v 11  I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the

\v 8 ¶ We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we
do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
