\mt1 THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JUDE 
\c 1

\v 1  Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are
sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, \add and\add*
called: 
\v 2  Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. 
\p
\v 3  Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort
\add you\add* that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which
was once delivered unto the saints. 
\v 4  For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace
of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and
our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land
of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 
\v 6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under
darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 
\v 7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire. 
\v 8  Likewise also these \add filthy\add* dreamers defile the flesh,
despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. 
\v 9  Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing
accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. 
\v 10  But these speak evil of those things which they know not:
but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt
themselves. 
\v 11  Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and
ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
gainsaying of Core. 
\v 12  These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds \add they are\add*
without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth,
without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 
\v 13  Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. 
\v 14  And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
\v 15  To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard \add speeches\add* which ungodly
sinners have spoken against him. 
\v 16  These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling \add words\add*, having
men’s persons in admiration because of advantage. 
\p
\v 17  But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
\v 18  How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. 
\v 19  These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not
the Spirit. 
\v 20  But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 
\v 21  Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 
\v 22  And of some have compassion, making a difference: 
\v 23  And others save with fear, pulling \add them\add* out of the
fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. 
\p
\v 24  Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
present \add you\add* faultless before the presence of his glory
with exceeding joy, 
\v 25  To the only wise God our Saviour, \add be\add* glory and majesty,
dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
