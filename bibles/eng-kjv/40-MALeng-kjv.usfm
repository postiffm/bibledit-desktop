\v 1  The burden of the word of the \nd LORD\nd* to Israel by Malachi.\f + \fr 1.1 
\ft by…: Heb. by the hand of\f* 
\v 2  I have loved you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
loved us? \add Was\add* not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the \nd LORD\nd*:
yet I loved Jacob, 
\v 3  And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste
for the dragons of the wilderness. 
\v 4  Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return
and build the desolate places; thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts,
They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The
border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the \nd LORD\nd*
hath indignation for ever. 
\v 5  And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The \nd LORD\nd*
will be magnified from the border of Israel.\f + \fr 1.5  \ft from: or, upon: Heb. from
upon\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ A son honoureth \add his\add* father, and a servant his master: if then I
\add be\add* a father, where \add is\add* mine honour? and if I \add be\add*
a master, where \add is\add* my fear? saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts
unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we
despised thy name? 
\v 7  Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we
polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add*
contemptible.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft offer…: or, bring unto, etc\f* 
\v 8  And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, \add is it\add* not
evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, \add is it\add* not evil?
offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or
accept thy person? saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts.\f + \fr 1.8 
\ft for: Heb. to\f* 
\v 9  And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your
means: will he regard your persons? saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts.\f + \fr 1.9 
\ft God: Heb. the face of God\f*\f + \fr 1.9  \ft by…: Heb. from your
hand\f* 
\v 10 Who \add is there\add* even among you that would shut the doors
\add for nought?\add* neither do ye kindle \add fire\add* on mine
altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. 
\v 11  For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my
name \add shall be\add* great among the Gentiles; and in every place
incense \add shall be\add* offered unto my name, and a pure offering:
for my name \add shall be\add* great among the heathen, saith the
\nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the
\nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* polluted; and the fruit thereof, \add even\add*
his meat, \add is\add* contemptible. 
\v 13  Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness \add is it!\add* and ye have
snuffed at it, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; and ye brought \add that which
was\add* torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering:
should I accept this of your hand? saith the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 1.13 
\ft and ye have…: or, whereas ye might have blown it away\f* 
\v 14  But cursed \add be\add* the deceiver, which hath in his flock
a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I
\add am\add* a great King, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, and my
name \add is\add* dreadful among the heathen.\f + \fr 1.14  \ft which…: Heb. in whose flock
is\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And now, O ye priests, this commandment \add is\add* for you.
\v 2  If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay \add it\add* to
heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts,
I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings:
yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay \add it\add*
to heart. 
\v 3  Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
faces, \add even\add* the dung of your solemn feasts; and \add one\add*
shall take you away with it.\f + \fr 2.3  \ft corrupt: or, reprove\f*\f + \fr 2.3 
\ft spread: Heb. scatter\f*\f + \fr 2.3  \ft one…: or, it shall take you away to
it\f* 
\v 4  And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my
covenant might be with Levi, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\v 5  My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him
\add for\add* the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before
my name. 
\v 6  The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn
many away from iniquity. 
\v 7  For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should
seek the law at his mouth: for he \add is\add* the messenger of the
\nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\v 8  But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith
the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft stumble at: or, fall
in\f* 
\v 9  Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the
people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial
in the law.\f + \fr 2.9  \ft have been…: or, lifted up the face against: Heb. accepted
faces\f* 
\p
\v 10  Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal
treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant
of our fathers? 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed
in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness
of the \nd LORD\nd* which he loved, and hath married the daughter
of a strange god.\f + \fr 2.11  \ft loved: or, ought to love\f* 
\v 12  The \nd LORD\nd* will cut off the man that doeth this, the
master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that
offereth an offering unto the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts.\f + \fr 2.12 
\ft the master…: or, him that waketh, and him that answereth\f* 
\v 13  And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*
with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth
not the offering any more, or receiveth \add it\add* with good will
at your hand. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the \nd LORD\nd* hath been
witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt
treacherously: yet \add is\add* she thy companion, and the wife of thy
covenant. 
\v 15  And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take
heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the
wife of his youth.\f + \fr 2.15  \ft residue: or, excellency\f*\f + \fr 2.15 
\ft godly…: Heb. seed of God\f*\f + \fr 2.15  \ft treacherously: or,
unfaithfully\f* 
\v 16  For the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth
putting away: for \add one\add* covereth violence with his garment,
saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit,
that ye deal not treacherously.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft that he…: or, if he hate her, put her
away\f*\f + \fr 2.16  \ft putting…: Heb. to put away\f* 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Ye have wearied the \nd LORD\nd* with your words. Yet ye
say, Wherein have we wearied \add him?\add* When ye say, Every one that
doeth evil \add is\add* good in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and he
delighteth in them; or, Where \add is\add* the God of judgment? 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the
way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his
temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall
come, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\v 2  But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
when he appeareth? for he \add is\add* like a refiner’s fire, and like
fullers’ soap: 
\v 3  And he shall sit \add as\add* a refiner and purifier of silver:
and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
silver, that they may offer unto the \nd LORD\nd* an offering in
righteousness. 
\v 4  Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
unto the \nd LORD\nd*, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\f + \fr 3.4 
\ft former: or, ancient\f* 
\v 5  And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against
false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in \add his\add*
wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger
\add from his right\add*, and fear not me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts.\f + \fr 3.5  \ft oppress: or, defraud\f* 
\v 6 For I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, I change not; therefore ye
sons of Jacob are not consumed. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
ordinances, and have not kept \add them\add*. Return unto me, and I will
return unto you, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we
return? 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we
robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
\v 9 Ye \add are\add* cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me,
\add even\add* this whole nation. 
\v 10  Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you
out a blessing, that \add there shall\add* not \add be room\add*
enough \add to receive it\add*.\f + \fr 3.10  \ft pour…: Heb. empty
out\f* 
\v 11  And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her
fruit before the time in the field, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts.\f + \fr 3.11 
\ft destroy: Heb. corrupt\f* 
\v 12  And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
delightsome land, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Your words have been stout against me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
Yet ye say, What have we spoken \add so much\add* against thee? 
\v 14  Ye have said, It \add is\add* vain to serve God: and what
profit \add is it\add* that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have
walked mournfully before the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts?\f + \fr 3.14 
\ft ordinance: Heb. observation\f*\f + \fr 3.14  \ft mournfully: Heb. in
black\f* 
\v 15  And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness
are set up; yea, \add they that\add* tempt God are even delivered.\f + \fr 3.15 
\ft are set up: Heb. are built\f* 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Then they that feared the \nd LORD\nd* spake often one to
another: and the \nd LORD\nd* hearkened, and heard \add it\add*,
and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared
the \nd LORD\nd*, and that thought upon his name. 
\v 17  And they shall be mine, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, in that
day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth
 his own son that serveth him.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft jewels: or, special
treasure\f* 
\v 18  Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the
wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day
that cometh shall burn them up, saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts,
that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
arise  with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow
up as calves of the stall. 
\v 3  And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do \add this\add*,
saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
unto him in Horeb for all Israel, \add with\add* the statutes and
judgments. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
of the great and dreadful day of the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 6  And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite
the earth with a curse.
