\v 1  Now king David was old \add and\add* stricken in years; and they
covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.\f + \fr 1.1  \ft stricken…: Heb. entered into
days\f* 
\v 2  Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my
lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king,
and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord
the king may get heat.\f + \fr 1.2  \ft Let there…: Heb. Let them
seek\f*\f + \fr 1.2  \ft a young…: Heb. a damsel, a virgin\f*\f + \fr 1.2 
\ft cherish…: Heb. be a cherisher unto him\f* 
\v 3  So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts
of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
king. 
\v 4  And the damsel \add was\add* very fair, and cherished the king,
and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying,
I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty
men to run before him.\f + \fr 1.5  \ft be king: Heb. reign\f* 
\v 6  And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
Why hast thou done so? and he also \add was a\add* very goodly \add man;\add* and
\add his mother\add* bare him after Absalom.\f + \fr 1.6  \ft at any…: Heb. from his
days\f* 
\v 7  And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
the priest: and they following Adonijah helped \add him\add*.\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft he…: Heb. his words were with\f*\f + \fr 1.7  \ft following…: Heb. helped after
Adonijah\f* 
\v 8  But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which
\add belonged\add* to David, were not with Adonijah. 
\v 9  And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
of Zoheleth, which \add is\add* by En-rogel, and called all his brethren
the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:\f + \fr 1.9 
\ft En-rogel: or, the well Rogel\f* 
\v 10  But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
Solomon his brother, he called not. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon,
saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
reign, and David our lord knoweth \add it\add* not? 
\v 12  Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
\v 13  Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my
lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon
thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth
Adonijah reign? 
\v 14  Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come
in after thee, and confirm thy words.\f + \fr 1.14  \ft confirm: Heb. fill
up\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the
king. 
\v 16  And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
king said, What wouldest thou?\f + \fr 1.16  \ft What…: Heb. What to
thee?\f* 
\v 17  And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God unto thine handmaid, \add saying\add*, Assuredly Solomon
thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 
\v 18  And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
thou knowest \add it\add* not: 
\v 19  And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest,
and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not
called. 
\v 20  And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel \add are\add*
upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne
of my lord the king after him. 
\v 21  Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted
offenders.\f + \fr 1.21  \ft offenders: Heb. sinners\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet
also came in. 
\v 23  And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet.
And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the
king with his face to the ground. 
\v 24  And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
\v 25  For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons,
and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they
eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.\f + \fr 1.25 
\ft God…: Heb. Let king Adonijah live\f* 
\v 26 But me, \add even\add* me thy servant, and Zadok the priest,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
called. 
\v 27  Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
shewed \add it\add* unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne
of my lord the king after him? 
\p
\v 28 ¶ Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she
came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.\f + \fr 1.28 
\ft into…: Heb. before the king\f* 
\v 29  And the king sware, and said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, 
\v 30  Even as I sware unto thee by the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this
day. 
\v 31  Then Bath-sheba bowed with \add her\add* face to the earth,
and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
for ever. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
the king. 
\v 33  The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him
down to Gihon:\f + \fr 1.33  \ft mine…: Heb. which belongeth to me\f*
\v 34  And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there
king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save
king Solomon. 
\v 35  Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit
upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed
him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
\v 36  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
Amen: the \nd LORD\nd* God of my lord the king say so \add too\add*.
\v 37  As the \nd LORD\nd* hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king
David. 
\v 38  So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down,
and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to
Gihon. 
\v 39  And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people
said, God save king Solomon. 
\v 40  And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the
sound of them.\f + \fr 1.40  \ft pipes: or, flutes\f* 
\p
\v 41 ¶ And Adonijah and all the guests that \add were\add* with him
heard \add it\add* as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab
heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore \add is this\add*
noise of the city being in an uproar? 
\v 42  And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou \add art\add*
a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. 
\v 43  And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
king David hath made Solomon king. 
\v 44  And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites,
and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s
mule: 
\v 45  And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed
him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the
city rang again. This \add is\add* the noise that ye have heard.
\v 46  And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
\v 47  And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king
David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name,
and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the
bed. 
\v 48  And also thus said the king, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, which hath given \add one\add* to sit on my throne
this day, mine eyes even seeing \add it\add*. 
\v 49  And all the guests that \add were\add* with Adonijah were
afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 
\p
\v 50 ¶ And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
\v 51  And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth
king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,
saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay
his servant with the sword. 
\v 52  And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an
hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall
die. 
\v 53  So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him,
Go to thine house. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
charged Solomon his son, saying, 
\v 2  I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a
man; 
\v 3  And keep the charge of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, to walk in his
ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest
prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:\f + \fr 2.3 
\ft prosper: or, do wisely\f* 
\v 4  That the \nd LORD\nd* may continue his word which he spake
concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to
walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.\f + \fr 2.4 
\ft fail…: Heb. be cut off from thee from the throne\f* 
\v 5  Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
\add and\add* what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel,
unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he
slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war
upon his girdle that \add was\add* about his loins, and in his shoes that
\add were\add* on his feet.\f + \fr 2.5  \ft shed: Heb. put\f* 
\v 6  Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
head go down to the grave in peace. 
\v 7  But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came
to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 
\v 8 And, behold, \add thou hast\add* with thee Shimei the son of
Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse
in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at
Jordan, and I sware to him by the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, I will not put thee to
death with the sword.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft grievous: Heb. strong\f* 
\v 9  Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou \add art\add*
a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
head bring thou down to the grave with blood. 
\v 10  So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
of David. 
\v 11  And the days that David reigned over Israel \add were\add*
forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three
years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
kingdom was established greatly. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother
of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\v 14  He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
said, Say on. 
\v 15  And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and \add that\add*
all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the
kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
unto him, Say on.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft deny…: Heb. turn not away my
face\f* 
\v 17  And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not
say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
\v 18  And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the
king. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat
down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother;
and she sat on his right hand. 
\v 20  Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; \add I pray
thee\add*, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
mother: for I will not say thee nay. 
\v 21  And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
thy brother to wife. 
\v 22  And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou
ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he
\add is\add* mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the
priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
\v 23  Then king Solomon sware by the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, God do
so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own
life. 
\v 24 Now therefore, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, which hath
established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath
made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
this day. 
\v 25  And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
and he fell upon him that he died. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
unto thine own fields; for thou \add art\add* worthy of death: but I will not at this
time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord \nd GOD\nd*
before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my
father was afflicted.\f + \fr 2.26  \ft worthy…: Heb. a man of death\f*
\v 27  So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
\nd LORD\nd*; that he might fulfil the word of the \nd LORD\nd*,
which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle
of the \nd LORD\nd*, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
\v 29  And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle
of the \nd LORD\nd*; and, behold, \add he is\add* by the altar. Then
Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
\v 30  And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*, and
said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will
die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said
Joab, and thus he answered me. 
\v 31  And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and
bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab
shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 
\v 32  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall return his blood upon his own head,
who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
them with the sword, my father David not knowing \add thereof, to
wit\add*, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 
\v 33  Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab,
and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his
seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace
for ever from the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 34  So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth
thence any whither. 
\v 37 For it shall be, \add that\add* on the day thou goest out,
and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt
surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 
\v 38  And Shimei said unto the king, The saying \add is\add* good:
as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei
dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 
\v 39  And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.
And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants \add be\add* in
Gath. 
\v 40  And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants
from Gath. 
\v 41  And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem
to Gath, and was come again. 
\v 42  And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to
swear by the \nd LORD\nd*, and protested unto thee, saying, Know
for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The
word \add that\add* I have heard \add is\add* good. 
\v 43  Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the commandment that I have charged thee with? 
\v 44  The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness
which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father:
therefore the \nd LORD\nd* shall return thy wickedness upon thine own
head; 
\v 45  And king Solomon \add shall be\add* blessed, and the throne
of David shall be established before the \nd LORD\nd* for ever. 
\v 46  So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established
in the hand of Solomon. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an
end of building his own house, and the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the wall of Jerusalem round about. 
\v 2  Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no
house built unto the name of the \nd LORD\nd*, until those days.
\v 3  And Solomon loved the \nd LORD\nd*, walking in the statutes
of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
places. 
\v 4  And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that \add was\add*
the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer
upon that altar. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ In Gibeon the \nd LORD\nd* appeared to Solomon in a dream
by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. 
\v 6  And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth,
and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast
kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son
to sit on his throne, as \add it is\add* this day.\f + \fr 3.6  \ft mercy: or,
bounty\f* 
\v 7  And now, O \nd LORD\nd* my God, thou hast made thy servant
king instead of David my father: and I \add am but\add* a little
child: I know not \add how\add* to go out or come in. 
\v 8  And thy servant \add is\add* in the midst of thy people which thou hast
chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\v 9  Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge
thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able
to judge this thy so great a people?\f + \fr 3.9  \ft understanding: Heb.
hearing\f* 
\v 10  And the speech pleased  the Lord, that Solomon had asked this
thing. 
\v 11  And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing,
and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches
for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked
for thyself understanding to discern judgment;\f + \fr 3.11  \ft long life: Heb. many
days\f*\f + \fr 3.11  \ft discern: Heb. hear\f* 
\v 12  Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee
before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 
\v 13  And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the
kings like unto thee all thy days.\f + \fr 3.13  \ft shall…: or, hath not
been\f* 
\v 14  And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen
thy days. 
\v 15  And Solomon awoke; and, behold, \add it was\add* a dream.
And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant
of the \nd LORD\nd*, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered
peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Then came there two women, \add that were\add* harlots, unto the
king, and stood before him. 
\v 17  And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell
in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\v 18  And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
that this woman was delivered also: and we \add were\add* together;
\add there was\add* no stranger with us in the house, save we two
in the house. 
\v 19  And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
\v 20  And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine
handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child
in my bosom. 
\v 21  And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was
dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my
son, which I did bear. 
\v 22  And the other woman said, Nay; but the living \add is\add*
my son, and the dead \add is\add* thy son. And this said, No; but the
dead \add is\add* thy son, and the living \add is\add* my son. Thus they
spake before the king. 
\v 23  Then said the king, The one saith, This \add is\add* my son
that liveth, and thy son \add is\add* the dead: and the other saith,
Nay; but thy son \add is\add* the dead, and my son \add is\add* the
living. 
\v 24  And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
before the king. 
\v 25  And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
half to the one, and half to the other. 
\v 26  Then spake the woman whose the living child \add was\add*
unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said,
O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other
said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, \add but\add* divide \add it\add*.\f + \fr 3.26 
\ft yearned: Heb. were hot\f* 
\v 27  Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
and in no wise slay it: she \add is\add* the mother thereof. 
\v 28  And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God \add was\add*
in him, to do judgment.\f + \fr 3.28  \ft in him: Heb. in the midst of
him\f* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 
\v 2 And these \add were\add* the princes which he had; Azariah the
son of Zadok the priest,\f + \fr 4.2  \ft priest: or, chief officer\f*
\v 3  Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud, the recorder.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft scribes: or, secretaries\f*\f + \fr 4.3 
\ft recorder: or, remembrancer\f* 
\v 4  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \add was\add* over the host:
and Zadok and Abiathar \add were\add* the priests: 
\v 5  And Azariah the son of Nathan \add was\add* over the officers:
and Zabud the son of Nathan \add was\add* principal officer, \add and\add*
the king’s friend: 
\v 6  And Ahishar \add was\add* over the household: and Adoniram
the son of Abda \add was\add* over the tribute.\f + \fr 4.6  \ft tribute: or,
levy\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a

\p
\v 20 ¶ Judah and Israel \add were\add* many, as the sand which \add is\add*
by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
\v 21  And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought
presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour, and threescore measures of meal,\f + \fr 4.22  \ft provision: Heb.

\v 23  Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an

\v 24  For he had dominion over all \add the region\add* on this
side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 
\v 25  And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days
of Solomon.\f + \fr 4.25  \ft safely: Heb. confidently\f* 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen. 
\v 27  And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that
came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked
nothing. 
\v 28  Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
they unto the place where \add the officers\add* were, every man
according to his charge.\f + \fr 4.28  \ft dromedaries: or, mules, or, swift

\p
\v 29 ¶ And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
and largeness of heart, even as the sand that \add is\add* on the
sea shore. 
\v 30  And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
\v 31  For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all
nations round about. 
\v 32  And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
thousand and five. 
\v 33  And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that \add is\add*
in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he
spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
fishes. 
\v 34  And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father:
for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\f + \fr 5.1  \ft Hiram: also called,
Huram\f* 
\v 2  And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
\v 3  Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
unto the name of the \nd LORD\nd* his God for the wars which were about him on every
side, until the \nd LORD\nd* put them under the soles of his feet.
\v 4  But now the \nd LORD\nd* my God hath given me rest on every
side, \add so that there is\add* neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
\v 5  And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
\nd LORD\nd* my God, as the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto David my father,
saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
build an house unto my name.\f + \fr 5.5  \ft purpose: Heb. say\f*
\v 6  Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I
give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint:
for thou knowest that \add there is\add* not among us any that can
skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.\f + \fr 5.6  \ft appoint: Heb.
say\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
people. 
\v 8  And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou
sentest to me for: \add and\add* I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.\f + \fr 5.8  \ft considered: Heb.
heard\f* 
\v 9  My servants shall bring \add them\add* down from Lebanon unto the
sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt
receive \add them:\add* and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving
food for my household.\f + \fr 5.9  \ft appoint: Heb. send\f* 
\p
\v 10  So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees \add according
to\add* all his desire. 
\v 11  And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat \add for\add*
food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave
Solomon to Hiram year by year.\f + \fr 5.11  \ft measures: Heb. cors\f*
\v 12  And the \nd LORD\nd* gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was
peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the
levy was thirty thousand men.\f + \fr 5.13  \ft levy: Heb. tribute of
men\f* 
\v 14  And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
a month they were in Lebanon, \add and\add* two months at home: and
Adoniram \add was\add* over the levy. 
\v 15  And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
\v 16  Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which \add were\add*
over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
people that wrought in the work. 
\v 17  And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
stones, \add and\add* hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the
house. 
\v 18  And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew \add them\add*,
and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
the house.\f + \fr 5.18  \ft stonesquarers: or, Giblites\f* 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,
in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which
\add is\add* the second month, that he began to build the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 6.1  \ft began…: Heb. built\f* 
\v 2  And the house which king Solomon built for the \nd LORD\nd*,
the length thereof \add was\add* threescore cubits, and the breadth
thereof twenty \add cubits\add*, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
\v 3  And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
\add was\add* the length thereof, according to the breadth of the
house; \add and\add* ten cubits \add was\add* the breadth thereof before the
house. 
\v 4  And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.\f + \fr 6.4 
\ft of…: or, broad within, and narrow without: or, skewed and closed\f*
\p
\v 5 ¶ And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
about, \add against\add* the walls of the house round about, \add both\add*
of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:\f + \fr 6.5 
\ft against the wall: or, upon, or, joining to the wall\f*\f + \fr 6.5 
\ft built chambers: Heb. built floors\f*\f + \fr 6.5  \ft made chambers: Heb. made

\v 6  The nethermost chamber  \add was\add* five cubits broad, and the
middle \add was\add* six cubits broad, and the third \add was\add*
seven cubits broad: for without \add in the wall\add* of the house
he made narrowed rests round about, that \add the beams\add* should not be
fastened in the walls of the house.\f + \fr 6.6  \ft narrowed…: Heb. narrowings, or,
rebatements\f* 
\v 7  And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither
hammer nor axe \add nor\add* any tool of iron heard in the house,
while it was in building. 
\v 8  The door for the middle chamber \add was\add* in the right
side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the
middle \add chamber\add*, and out of the middle into the third.\f + \fr 6.8 
\ft side: Heb. shoulder\f* 
\v 9  So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
with beams and boards of cedar.\f + \fr 6.9  \ft with…: or, the vaultbeams and the panellings with
cedar\f* 
\v 10 And \add then\add* he built chambers against all the house,
five cubits high: and they rested on the house \add with\add* timber
of cedar. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Solomon, saying,
\v 12  \add Concerning\add* this house which thou art in building,
if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep
all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word
with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 
\v 13  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
forsake my people Israel. 
\v 14  So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
\p
\v 15  And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling:
\add and\add* he covered \add them\add* on the inside with wood,
and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.\f + \fr 6.15 
\ft both…: or, from the floor of the house unto the walls, etc\f*
\v 16  And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both
the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built \add them\add*
for it within, \add even\add* for the oracle, \add even\add* for the
most holy \add place\add*. 
\v 17  And the house, that \add is\add*, the temple before it, was
forty cubits \add long\add*. 
\v 18  And the cedar of the house within \add was\add* carved with
knops and open flowers: all \add was\add* cedar; there was no stone
seen.\f + \fr 6.18  \ft knops: or, gourds\f*\f + \fr 6.18  \ft open: Heb. openings

\v 19  And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the
ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 20  And the oracle in the forepart \add was\add* twenty cubits
in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the
height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and \add so\add*
covered the altar \add which was of\add* cedar.\f + \fr 6.20  \ft pure: Heb. shut
up\f* 
\v 21  So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a
partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid
it with gold. 
\v 22  And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the house: also the whole altar that \add was\add* by the oracle
he overlaid with gold. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And within the oracle he made two cherubims \add of\add*
olive tree, \add each\add* ten cubits high.\f + \fr 6.23  \ft olive: or, oily: Heb. trees of

\v 24  And five cubits \add was\add* the one wing of the cherub,
and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost

ten cubits. 
\v 25  And the other cherub \add was\add* ten cubits: both the cherubims
\add were\add* of one measure and one size. 
\v 26  The height of the one cherub \add was\add* ten cubits, and so
\add was it\add* of the other cherub. 
\v 27  And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched
forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the
\add one\add* wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the
other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the

\v 28  And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 
\v 29  And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within
and without.\f + \fr 6.29  \ft open flowers: Heb. openings of flowers\f*
\v 30  And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and

\p
\v 31 ¶ And for the entering of the oracle he made doors \add of\add*

\v 32  The two doors also \add were of\add* olive tree; and he carved

and upon the palm trees.\f + \fr 6.32  \ft two…: or, leaves of the

\v 33  So also made he for the door of the temple posts \add of\add*

\v 34  And the two doors \add were of\add* fir tree: the two leaves
of the one door \add were\add* folding, and the two leaves of the

\v 35  And he carved \add thereon\add* cherubims and palm trees and
open flowers: and covered \add them\add* with gold fitted upon the carved
work. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
and a row of cedar beams. 
\p
\v 37 ¶ In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the
\nd LORD\nd* laid, in the month Zif: 
\v 38  And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which \add is\add*
the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts

\c 7  
\p
\v 1  But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he

\p
\v 2 ¶ He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
\add was\add* an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,
with cedar beams upon the pillars. 
\v 3 And \add it was\add* covered with cedar above upon the beams, that

\v 16  And he made two chapiters \add of\add* molten brass, to set

\v 18  And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the

top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. 
\v 19  And the chapiters that \add were\add* upon the top of the

\v 20  And the chapiters upon the two pillars \add had pomegranates\add*
also above, over against the belly which \add was\add* by the network:
and the pomegranates \add were\add* two hundred in rows round about
upon the other chapiter. 
\v 21  And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set

\v 26 And it \add was\add* an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained

\p
\v 27 ¶ And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits \add was\add*

\v 29  And on the borders that \add were\add* between the ledges
\add were\add* lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges \add there
was\add* a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen \add were\add*

\v 30  And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver \add were\add*

\v 34 And \add there were\add* four undersetters to the four corners
of one base: \add and\add* the undersetters \add were\add* of the very

\v 36  For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders

\v 37 After this \add manner\add* he made the ten bases: all of them had

\v 39  And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and

\v 13  I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
for thee to abide in for ever. 
\v 14  And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation
of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;) 
\v 15  And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of

\v 17  And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
for the name of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 18  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine
heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine
heart. 
\v 19  Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth
out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* hath performed his word that he spake,

\v 28  Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his

\v 54 And it was \add so\add*, that when Solomon had made an end
of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
he arose from before the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*, from kneeling
on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. 
\v 55  And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a
loud voice, saying, 
\v 56  Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, that hath given rest
unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not

which he commanded our fathers. 
\v 59  And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication

\p
\v 62 ¶ And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 63  And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
offered unto the \nd LORD\nd*, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children
of Israel dedicated  the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 64  The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
\add was\add* before the house of the \nd LORD\nd*: for there he
offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
offerings: because the brasen altar that \add was\add* before the

and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. 
\v 65  And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a

of Egypt, before the \nd LORD\nd* our God, seven days and seven days,
\add even\add* fourteen days. 
\v 66  On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed

Israel his people.\f + \fr 8.66  \ft blessed: or, thanked\f*

\v 1  And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building
of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s
desire which he was pleased to do, 
\v 2  That the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  to Solomon the second time,
as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon. 
\v 3  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, I have heard thy prayer
and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed
this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever;
and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 
\v 4  And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,
in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have
commanded thee, \add and\add* wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
\v 5  Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel
for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not
fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 
\v 6  \add But\add* if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
children, and will not keep my commandments \add and\add* my statutes
which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
\v 7  Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast
out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people: 
\v 8  And at this house, \add which\add* is high, every one that
passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall
say, Why hath the \nd LORD\nd* done thus unto this land, and to this
house? 
\v 9  And they shall answer, Because they forsook the \nd LORD\nd*
their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and
served them: therefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* brought upon them all this
evil. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon
had built the two houses, the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the
king’s house, 
\v 11 (\add Now\add* Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon
with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his

\v 14  And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

\v 15 ¶ And this \add is\add* the reason of the levy which king Solomon
raised; for to build the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and his own house,
and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
Gezer. 
\v 16  \add For\add* Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken
Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt
in the city, and given it \add for\add* a present unto his daughter,
Solomon’s wife. 
\v 17  And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 
\v 18  And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 
\v 19  And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his
chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired

\v 21  Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did
Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. 
\v 22  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they
\add were\add* men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his
captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. 
\v 23 These \add were\add* the chief of the officers that \add were\add*

\p
\v 24 ¶ But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her

Millo. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
and he burnt incense upon the altar that \add was\add* before the

\p
\v 1  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the

\v 2  And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was

\v 10  And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more
such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to
king Solomon. 
\v 11  And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,

\v 28 ¶ And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\f + \fr 10.28 
\ft And Solomon…: Heb. And the going forth of the horses which was
Solomon’s\f* 
\v 29  And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
\add shekels\add* of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty:
and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring
\add them\add* out by their means.\f + \fr 10.29  \ft by their…: Heb. by their

\c 11  
\p
\v 1  But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,
Zidonians, \add and\add* Hittites;\f + \fr 11.1  \ft together…: or,
beside\f* 
\v 2  Of the nations \add concerning\add* which the \nd LORD\nd*
said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come
in unto you: \add for\add* surely they will turn away your heart
after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 
\v 3  And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
\v 4  For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, \add that\add* his
wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
perfect with the \nd LORD\nd* his God, as \add was\add* the heart
of David his father. 
\v 5  For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\f + \fr 11.5 
\ft Milcom: also called, Molech\f* 
\v 6  And Solomon did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and went not
fully after the \nd LORD\nd*, as \add did\add* David his father.\f + \fr 11.6 
\ft went…: Heb. fulfilled not after\f* 
\v 7  Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination
of Moab, in the hill that \add is\add* before Jerusalem, and for
Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
\v 8  And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
incense and sacrificed unto their gods. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* was angry with Solomon, because his heart
was turned from the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, which had appeared
unto him twice, 
\v 10  And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not
go after other gods: but he kept not that which the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded. 
\v 11  Wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not
kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will
surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.\f + \fr 11.11 
\ft is done…: Heb. is with thee\f* 
\v 12  Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
father’s sake: \add but\add* I will rend it out of the hand of thy
son. 
\v 13  Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; \add but\add*
will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for
Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* stirred up an adversary unto Solomon,
Hadad the Edomite: he \add was\add* of the king’s seed in Edom. 
\v 15  For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten
every male in Edom; 
\v 16 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut
off every male in Edom:) 
\v 17  That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants
with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad \add being\add* yet a little child.
\v 18  And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they
took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh
king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals,
and gave him land. 
\v 19  And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes
the queen. 
\v 20  And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s
household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
\v 21  And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,
Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.\f + \fr 11.21 
\ft Let…: Heb. Send me away\f* 
\v 22  Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou
seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me
go in any wise.\f + \fr 11.22  \ft Nothing: Heb. Not\f* 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And God stirred him up \add another\add* adversary, Rezon
the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
\v 24  And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
when David slew them \add of Zobah:\add* and they went to Damascus,
and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 
\v 25  And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
beside the mischief that Hadad \add did:\add* and he abhorred Israel,
and reigned over Syria. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s
servant, whose mother’s name \add was\add* Zeruah, a widow woman,
even he lifted up \add his\add* hand against the king. 
\v 27 And this \add was\add* the cause that he lifted up \add his\add*
hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, \add and\add* repaired
the breaches of the city of David his father.\f + \fr 11.27  \ft repaired: Heb.
closed\f* 
\v 28  And the man Jeroboam \add was\add* a mighty man of valour:
and Solomon seeing  the young man that he was industrious, he made him
ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.\f + \fr 11.28 
\ft was industrious: Heb. did work\f*\f + \fr 11.28  \ft charge: Heb.
burden\f* 
\v 29  And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the
way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two \add were\add*
alone in the field: 
\v 30  And Ahijah caught the new garment that \add was\add* on him, and
rent it \add in\add* twelve pieces: 
\v 31  And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: 
\v 32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for
Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel:) 
\v 33  Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth
the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and
Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my
ways, to do \add that which is\add* right in mine eyes, and \add to
keep\add* my statutes and my judgments, as \add did\add* David his
father. 
\v 34  Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand:
but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my
statutes: 
\v 35  But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will
give it unto thee, \add even\add* ten tribes. 
\v 36  And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have
chosen me to put my name there.\f + \fr 11.36  \ft light: Heb. lamp, or,
candle\f* 
\v 37  And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy
soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
\v 38  And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do \add that is\add* right in my
sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant
did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I
built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. 
\v 39  And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
ever. 
\v 40  Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt
until the death of Solomon. 
\p
\v 41 ¶ And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,
and his wisdom, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the
acts of Solomon?\f + \fr 11.41  \ft acts: or, words, or, things\f*
\v 42  And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
\add was\add* forty years.\f + \fr 11.42  \ft time: Heb. days\f*
\v 43  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.\f + \fr 11.43 
\ft Rehoboam: Gr. Roboam\f* 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem
to make him king. 
\v 2  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in
Egypt, heard \add of it\add*, (for he was fled from the presence
of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
\v 3  That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation
of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 
\v 4  Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us,
lighter, and we will serve thee. 
\v 5  And he said unto them, Depart yet \add for\add* three days,
then come again to me. And the people departed. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise
that I may answer this people? 
\v 7  And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and
speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
\v 8  But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him,
\add and\add* which stood before him: 
\v 9  And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy
father did put upon us lighter? 
\v 10  And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee,
saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \add it\add*
lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little \add finger\add*
shall be thicker than my father’s loins. 
\v 11  And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke,
I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips,
but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third
day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third
day. 
\v 13  And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
men’s counsel that they gave him;\f + \fr 12.13  \ft roughly: Heb.
hardly\f* 
\v 14  And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father
\add also\add* chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
scorpions. 
\v 15  Wherefore the king hearkened  not unto the people; for the
cause was from the \nd LORD\nd*, that he might perform his saying,
which the \nd LORD\nd* spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam
the son of Nebat. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the
people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither
\add have we\add* inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents,
O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their
tents. 
\v 17 But \add as for\add* the children of Israel which dwelt in the
cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
\v 18  Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who \add was\add* over the
tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem.\f + \fr 12.18  \ft made…: Heb. strengthened himself\f*
\v 19  So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.\f + \fr 12.19 
\ft rebelled: or, fell away\f* 
\v 20  And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come
again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him
king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David,
but the tribe of Judah only. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore
thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house
of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\v 22  But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\v 23  Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the
house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\v 24  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Ye shall not go up, nor fight
against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the
word of the \nd LORD\nd*, and returned to depart, according to the
word of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went
out from thence, and built Penuel. 
\v 26  And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
to the house of David: 
\v 27  If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*
at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their
lord, \add even\add* unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall
kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
\v 28  Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves \add of\add*
gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:
behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land
of Egypt. 
\v 29  And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.
\v 30  And this thing became a sin: for the people went \add to worship\add*
before the one, \add even\add* unto Dan. 
\v 31  And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
\v 32  And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that \add is\add*
in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing
unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests
of the high places which he had made.\f + \fr 12.32  \ft offered…: or, went up to the altar,
etc\f*\f + \fr 12.32  \ft sacrificing: or, to sacrifice\f* 
\v 33  So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el
the fifteenth day of the eighth month, \add even\add* in the month
which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.\f + \fr 12.33 
\ft offered…: or, went up to the altar, etc\f*\f + \fr 12.33  \ft and burnt…: Heb. to burn
incense\f* 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar
to burn incense.\f + \fr 13.1  \ft burn: or, offer\f* 
\v 2  And he cried against the altar in the word of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, a
child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he
offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and
men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee. 
\v 3  And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This \add is\add*
the sign which the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be
rent, and the ashes that \add are\add* upon it shall be poured out.
\v 4  And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put
forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,
which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in
again to him. 
\v 5  The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the
word of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
now the face of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and pray for me, that my
hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as \add it
was\add* before.\f + \fr 13.6  \ft the \+nd LORD\+nd*, and: Heb. the face of the
\+nd LORD\+nd*, etc\f* 
\v 7  And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
\v 8  And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat
bread nor drink water in this place: 
\v 9  For so was it charged me by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou
camest. 
\v 10  So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
came to Beth-el. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came
and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day
in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they
told also to their father. 
\v 12  And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
\v 13  And he said unto his sons, Saddle  me the ass. So they saddled
him the ass: and he rode thereon, 
\v 14  And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
oak: and he said unto him, \add Art\add* thou the man of God that
camest from Judah? And he said, I \add am\add*. 
\v 15  Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
\v 16  And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I
eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
\v 17  For it was said to me by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, Thou shalt
eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way
that thou camest.\f + \fr 13.17  \ft it…: Heb. a word was\f* 
\v 18  He said unto him, I \add am\add* a prophet also as thou \add art;\add*
and an angel spake unto me by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread
and drink water. \add But\add* he lied unto him. 
\v 19  So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house,
and drank water. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto the prophet that brought him back:
\v 21  And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
mouth of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hast not kept the commandment which the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God commanded  thee, 
\v 22  But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
place, of the which \add the \+nd Lord\+nd*\add* did say to thee,
Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the
sepulchre of thy fathers. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after
he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, \add to wit\add*,
for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
\v 24  And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew
him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the
lion also stood by the carcase. 
\v 25  And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told
\add it\add* in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
\v 26  And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
\add thereof\add*, he said, It \add is\add* the man of God, who was
disobedient unto the word of the \nd LORD\nd*: therefore the \nd LORD\nd*
hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain
him, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake unto
him.\f + \fr 13.26  \ft torn: Heb. broken\f* 
\v 27  And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they

\v 28  And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the
ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
the carcase, nor torn the ass.\f + \fr 13.28  \ft torn: Heb. broken\f*
\v 29  And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came
to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 
\v 30  And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
\add saying\add*, Alas, my brother! 
\v 31  And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake
to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre
wherein the man of God \add is\add* buried; lay my bones beside his
bones: 
\v 32  For the saying which he cried by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high
places which \add are\add* in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\p
\v 33 ¶ After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way,
but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:
whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became \add one\add*

\v 34  And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut

earth. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
\v 2  And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get
thee to Shiloh: behold, there \add is\add* Ahijah the prophet, which
told me that \add I should be\add* king over this people.

\p
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of

sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh
in, that she shall feign herself \add to be\add* another \add woman\add*.
\v 6 And it was \add so\add*, when Ahijah heard the sound of her
feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife
of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself \add to be\add* another? for I

\ft heavy: Heb. hard\f* 
\p
\v 7  Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee
prince over my people Israel, 
\v 8  And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and
\add yet\add* thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my
commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do \add that\add* only
\add which was\add* right in mine eyes; 
\v 9  But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast
gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to
anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
\v 10  Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam,
and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall,
\add and\add* him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take
away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung,
till it be all gone. 
\v 11  Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat;
and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the

\v 12  Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: \add and\add*
when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 
\v 13  And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of

Jeroboam. 
\v 14  Moreover the \nd LORD\nd* shall raise him up a king over Israel,
who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
\v 15  For the \nd LORD\nd* shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken

which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the
river, because they have made their groves, provoking the \nd LORD\nd*
to anger. 
\v 16  And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
who did sin, and who made Israel to sin. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
\add and\add* when she came to the threshold of the door, the child
died; 
\v 18  And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the
word of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake by the hand of his servant
Ahijah the prophet. 
\v 19  And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
reigned, behold, they \add are\add* written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel. 
\v 20  And the days which Jeroboam reigned \add were\add* two and
twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his
stead.\f + \fr 14.20  \ft slept: Heb. lay down\f* 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam
\add was\add* forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the \nd LORD\nd*
did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his
mother’s name \add was\add* Naamah an Ammonitess. 
\v 22  And Judah did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and they provoked him to
jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their
fathers had done. 
\v 23  For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
on every high hill, and under every green tree.\f + \fr 14.23  \ft images: or, standing images, or,
statues\f* 
\v 24  And there were also sodomites in the land: \add and\add* they
did according to all the abominations of the nations which the \nd LORD\nd*
cast out before the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, \add that\add*
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 
\v 26  And he took away the treasures of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took
away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
\v 27  And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
committed \add them\add* unto the hands of the chief of the guard,
which kept the door of the king’s house.\f + \fr 14.27  \ft guard: Heb.
runners\f* 
\v 28 And it was \add so\add*, when the king went into the house
of the \nd LORD\nd*, that the guard bare them, and brought them back
into the guard chamber. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
\add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah? 
\v 30  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all \add their\add*
days. 
\v 31  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name \add was\add*
Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.\f + \fr 14.31 
\ft Abijam: also called, Abijah: Gr. Abia\f* 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
reigned Abijam over Judah. 
\v 2  Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
\add was\add* Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\f + \fr 15.2  \ft Maachah…: also called, Michaiah the daughter of
Uriel\f*\f + \fr 15.2  \ft Abishalom: also called, Absalom\f* 
\v 3  And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
before him: and his heart was not perfect with the \nd LORD\nd* his
God, as the heart of David his father. 
\v 4  Nevertheless for David’s sake did the \nd LORD\nd* his God
give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
establish Jerusalem:\f + \fr 15.4  \ft lamp: or, candle\f* 
\v 5  Because David did \add that which was\add* right in the eyes
of the \nd LORD\nd*, and turned not aside from any \add thing\add*
that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the
matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
\v 6  And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
of his life. 
\v 7  Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
\v 8  And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
Asa over Judah. 
\v 10  And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s
name \add was\add* Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.\f + \fr 15.10 
\ft mother’s: that is, grandmother’s\f* 
\v 11  And Asa did \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the
\nd LORD\nd*, as \add did\add* David his father. 
\v 12  And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
all the idols that his fathers had made. 
\v 13  And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from \add being\add*
queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed
her idol, and burnt \add it\add* by the brook Kidron.\f + \fr 15.13 
\ft destroyed: Heb. cut off\f* 
\v 14  But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart
was perfect with the \nd LORD\nd* all his days. 
\v 15  And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*, silver, and gold, and vessels.\f + \fr 15.15  \ft things: Heb.
holy\f* 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
days. 
\v 17  And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king
of Judah. 
\v 18  Then Asa took all the silver and the gold \add that were\add*
left in the treasures of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the treasures
of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants:
and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son
of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
\v 19  \add There is\add* a league between me and thee, \add and\add*
between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a
present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha
king of Israel, that he may depart from me.\f + \fr 15.19  \ft depart: Heb. go

\v 20  So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains
of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the
land of Naphtali. 
\v 21  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard \add thereof\add*,
that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
\v 22  Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
\add was\add* exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built
with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.\f + \fr 15.22  \ft exempted: Heb.

\v 23  The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he
did, and the cities which he built, \add are\add* they not written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the
time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
\v 24  And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
stead.\f + \fr 15.24  \ft Jehoshaphat: Gr. Josaphat\f* 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel
in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel
two years.\f + \fr 15.25  \ft began…: Heb. reigned\f* 
\v 26  And he did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and walked
in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel
to sin. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired
 against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which \add belonged\add*
to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
\v 28  Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
him, and reigned in his stead. 
\v 29  And it came to pass, when he reigned, \add that\add* he smote
all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the \nd LORD\nd*,
which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
\v 30  Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel to anger. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 32  And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
days. 
\v 33  In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son
of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
\v 34  And he did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and walked
in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
sin. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Jehu the son of Hanani
against Baasha, saying, 
\v 2  Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee
prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of
Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to
anger with their sins; 
\v 3  Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity
of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat. 
\v 4  Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that
dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. 
\v 5  Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
might, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel? 
\v 6  So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:
and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 7  And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* against Baasha, and against his
house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*,
in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the
house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah
the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
\v 9  And his servant Zimri, captain of half \add his\add* chariots,
conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk
in the house of Arza steward of \add his\add* house in Tirzah.\f + \fr 16.9

\v 10  And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty

\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he
sat on his throne, \add that\add* he slew all the house of Baasha:
he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks,
nor of his friends.\f + \fr 16.11  \ft neither…: or, both his kinsmen and his
friends\f* 
\v 12  Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the

prophet,\f + \fr 16.12  \ft by: Heb. by the hand of\f* 
\v 13  For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son,
by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the
\nd LORD\nd* God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
\v 14  Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\p
\v 15 ¶ In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people \add were\add* encamped
against Gibbethon, which \add belonged\add* to the Philistines. 
\v 16  And the people \add that were\add* encamped heard say, Zimri
hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel
made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the
camp. 
\v 17  And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they
besieged Tirzah. 
\v 18  And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s
house over him with fire, and died, 
\v 19  For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he
did, to make Israel to sin. 
\v 20  Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
wrought, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel? 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half
of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;
and half followed Omri. 
\v 22  But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\p
\v 23 ¶ In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
\v 24  And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he
built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.\f + \fr 16.24 
\ft Samaria: Heb. Shomeron\f* 
\p
\v 25 ¶ But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*, and did
worse than all that \add were\add* before him. 
\v 26  For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
\v 27  Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
that he shewed, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 28  So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria:
and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri
reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
\v 30  And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd* above all that
\add were\add* before him. 
\v 31  And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to
walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife
Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and
served Baal, and worshipped him.\f + \fr 16.31  \ft as if…: Heb. was it a light thing,
etc\f* 
\v 32  And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had
built in Samaria. 
\v 33  And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
\p
\v 34 ¶ In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the
foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates
thereof in his youngest \add son\add* Segub, according to the word
of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  And Elijah the Tishbite, \add who was\add* of the inhabitants

\v 4 And it shall be, \add that\add* thou shalt drink of the brook;
and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
\v 5  So he went and did according unto the word of the \nd LORD\nd*:
for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that \add is\add* before
Jordan. 
\v 6  And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
\v 7  And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
because there had been no rain in the land.\f + \fr 17.7  \ft after…: Heb. at the end of

\p
\v 8 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto him, saying,

\v 10  So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the

little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
\v 11  And as she was going to fetch \add it\add*, he called to her, and
said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
\v 12  And she said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God liveth,
I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little
oil in a cruse: and, behold, I \add am\add* gathering two sticks,
that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat

\v 13  And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go \add and\add* do as thou hast
said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring \add it\add*
unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. 
\v 14  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, The barrel

was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 
\v 18  And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance,
and to slay my son? 
\v 19  And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her
bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own
bed. 
\v 20  And he cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, O \nd LORD\nd*

by slaying her son? 
\v 21  And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried

\v 23  And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the

said, See, thy son liveth. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou
\add art\add* a man of God, \add and\add* that the word of the \nd LORD\nd*

\c 18  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass \add after\add* many days, that the word

\v 2  And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And \add there was\add*

\v 3  And Ahab called Obadiah, which \add was\add* the governor of

\ft that…: Heb. that we cut not off ourselves from the beasts\f*
\v 6  So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:

\p
\v 7 ¶ And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
knew him, and fell on his face, and said, \add Art\add* thou that my

\v 8  And he answered him, I \add am:\add* go, tell thy lord, Behold,

\v 13  Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets
of the \nd LORD\nd*, how I hid an hundred men of the \nd LORD’s\nd*

\v 14  And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \add is

\v 15  And Elijah said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts liveth,
before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. 
\v 16  So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went
to meet Elijah. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,
\add Art\add* thou he that troubleth Israel? 
\v 18  And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the

\v 19  Now therefore send, \add and\add* gather to me all Israel
unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty,
and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s
table. 
\v 20  So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered
the prophets together unto mount Carmel. 
\p
\v 21  And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt

\v 28  And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.\f + \fr 18.28

\v 29  And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the

\v 30  And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the
people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*
\add that was\add* broken down. 
\v 31  And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
\v 32  And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*:
and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two
measures of seed. 
\v 33  And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
laid \add him\add* on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with
water, and pour \add it\add* on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
\v 34  And he said, Do \add it\add* the second time. And they did
\add it\add* the second time. And he said, Do \add it\add* the third
time. And they did \add it\add* the third time. 
\v 35  And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
trench also with water.\f + \fr 18.35  \ft ran: Heb. went\f* 
\v 36 And it came to pass at \add the time of\add* the offering of the
\add evening\add* sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and
said, \nd LORD\nd* God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be
known this day that thou \add art\add* God in Israel, and \add that\add* I
\add am\add* thy servant, and \add that\add* I have done all these things at thy

\v 37  Hear me, O \nd LORD\nd*, hear me, that this people may know that thou
\add art\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God, and \add that\add* thou hast
turned their heart back again. 
\v 38  Then the fire of the \nd LORD\nd* fell, and consumed the burnt
sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked
up the water that \add was\add* in the trench. 
\v 39  And when all the people saw \add it\add*, they fell on their
faces: and they said, The \nd LORD\nd*, he \add is\add* the God;
the \nd LORD\nd*, he \add is\add* the God. 
\v 40  And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down
to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.\f + \fr 18.40  \ft Take: or,

\v 42  So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his
face between his knees, 
\v 43  And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went
up, and looked, and said, \add There is\add* nothing. And he said,
Go again seven times. 
\v 44  And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there
ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he
said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare \add thy chariot\add*, and get thee
down, that the rain stop thee not.\f + \fr 18.44  \ft Prepare: Heb. Tie, or,

\v 45  And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab
rode, and went to Jezreel. 
\v 46  And the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was on Elijah; and he girded
up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\f + \fr 18.46 
\ft to the…: Heb. till thou come to Jezreel\f* 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had
slain all the prophets with the sword. 
\v 2  Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
gods do \add to me\add*, and more also, if I make not thy life as the
life of one of them by to morrow about this time. 
\v 3  And when he saw \add that\add*, he arose, and went for his
life, and came to Beer-sheba, which \add belongeth\add* to Judah,
and left his servant there. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and
came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself
that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O \nd LORD\nd*, take
away my life; for I \add am\add* not better than my fathers.\f + \fr 19.4 
\ft for himself: Heb. for his life\f* 
\v 5  And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise \add and\add* eat. 
\v 6  And he looked, and, behold, \add there was\add* a cake baken on the

and laid him down again.\f + \fr 19.6  \ft head: Heb. bolster\f*
\v 7  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* came again the second time,
and touched him, and said, Arise \add and\add* eat; because the journey
\add is\add* too great for thee. 
\v 8  And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of
God. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* \add came\add* to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here,
Elijah? 
\v 10  And he said, I have been very jealous for the \nd LORD\nd*
God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I,
\add even\add* I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
away. 
\v 11  And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
\nd LORD\nd*. And, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* passed by, and a great
and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks
before the \nd LORD\nd*; \add but\add* the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add*
not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; \add but\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* not in the earthquake: 
\v 12  And after the earthquake a fire; \add but\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
\add was\add* not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
\v 13 And it was \add so\add*, when Elijah heard \add it\add*, that he
wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering
in of the cave. And, behold, \add there came\add* a voice unto him, and
said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
\v 14  And he said, I have been very jealous for the \nd LORD\nd*
God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I,
\add even\add* I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it
away. 
\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Go, return on thy way
to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael
\add to be\add* king over Syria: 
\v 16  And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint \add to be\add*

\p
\v 19 ¶ So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who
\add was\add* plowing \add with\add* twelve yoke \add of oxen\add*
before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and
cast his mantle upon him. 
\v 20  And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee,

said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?\f + \fr 19.20 
\ft Go…: Heb. Go return\f* 
\v 21  And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and

and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went
after Elijah, and ministered unto him. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and
\add there were\add* thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
\v 2  And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad, 
\v 3  Thy silver and thy gold \add is\add* mine; thy wives also and thy
children, \add even\add* the goodliest, \add are\add* mine. 
\v 4  And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
according to thy saying, I \add am\add* thine, and all that I have.
\v 5  And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad,
saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver
me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
\v 6  Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this

\v 7  Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land,
and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this \add man\add* seeketh

and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.\f + \fr 20.7 
\ft I denied…: Heb. I kept not back from him\f* 
\v 8  And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not
\add unto him\add*, nor consent. 
\v 9  Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my
lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the
first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers
departed, and brought him word again. 
\v 10  And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more
also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the
people that follow me.\f + \fr 20.10  \ft follow…: Heb. are at my

\v 11  And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell \add him\add*,
Let not him that girdeth on \add his harness\add* boast himself as he that putteth it

\p
\v 12 And it came to pass, when \add Ben-hadad\add* heard this message, as he
\add was\add* drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he
said unto his servants, Set \add yourselves in array\add*. And they

\p
\v 13 ¶ And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Hast thou seen all this great

\ft young…: or, servants\f*\f + \fr 20.14  \ft order: Heb. bind, or,

\v 15  Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered
all the people, \add even\add* all the children of Israel, \add being\add*
seven thousand. 
\v 16  And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad \add was\add* drinking
himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and
two kings that helped him. 
\v 17  And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are
men come out of Samaria. 
\v 18  And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. 
\v 19  So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out
of the city, and the army which followed them. 
\v 20  And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an
horse with the horsemen. 
\v 21  And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the

\v 23  And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their

\v 24  And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his

\v 28 ¶ And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,

\v 29  And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And
\add so\add* it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined:
and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand

\v 30  But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and \add there\add*

\v 32  So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and \add put\add*

\v 33  Now the men did diligently observe whether \add any thing would

\v 36  Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice

\v 39  And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a

\v 43  And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,

\v 1  And it came to pass after these things, \add that\add* Naboth

by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
\v 2  And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a

\v 3  And Naboth said to Ahab, The \nd LORD\nd* forbid it me, that I should

\v 4  And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the
word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said,
I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him
down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\p
\v 5 ¶ But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
\v 6  And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite,
and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it
please thee, I will give thee \add another\add* vineyard for it: and he
answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. 
\v 7  And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
kingdom of Israel? arise, \add and\add* eat bread, and let thine
heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\v 8  So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed \add them\add*
with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that
\add were\add* in his city, dwelling  with Naboth. 
\v 9  And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and
set Naboth on high among the people:\f + \fr 21.9  \ft on high…: Heb. in the top of the

\v 10  And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness

carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
\v 11  And the men of his city, \add even\add* the elders and the

\add and\add* as it \add was\add* written in the letters which she had
sent unto them. 
\v 12  They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\v 13  And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the
men of Belial witnessed against him, \add even\add* against Naboth,
in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the
king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with
stones, that he died. 
\v 14  Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
dead. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for
money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
\v 16  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
to take possession of it. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Elijah the Tishbite,
saying,

\v 19  And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak
unto him, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, In the place where

\v 20  And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
And he answered, I have found \add thee:\add* because thou hast sold
thyself to work evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 21  Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy

\v 22  And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the

\v 27  And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he
rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and
lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
\v 28  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Elijah the Tishbite,
saying, 
\v 29  Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he

\v 1  And they continued three years without war between Syria and

take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?\f + \fr 22.3  \ft still…: Heb. silent from taking
it\f* 
\v 4  And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I \add am\add*
as thou \add art\add*, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
horses. 
\v 5  And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* to day. 
\v 6  Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead
to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord
shall deliver \add it\add* into the hand of the king. 
\v 7  And Jehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a prophet
of the \nd LORD\nd* besides, that we might enquire of him? 
\v 8  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \add There is\add*
yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the
\nd LORD\nd*: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but
evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
\v 9  Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
\add hither\add* Micaiah the son of Imlah.\f + \fr 22.9  \ft officer: or,
eunuch\f* 
\v 10  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the
entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied
before them.\f + \fr 22.10  \ft void…: Heb. floor\f* 
\v 11  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron:
and he said, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, With these shalt thou push
the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. 
\v 12  And all the prophets prophesied  so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead,
and prosper: for the \nd LORD\nd* shall deliver \add it\add* into the
king’s hand. 
\v 13  And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets \add declare\add* good
unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the
word of one of them, and speak \add that which is\add* good. 
\v 14  And Micaiah said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, what the
\nd LORD\nd* saith unto me, that will I speak. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?
And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the \nd LORD\nd* shall
deliver \add it\add* into the hand of the king. 
\v 16  And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure
thee that thou tell me nothing but \add that which is\add* true in the
name of the \nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 17  And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
sheep that have not a shepherd: and the \nd LORD\nd* said, These have no
master: let them return every man to his house in peace. 
\v 18  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
\v 19  And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the \nd LORD\nd*:
I saw the \nd LORD\nd* sitting  on his throne, and all the host of
heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go
up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another
said on that manner.\f + \fr 22.20  \ft persuade: or, deceive\f*
\v 21  And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and said, I will persuade him. 
\v 22  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Wherewith? And he said,
I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade \add him\add*, and prevail
also: go forth, and do so. 
\v 23  Now therefore, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath put a lying spirit
in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath
spoken evil concerning thee. 
\v 24  But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd*
from me to speak unto thee? 
\v 25  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt
go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.\f + \fr 22.25  \ft into…: or, from chamber to chamber: Heb. a chamber in a
chamber\f* 
\v 26  And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;
\v 27  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this \add fellow\add* in the
prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
until I come in peace. 
\v 28  And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the \nd LORD\nd*
hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
\p
\v 29  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
up to Ramoth-gilead. 
\v 30  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the
king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.\f + \fr 22.30 
\ft I will…: or, when he was to disguise himself, and enter into the
battle\f* 
\v 31  But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small
nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
\v 32  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it \add is\add* the king of Israel.
And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried
out. 
\v 33  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it
\add was\add* not the king of Israel, that they turned back from
pursuing him. 
\v 34 And a \add certain\add* man drew a bow at a venture, and smote
the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he
said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
out of the host; for I am wounded.\f + \fr 22.34  \ft at a…: Heb. in his
simplicity\f*\f + \fr 22.34  \ft joints…: Heb. joints and the breastplate\f*\f + \fr 22.34 
\ft wounded: Heb. made sick\f* 
\v 35  And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed
up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the
blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.\f + \fr 22.35 
\ft increased: Heb. ascended\f*\f + \fr 22.35  \ft midst: Heb. bosom\f*
\v 36  And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going
down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own
country. 
\p
\v 37 ¶ So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
the king in Samaria.\f + \fr 22.37  \ft was brought: Heb. came\f*
\v 38 And \add one\add* washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria;
and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* which he spake. 
\v 39  Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 40  So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah
in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
\v 42  Jehoshaphat \add was\add* thirty and five years old when he began to
reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his
mother’s name \add was\add* Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
\v 43  And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
aside from it, doing \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the
\nd LORD\nd*: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; \add for\add*
the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. 
\v 44  And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
\v 45  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
shewed, and how he warred, \add are\add* they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 46  And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days
of his father Asa, he took out of the land. 
\v 47  \add There was\add* then no king in Edom: a deputy \add was\add*
king. 
\v 48  Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.\f + \fr 22.48 
\ft made…: or, had ten ships\f* 
\v 49  Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\p
\v 50 ¶ And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 51 ¶ Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two
years over Israel. 
\v 52  And he did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and walked
in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the
way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 
\v 53  For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, according to all that his father
had done.
