\c 1  
\p
\v 1 These \add be\add* the words which Moses spake unto all Israel
on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against
the Red \add sea\add*, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and
Hazeroth, and Dizahab.\f + \fr 1.1  \ft the Red…: or, Zuph\f* 
\v 2 (\add There are\add* eleven days’ \add journey\add* from Horeb
by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.) 
\v 3  And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,
on the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* Moses spake
unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the \nd LORD\nd*
had given him in commandment unto them; 
\v 4  After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in
Edrei: 
\v 5  On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
this law, saying, 
\v 6  The \nd LORD\nd* our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have
dwelt long enough in this mount: 
\v 7  Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
Amorites, and unto all \add the places\add* nigh thereunto, in the
plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the
sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the
great river, the river Euphrates.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft all…: Heb. all his
neighbours\f* 
\v 8  Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
land which the \nd LORD\nd* sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.\f + \fr 1.8 
\ft set: Heb. given\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
bear you myself alone: 
\v 10  The \nd LORD\nd* your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye
\add are\add* this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
\v 11 (The \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers make you a thousand times
so many more as ye \add are\add*, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
\v 12  How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
and your strife? 
\v 13  Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.\f + \fr 1.13  \ft Take: Heb.
Give\f* 
\v 14  And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
\add is\add* good \add for us\add* to do. 
\v 15  So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over
hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
officers among your tribes.\f + \fr 1.15  \ft made: Heb. gave\f*
\v 16  And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear \add the
causes\add* between your brethren, and judge righteously between
\add every\add* man and his brother, and the stranger \add that is\add* with him.
\v 17  Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; \add but\add* ye shall
hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
face of man; for the judgment \add is\add* God’s: and the cause that is too
hard for you, bring \add it\add* unto me, and I will hear it.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft respect…: Heb. acknowledge faces\f* 
\v 18  And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should
do. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain
of the Amorites, as the \nd LORD\nd* our God commanded us; and we
came to Kadesh-barnea. 
\v 20  And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
Amorites, which the \nd LORD\nd* our God doth give unto us. 
\v 21  Behold, the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath set the land before
thee: go up \add and\add* possess \add it\add*, as the \nd LORD\nd*
God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring
us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall
come. 
\v 23  And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
one of a tribe: 
\v 24  And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the
valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 
\v 25  And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
\add it\add* down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, \add It
is\add* a good land which the \nd LORD\nd* our God doth give us.
\v 26  Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* your God: 
\v 27  And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the \nd LORD\nd*
hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver
us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
\v 28  Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
heart, saying, The people \add is\add* greater and taller than we; the
cities \add are\add* great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
seen the sons of the Anakims there.\f + \fr 1.28  \ft discouraged: Heb.
melted\f* 
\v 29  Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\v 30  The \nd LORD\nd* your God which goeth before you, he shall
fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
eyes; 
\v 31  And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye
went, until ye came into this place. 
\v 32  Yet in this thing ye did not believe the \nd LORD\nd* your
God, 
\v 33  Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place
to pitch your tents \add in\add*, in fire by night, to shew you by what
way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. 
\v 34  And the \nd LORD\nd* heard the voice of your words, and was
wroth, and sware, saying, 
\v 35  Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation
see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 
\v 36  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I
give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath
wholly followed the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 1.36  \ft wholly…: Heb. fulfilled to go
after\f* 
\v 37  Also the \nd LORD\nd* was angry with me for your sakes, saying,
Thou also shalt not go in thither. 
\v 38  \add But\add* Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before
thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
to inherit it. 
\v 39  Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey,
and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall
possess it. 
\v 40 But \add as for\add* you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 
\v 41  Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
\nd LORD\nd*, we will go up and fight, according to all that the
\nd LORD\nd* our God commanded  us. And when ye had girded on every
man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. 
\v 42  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up,
neither fight; for I \add am\add* not among you; lest ye be smitten
before your enemies. 
\v 43  So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the
commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*, and went presumptuously up into the
hill.\f + \fr 1.43  \ft went…: Heb. ye were presumptuous, and went
up\f* 
\v 44  And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, \add even\add*
unto Hormah. 
\v 45  And ye returned and wept before the \nd LORD\nd*; but the
\nd LORD\nd* would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
\v 46  So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
abode \add there\add*. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea, as the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto me: and we compassed
mount Seir many days. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto me, saying, 
\v 3  Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\v 4  And command thou the people, saying, Ye \add are\add* to pass
through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
\v 5  Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir
unto Esau \add for\add* a possession.\f + \fr 2.5  \ft no…: Heb. even to the treading of the sole of the
foot\f* 
\v 6  Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also
buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
\v 7  For the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath blessed thee in all the works
of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
these forty years the \nd LORD\nd* thy God \add hath been\add* with thee; thou hast
lacked nothing. 
\p
\v 8  And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of
Moab. 
\v 9  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Distress not the Moabites,
neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
land \add for\add* a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
children of Lot \add for\add* a possession.\f + \fr 2.9  \ft Distress…: or, Use no hostility against
Moab\f* 
\v 10  The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
many, and tall, as the Anakims; 
\v 11  Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
Moabites call them Emims. 
\v 12  The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children
of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his
possession, which the \nd LORD\nd* gave unto them.\f + \fr 2.12 
\ft succeeded: Heb. inherited\f*\f + \fr 2.12  \ft stead: or, room\f*
\v 13  Now rise up, \add said I\add*, and get you over the brook
Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.\f + \fr 2.13  \ft brook: or,
valley\f* 
\v 14  And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come
over the brook Zered, \add was\add* thirty and eight years; until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host,
as the \nd LORD\nd* sware unto them.\f + \fr 2.14  \ft brook: or,
valley\f* 
\v 15  For indeed the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against them, to
destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed
and dead from among the people, 
\v 17  That the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto me, saying, 
\v 18  Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this
day: 
\v 19 And \add when\add* thou comest nigh over against the children
of Ammon, distress  them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not
give thee of the land of the children of Ammon \add any\add* possession;
because I have given it unto the children of Lot \add for\add* a
possession. 
\v 20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old
time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;\f + \fr 2.20  \ft Zamzummims: also called,
Zuzims\f* 
\v 21  A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
\nd LORD\nd* destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
dwelt in their stead: 
\v 22  As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and
dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 
\v 23  And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, \add even\add* unto
Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed
them, and dwelt in their stead.) 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon,
and his land: begin to possess \add it\add*, and contend with him in
battle.\f + \fr 2.24  \ft begin…: Heb. begin, possess\f* 
\v 25  This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear
of thee upon the nations \add that are\add* under the whole heaven,
who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish
because of thee. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
\v 27  Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high
way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
\v 28  Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give
me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my
feet; 
\v 29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the
land which the \nd LORD\nd* our God giveth us. 
\v 30  But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate,
that he might deliver him into thy hand, as \add appeareth\add* this
day. 
\v 31  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Behold, I have begun to
give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
inherit his land. 
\v 32  Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
fight at Jahaz. 
\v 33  And the \nd LORD\nd* our God delivered him before us; and we
smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 
\v 34  And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left
none to remain:\f + \fr 2.34  \ft the men…: Heb. every city of men, and women, and little
ones\f* 
\v 35  Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
spoil of the cities which we took. 
\v 36  From Aroer, which \add is\add* by the brink of the river of
Arnon, and \add from\add* the city that \add is\add* by the river,
even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the \nd LORD\nd*
our God delivered all unto us: 
\v 37  Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
\add nor\add* unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities
in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the \nd LORD\nd* our God forbad
 us. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at
Edrei. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Fear him not: for I will
deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt
do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which
dwelt at Heshbon. 
\v 3  So the \nd LORD\nd* our God delivered into our hands Og also, the
king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
left to him remaining. 
\v 4  And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of
Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
\v 5  All these cities \add were\add* fenced with high walls, gates,
and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. 
\v 6  And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every
city. 
\v 7  But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
prey to ourselves. 
\v 8  And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
Amorites the land that \add was\add* on this side Jordan, from the
river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 
\v 9 (\add Which\add* Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites
call it Shenir;) 
\v 10  All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
\v 11  For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
behold, his bedstead \add was\add* a bedstead of iron; \add is\add*
it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits \add was\add*
the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the
cubit of a man. 
\p
\v 12  And this land, \add which\add* we possessed at that time,
from Aroer, which \add is\add* by the river Arnon, and half mount
Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the
Gadites. 
\v 13  And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, \add being\add* the
kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region
of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 
\v 14  Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day. 
\v 15  And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
\v 16  And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead
even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the
river Jabbok, \add which is\add* the border of the children of Ammon;
\v 17  The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast \add thereof\add*,
from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, \add even\add* the
salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft Ashdoth-pisgah: or, the springs of Pisgah, or, the
hill\f* 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And I commanded you at that time, saying, The \nd LORD\nd*
your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all \add that
are\add* meet for the war.\f + \fr 3.18  \ft meet…: Heb. sons of
power\f* 
\v 19  But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (\add for\add*
I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have
given you; 
\v 20  Until the \nd LORD\nd* have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and
\add until\add* they also possess the land which the \nd LORD\nd*
your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and \add then\add* shall ye
return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
seen all that the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath done unto these two
kings: so shall the \nd LORD\nd* do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
passest. 
\v 22  Ye shall not fear them: for the \nd LORD\nd* your God he shall
fight for you. 
\v 23  And I besought the \nd LORD\nd* at that time, saying, 
\v 24  O Lord \nd GOD\nd*, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy
greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God \add is there\add* in
heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy
might? 
\v 25  I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that \add is\add*
beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 
\v 26  But the \nd LORD\nd* was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
hear me: and the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Let it suffice thee;
speak no more unto me of this matter. 
\v 27  Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold
\add it\add* with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\f + \fr 3.27 
\ft Pisgah: or, the hill\f* 
\v 28  But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go
over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land
which thou shalt see. 
\v 29  So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
judgments, which I teach you, for to do \add them\add*, that ye may
live, and go in and possess the land which the \nd LORD\nd* God of your
fathers giveth you. 
\v 2  Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
diminish \add ought\add* from it, that ye may keep the commandments
of the \nd LORD\nd* your God which I command you. 
\v 3  Your eyes have seen what the \nd LORD\nd* did because of Baal-peor:
for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the \nd LORD\nd* thy God
hath destroyed them from among you. 
\v 4  But ye that did cleave unto the \nd LORD\nd* your God \add are\add*
alive every one of you this day. 
\v 5  Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
\nd LORD\nd* my God commanded  me, that ye should do so in the land
whither ye go to possess it. 
\v 6  Keep therefore and do \add them;\add* for this \add is\add*
your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall
hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation \add is\add*
a wise and understanding people. 
\v 7  For what nation \add is there so\add* great, who \add hath\add*
God \add so\add* nigh unto them, as the \nd LORD\nd* our God \add is\add* in all
\add things that\add* we call upon him \add for\add*? 
\v 8  And what nation \add is there so\add* great, that hath statutes
and judgments \add so\add* righteous as all this law, which I set
before you this day? 
\v 9  Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart
from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons,
and thy sons’ sons; 
\v 10  \add Specially\add* the day that thou stoodest before the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God in Horeb, when the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me,
Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words,
that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live
upon the earth, and \add that\add* they may teach their children.
\v 11  And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds,
and thick darkness.\f + \fr 4.11  \ft midst: Heb. heart\f* 
\v 12  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto you out of the midst of the
fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only
\add ye heard\add* a voice.\f + \fr 4.12  \ft only…: Heb. save a
voice\f* 
\v 13  And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded
you to perform, \add even\add* ten commandments; and he wrote them upon
two tables of stone. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  me at that time to teach
you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
over to possess it. 
\v 15  Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of
similitude on the day \add that\add* the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto you in
Horeb out of the midst of the fire: 
\v 16  Lest ye corrupt \add yourselves\add*, and make you a graven
image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\v 17  The likeness of any beast that \add is\add* on the earth,
the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 
\v 18  The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
likeness of any fish that \add is\add* in the waters beneath the
earth: 
\v 19  And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, \add even\add* all the
host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole
heaven.\f + \fr 4.19  \ft divided: or, imparted\f* 
\v 20  But the \nd LORD\nd* hath taken you, and brought you forth
out of the iron furnace, \add even\add* out of Egypt, to be unto him a
people of inheritance, as \add ye are\add* this day. 
\v 21  Furthermore the \nd LORD\nd* was angry with me for your sakes,
and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
go in unto that good land, which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth
 thee \add for\add* an inheritance: 
\v 22  But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go
over, and possess that good land. 
\v 23  Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
\nd LORD\nd* your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
image, \add or\add* the likeness of any \add thing\add*, which the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God hath forbidden thee. 
\v 24  For the \nd LORD\nd* thy God \add is\add* a consuming fire,
\add even\add* a jealous God. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children,
and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt \add yourselves\add*,
and make a graven image, \add or\add* the likeness of any \add thing\add*,
and shall do evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, to provoke him to
anger: 
\v 26  I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall
soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan
to possess it; ye shall not prolong \add your\add* days upon it, but shall
utterly be destroyed. 
\v 27  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall scatter you among the nations,
and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the
\nd LORD\nd* shall lead you. 
\v 28  And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood
and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
\v 29  But if from thence thou shalt seek the \nd LORD\nd* thy God,
thou shalt find \add him\add*, if thou seek him with all thy heart
and with all thy soul. 
\v 30  When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee,

\v 31 (For the \nd LORD\nd* thy God \add is\add* a merciful God;)
he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant
of thy fathers which he sware unto them. 
\v 32  For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the
day that God created man upon the earth, and \add ask\add* from the one
side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been \add any such
thing\add* as this great thing \add is\add*, or hath been heard like it?
\v 33 Did \add ever\add* people hear the voice of God speaking out
of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 
\v 34  Or hath God assayed to go \add and\add* take him a nation
from the midst of \add another\add* nation, by temptations, by signs,
and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched
out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the \nd LORD\nd*
your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
\v 35  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the
\nd LORD\nd* he \add is\add* God; \add there is\add* none else beside
him. 
\v 36  Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou
heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 
\v 37  And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty
power out of Egypt; 
\v 38  To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou
\add art\add*, to bring thee in, to give thee their land \add for\add*
an inheritance, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 39  Know therefore this day, and consider \add it\add* in thine
heart, that the \nd LORD\nd* he \add is\add* God in heaven above,
and upon the earth beneath: \add there is\add* none else. 
\v 40  Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy

upon the earth, which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth  thee, for ever.

\v 41 ¶ Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
sunrising; 
\v 42  That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing
unto one of these cities he might live:

of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan
in Bashan, of the Manassites. 
\p
\v 44 ¶ And this \add is\add* the law which Moses set before the
children of Israel: 
\v 45 These \add are\add* the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came
forth out of Egypt, 
\v 46  On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor,
in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come
forth out of Egypt: 
\v 47  And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan,
two kings of the Amorites, which \add were\add* on this side Jordan
toward the sunrising;

even unto mount Sion, which \add is\add* Hermon, 
\v 49  And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the
sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,
the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may
learn them, and keep, and do them.\f + \fr 5.1  \ft keep…: Heb. keep to do

\v 2  The \nd LORD\nd* our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

us, \add even\add* us, who \add are\add* all of us here alive this

\v 4  The \nd LORD\nd* talked with you face to face in the mount
out of the midst of the fire, 
\v 5 (I stood between the \nd LORD\nd* and you at that time, to shew
you the word of the \nd LORD\nd*: for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

\v 6 ¶ I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, which brought thee
out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.\f + \fr 5.6

any likeness \add of any thing\add* that \add is\add* in heaven above, or that
\add is\add* in the earth beneath, or that \add is\add* in the waters
beneath the earth: 
\v 9  Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God \add am\add* a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \add generation\add*
of them that hate me, 
\v 10  And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and
keep my commandments. 
\v 11  Thou shalt not take the name of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God in
vain: for the \nd LORD\nd* will not hold \add him\add* guiltless
that taketh his name in vain. 
\v 12  Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the \nd LORD\nd* thy
God hath commanded thee. 
\v 13  Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 
\v 14  But the seventh day \add is\add* the sabbath of the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God: \add in it\add* thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy
son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that \add is\add*
within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.
\v 15  And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and
\add that\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God brought  thee out thence through a
mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God commanded  thee to keep the sabbath day. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother, as the \nd LORD\nd* thy
God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go
well with thee, in the land which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth thee.
\v 17  Thou shalt not kill. 
\v 18  Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 
\v 19  Neither shalt thou steal. 
\v 20  Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
\v 21  Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt thou
covet thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his

thy neighbour’s. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ These words the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto all your assembly
in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote
them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. 
\p
\v 23  And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came

\v 24  And ye said, Behold, the \nd LORD\nd* our God hath shewed

man, and he liveth. 
\v 25  Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will

\v 28  And the \nd LORD\nd* heard the voice of your words, when ye

\v 29  O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their
children for ever! 
\v 30  Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. 
\v 31  But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the

teach them, that they may do \add them\add* in the land which I give
them to possess it. 
\v 32  Ye shall observe to do therefore as the \nd LORD\nd* your

or to the left.

\v 3 ¶ Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do \add it;\add*
that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily,
as the \nd LORD\nd* God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the

\v 6  And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine

to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou
buildedst not, 
\v 11  And houses full of all good \add things\add*, which thou filledst

trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be

you) lest the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God be kindled against thee, and

\v 16 ¶ Ye shall not tempt the \nd LORD\nd* your God, as ye tempted
\add him\add* in Massah.

\v 17  Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*

\v 21  Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen
in Egypt; and the \nd LORD\nd* brought us out of Egypt with a mighty

upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our

\v 23  And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us

to fear the \nd LORD\nd* our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us
alive, as \add it is\add* at this day. 
\v 25  And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all

\v 1  When the \nd LORD\nd* thy God shall bring thee into the land
whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites,
and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 
\v 2  And when the \nd LORD\nd* thy God shall deliver them before

make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: 
\v 3  Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not
give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
\v 4  For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may
serve other gods: so will the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* be kindled
against you, and destroy thee suddenly. 
\v 5  But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,
and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn
their graven images with fire.\f + \fr 7.5  \ft their images: Heb. their statues, or,

\v 6 For thou \add art\add* an holy people unto the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God: the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath chosen thee to be a special
people unto himself, above all people that \add are\add* upon the
face of the earth. 
\v 7  The \nd LORD\nd* did not set his love upon you, nor choose
you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye \add were\add*
the fewest of all people: 
\v 8  But because the \nd LORD\nd* loved you, and because he would
keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the \nd LORD\nd*
brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house
of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
\v 9  Know therefore that the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, he \add is\add*
God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that
love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; 
\v 10  And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay
him to his face. 
\v 11  Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes,
and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments,

\v 14  Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be

\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* will take away from thee all sickness,
and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,

\v 1  All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess
the land which the \nd LORD\nd* sware unto your fathers. 
\v 2  And thou shalt remember all the way which the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee,
\add and\add* to prove thee, to know what \add was\add* in thine
heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. 
\v 3  And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with
manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee
know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every \add word\add*
that proceedeth out of the mouth of the \nd LORD\nd* doth man live.
\v 4  Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,
these forty years. 
\v 5  Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
 his son, \add so\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God chasteneth thee.
\v 6  Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
\v 7  For the \nd LORD\nd* thy God bringeth thee into a good land,
a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out
of valleys and hills;

pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;\f + \fr 8.8  \ft of oil…: Heb. of olive tree of

\p
\v 10  When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the

\v 11  Beware that thou forget not the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, in not
keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I
command thee this day: 
\v 12 Lest \add when\add* thou hast eaten and art full, and hast
built goodly houses, and dwelt \add therein;\add* 
\v 13 And \add when\add* thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy
silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
\v 14  Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the
house of bondage; 
\v 15  Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, \add wherein
were\add* fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where \add there
was\add* no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of
flint; 
\v 16  Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers
knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee
good at thy latter end; 
\v 17  And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of \add mine\add*
hand hath gotten me this wealth. 
\v 18  But thou shalt remember the \nd LORD\nd* thy God: for \add it
is\add* he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish
his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as \add it is\add*
this day. 
\v 19  And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I
testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. 
\v 20  As the nations which the \nd LORD\nd* destroyeth before your

\v 1  Hear, O Israel: Thou \add art\add* to pass over Jordan this

stand before the children of Anak! 
\v 3  Understand therefore this day, that the \nd LORD\nd* thy God
\add is\add* he which goeth over before thee; \add as\add* a consuming
fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy
face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the

\v 4  Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness
the \nd LORD\nd* hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the
wickedness of these nations the \nd LORD\nd* doth drive them out
from before thee. 
\v 5  Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness
of these nations the \nd LORD\nd* thy God doth drive them out from
before thee, and that he may perform the word which the \nd LORD\nd*
sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
\v 6  Understand therefore, that the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth
thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
\add art\add* a stiffnecked people. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Remember, \add and\add* forget not, how thou provokedst the

out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been
rebellious against the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 8  Also in Horeb ye provoked the \nd LORD\nd* to wrath, so that the
\nd LORD\nd* was angry with you to have destroyed you. 
\v 9  When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
stone, \add even\add* the tables of the covenant which the \nd LORD\nd*
made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights,
I neither did eat bread nor drink water: 
\v 10  And the \nd LORD\nd* delivered  unto me two tables of stone
written with the finger of God; and on them \add was written\add*
according to all the words, which the \nd LORD\nd* spake with you in the
mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 
\v 11  And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
\add that\add* the \nd LORD\nd* gave me the two tables of stone,
\add even\add* the tables of the covenant. 
\v 12  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly
from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt
have corrupted \add themselves;\add* they are quickly turned aside
out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten
image. 
\v 13  Furthermore the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto me, saying, I have
seen this people, and, behold, it \add is\add* a stiffnecked people:
\v 14  Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their
name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
and greater than they. 
\v 15  So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
with fire: and the two tables of the covenant \add were\add* in my
two hands. 
\v 16  And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*
your God, \add and\add* had made you a molten calf: ye had turned
aside quickly out of the way which the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded you.
\v 17  And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
and brake them before your eyes. 
\v 18  And I fell down before the \nd LORD\nd*, as at the first,
forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the
sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to provoke him to anger. 
\v 19  For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the
\nd LORD\nd* was wroth against you to destroy you. But the \nd LORD\nd*
hearkened unto me at that time also. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed
him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
\v 21  And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt
it with fire, and stamped it, \add and\add* ground \add it\add* very
small, \add even\add* until it was as small as dust: and I cast the
dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. 
\v 22  And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the
\nd LORD\nd* to wrath. 
\v 23  Likewise when the \nd LORD\nd* sent you from Kadesh-barnea,
saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
rebelled against the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and ye
believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. 
\v 24  Ye have been rebellious against the \nd LORD\nd* from the
day that I knew you. 
\v 25  Thus I fell down before the \nd LORD\nd* forty days and forty
nights, as I fell down \add at the first;\add* because the \nd LORD\nd*
had said he would destroy you. 
\v 26  I prayed therefore unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, O Lord
\nd GOD\nd*, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of
Egypt with a mighty hand. 
\v 27  Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the
stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their
sin: 
\v 28  Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
\nd LORD\nd* was not able to bring them into the land which he promised
them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay
them in the wilderness. 
\v 29 Yet they \add are\add* thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  At that time the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Hew thee two tables
of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
and make thee an ark of wood. 
\v 2  And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first
tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
\v 3  And I made an ark \add of\add* shittim wood, and hewed two
tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount,
having the two tables in mine hand. 
\v 4  And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
the ten commandments, which the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto you in the
mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the
\nd LORD\nd* gave them unto me.\f + \fr 10.4  \ft commandments: Heb.

\v 5  And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded me. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of
Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and
Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead. 
\v 7  From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ At that time the \nd LORD\nd* separated the tribe of Levi,
to bear the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, to stand before
the \nd LORD\nd* to minister unto him, and to bless in his name,
unto this day. 
\v 9  Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* his inheritance, according as the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God promised him. 
\v 10  And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
days and forty nights; and the \nd LORD\nd* hearkened unto me at that
time also, \add and\add* the \nd LORD\nd* would not destroy thee.\f + \fr 10.10 
\ft first…: or, former days\f* 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Arise, take \add thy\add*
journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land,
which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.\f + \fr 10.11 
\ft take…: Heb. go in journey\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And now, Israel, what doth the \nd LORD\nd* thy God require
 of thee, but to fear the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, to walk in all his
ways, and to love him, and to serve the \nd LORD\nd* thy God with all thy
heart and with all thy soul, 
\v 13  To keep the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*, and his statutes,
which I command thee this day for thy good? 
\v 14  Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens \add is\add*
the \nd LORD’s\nd* thy God, the earth \add also\add*, with all that therein
\add is\add*. 
\v 15  Only the \nd LORD\nd* had a delight in thy fathers to love
them, and he chose their seed after them, \add even\add* you above all
people, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 16  Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
stiffnecked. 
\v 17  For the \nd LORD\nd* your God \add is\add* God of gods, and
Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth
not persons, nor taketh reward: 
\v 18  He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow,
and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 
\v 19  Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
land of Egypt. 
\v 20  Thou shalt fear the \nd LORD\nd* thy God; him shalt thou serve,
and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. 
\v 21 He \add is\add* thy praise, and he \add is\add* thy God, that hath
done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have
seen. 
\v 22  Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
and now the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven
for multitude. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Therefore thou shalt love the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and keep
his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments,
alway. 
\v 2  And know ye this day: for \add I speak\add* not with your children
which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the
\nd LORD\nd* your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched
out arm, 
\v 3  And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 
\v 4  And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses,
and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow
them as they pursued after you, and \add how\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
hath destroyed them unto this day; 
\v 5  And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this
place; 
\v 6  And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,
the son of Reuben: how the earth opened  her mouth, and swallowed them
up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that
\add was\add* in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:\f + \fr 11.6 
\ft substance…: or, living substance which followed them\f*\f + \fr 11.6 
\ft was…: Heb. was at their feet\f* 
\v 7  But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the \nd LORD\nd*
which he did. 
\p
\v 8  Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command
you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,
whither ye go to possess it; 
\v 9  And that ye may prolong \add your\add* days in the land, which the
\nd LORD\nd* sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their
seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, \add is\add*
not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
thy seed, and wateredst \add it\add* with thy foot, as a garden of
herbs: 
\v 11  But the land, whither ye go to possess it, \add is\add* a
land of hills and valleys, \add and\add* drinketh water of the rain
of heaven: 
\v 12  A land which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God careth for: the eyes

unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the \nd LORD\nd*
your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your
soul, 
\v 14  That I will give \add you\add* the rain of your land in his due
season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather
in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
\v 15  And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest
eat and be full.\f + \fr 11.15  \ft send: Heb. give\f* 
\v 16  Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived,
and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
\v 17 And \add then\add* the \nd LORD’s\nd* wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her
fruit; and \add lest\add* ye perish quickly from off the good land
which the \nd LORD\nd* giveth you. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your
soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as
frontlets between your eyes. 
\v 19  And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou
sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou
liest down, and when thou risest up. 
\v 20  And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
and upon thy gates: 
\v 21  That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,
in the land which the \nd LORD\nd* sware unto your fathers to give
them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
command you, to do them, to love the \nd LORD\nd* your God, to walk
in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; 
\v 23  Then will the \nd LORD\nd* drive out all these nations from
before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
\v 24  Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the
wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the
uttermost sea shall your coast be. 
\v 25  There shall no man be able to stand before you: \add for\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread
of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.
\p
\v 26 ¶ Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;
\v 27  A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*
your God, which I command you this day: 
\v 28  And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*
your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this
day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. 
\v 29  And it shall come to pass, when the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath brought thee
in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt
put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
\v 30  \add Are\add* they not on the other side Jordan, by the way
where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell
in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
\v 31  For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land
which the \nd LORD\nd* your God giveth  you, and ye shall possess
it, and dwell therein. 
\v 32  And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments
which I set before you this day.

\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* the statutes and judgments, which ye shall

\v 6  And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows,
and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your

\v 7  And there ye shall eat before the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and ye shall

wherein the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath blessed thee. 
\v 8  Ye shall not do after all \add the things\add* that we do here this

\v 9  For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,

\v 10 But \add when\add* ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land
which the \nd LORD\nd* your God giveth you to inherit, and \add when\add*
he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye

\v 13  Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
in every place that thou seest:

\v 1  At the end of \add every\add* seven years thou shalt make a

and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

\v 7 ¶ If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
any of thy gates in thy land which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth

\v 15  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
of Egypt, and the \nd LORD\nd* thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
command thee this thing to day. 
\v 16  And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he
loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 
\v 17  Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust \add it\add* through his

\v 1  Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the \nd LORD\nd*

thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the \nd LORD\nd*

all the days of thy life.

\v 15  Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God in the place which the \nd LORD\nd* shall choose: because the

\p
\v 16 ¶ Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the

of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast
of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the \nd LORD\nd*

and they shall judge the people with just judgment. 
\v 19  Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,

\p
\v 1  Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God \add any\add*

his covenant, 
\v 3  And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the

death be put to death; \add but\add* at the mouth of one witness
he shall not be put to death. 
\v 7  The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to
death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put
the evil away from among you.

\v 8 ¶ If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke,
\add being\add* matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou
arise, and get thee up into the place which the \nd LORD\nd* thy

that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of \add that which

\v 17  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, They have well \add spoken
that\add* which they have spoken. 
\v 18  I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren,
like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
speak unto them all that I shall command him. 
\v 19 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whosoever will not
hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
\add it\add* of him. 
\v 20  But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my
name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak
in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. 
\v 21  And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
which the \nd LORD\nd* hath not spoken?

\v 8  And the \nd LORD\nd* brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty
hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness,
and with signs, and with wonders: 
\v 9  And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this
land, \add even\add* a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
\v 10  And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
which thou, O \nd LORD\nd*, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
before the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and worship before the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God: 
\v 11  And thou shalt rejoice in every good \add thing\add* which the

thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that \add is\add* among you.

\v 12 ¶ When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
increase the third year, \add which is\add* the year of tithing,
and hast given \add it\add* unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless,
and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;
\v 13  Then thou shalt say before the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, I have brought
away the hallowed things out of \add mine\add* house, and also have
given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless,
and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast
commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I
forgotten \add them:\add* 
\v 14  I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
away \add ought\add* thereof for \add any\add* unclean \add use\add*,

\v 15  Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless
thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou

\p
\v 16 ¶ This day the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath commanded thee to
do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do
them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 
\v 17  Thou hast avouched the \nd LORD\nd* this day to be thy God,
and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments,

\v 18  And the \nd LORD\nd* hath avouched thee this day to be his

\c 27  
\p
\v 1  And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded  the people,
saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. 
\v 2  And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the
land which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee
up great stones, and plaister them with plaister: 
\v 3  And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed
over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God giveth  thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the

\v 4  Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, \add that\add*
ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount

rejoice before the \nd LORD\nd* thy God. 
\v 8  And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this

\p
\v 9 ¶ And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become
the people of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God. 
\v 10  Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* thy

when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar,

\v 8  And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the

his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy
children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; 
\v 3  That then the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will turn thy captivity,
and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the
nations, whither the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath scattered thee. 
\v 4 If \add any\add* of thine be driven out unto the outmost \add parts\add*
of heaven, from thence will the \nd LORD\nd* thy God gather  thee, and from thence will he
fetch thee: 
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will bring thee into the land
which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee
good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. 
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
heart of thy seed, to love the \nd LORD\nd* thy God with all thine
heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. 
\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will put all these curses upon thine
enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee. 
\v 8  And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and do all his commandments which I command thee this day. 
\v 9  And the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will make thee plenteous in every
work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the \nd LORD\nd*
will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:
\v 10  If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* thy
God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written
in this book of the law, \add and\add* if thou turn unto the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ For this commandment which I command thee this day, it \add is\add*
not hidden from thee, neither \add is\add* it far off. 
\v 12 It \add is\add* not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and
do it? 
\v 13 Neither \add is\add* it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest
say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may
hear it, and do it? 
\v 14  But the word \add is\add* very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth,
and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
and evil; 
\v 16  In that I command thee this day to love the \nd LORD\nd* thy
God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes
and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\v 17  But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear,
but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
\v 18  I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,
\add and that\add* ye shall not prolong \add your\add* days upon the
land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it. 
\v 19  I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, \add that\add*
I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 
\v 20  That thou mayest love the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, \add and\add*
that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
\add is\add* thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
dwell in the land which the \nd LORD\nd* sware unto thy fathers,
to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1  And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
\v 2  And he said unto them, I \add am\add* an hundred and twenty
years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the \nd LORD\nd*
hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
\v 3  The \nd LORD\nd* thy God, he will go over before thee, \add and\add*
he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them:
\add and\add* Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the \nd LORD\nd*
hath said. 
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall do unto them as he did to Sihon
and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
destroyed. 
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall give them up before your face, that ye may
do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.
\v 6  Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
them: for the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, he \add it is\add* that doth
go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go
with this people unto the land which the \nd LORD\nd* hath sworn
unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
\v 8  And the \nd LORD\nd*, he \add it is\add* that doth go before
thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake
thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and unto all the elders of Israel. 
\v 10  And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of \add every\add*
seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
of tabernacles, 
\v 11  When all Israel is come to appear before the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this
law before all Israel in their hearing. 
\v 12  Gather the people together, men, and women, and children,
and thy stranger that \add is\add* within thy gates, that they may
hear, and that they may learn, and fear the \nd LORD\nd* your God,
and observe to do all the words of this law: 
\v 13 And \add that\add* their children, which have not known \add any
thing\add*, may hear, and learn to fear the \nd LORD\nd* your God,
as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach
that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle
of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and
Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  in the tabernacle in a pillar
of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
tabernacle. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt
sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go \add to
be\add* among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
made with them.\f + \fr 31.16  \ft sleep: Heb. lie down\f* 
\v 17  Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be
devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will
say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God
\add is\add* not among us?\f + \fr 31.17  \ft befall: Heb. find\f*
\v 18  And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other
gods. 
\v 19  Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a
witness for me against the children of Israel. 
\v 20  For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have
eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto
other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
\v 21  And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I
know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have
brought them into the land which I sware.\f + \fr 31.21  \ft against: Heb.

\p
\v 22 ¶ Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught
it the children of Israel. 
\v 23  And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong
and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel
into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing
the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 
\v 25  That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, 
\v 26  Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, that it may be there for a
witness against thee. 
\v 27  For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet
alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the \nd LORD\nd*;
and how much more after my death? 
\p
\v 28 ¶ Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth
to record against them. 
\v 29  For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt \add yourselves\add*,
and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil
will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the
sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to provoke him to anger through the work
of your hands. 
\v 30  And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
the words of this song, until they were ended. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1  Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
the words of my mouth. 
\v 2  My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil
as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers
upon the grass: 
\v 3  Because I will publish the name of the \nd LORD\nd*: ascribe

\v 4  \add He is\add* the Rock, his work \add is\add* perfect: for all his

was\add* no strange god with him. 
\v 13  He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might

rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of

\add which\add* made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\v 16  They provoked him to jealousy with strange \add gods\add*,

\v 26  I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
