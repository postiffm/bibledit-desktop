\mt1 THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO PHILEMON 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy \add our\add*
brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 
\v 2  And to \add our\add* beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
and to the church in thy house: 
\v 3  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ. 
\p
\v 4  I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
\v 5  Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
Jesus, and toward all saints; 
\v 6  That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
\v 7  For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because
the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. 
\v 8  Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
thee that which is convenient, 
\v 9 Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech \add thee\add*, being such an
one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
\v 10  I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in
my bonds: 
\v 11  Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable
to thee and to me: 
\v 12  Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
mine own bowels: 
\v 13  Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have
ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
\v 14  But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should
not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. 
\v 15  For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest
receive him for ever; 
\v 16  Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh,
and in the Lord? 
\v 17  If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
\v 18  If he hath wronged thee, or oweth  \add thee\add* ought, put
that on mine account; 
\v 19  I Paul have written \add it\add* with mine own hand, I will
repay \add it\add*: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto
me even thine own self besides. 
\v 20  Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh
my bowels in the Lord. 
\p
\v 21  Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
that thou wilt also do more than I say. 
\v 22  But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
your prayers I shall be given unto you. 
\p
\v 23  There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
\v 24  Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. 
\v 25  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with your
spirit. Amen. 
\s1 Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus, a servant.
