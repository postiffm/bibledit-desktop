\p
\v 1  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name \add was\add*
Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God,
and eschewed evil. 
\v 2  And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
\v 3  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses,
and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the
men of the east.\f + \fr 1.3  \ft substance: or, cattle\f*\f + \fr 1.3 
\ft household: or, husbandry\f*\f + \fr 1.3  \ft men: Heb. sons\f*
\p
\v 4  And his sons went and feasted \add in their\add* houses, every
one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
drink with them. 
\v 5  And it was so, when the days of \add their\add* feasting were gone
about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the
morning, and offered burnt offerings \add according\add* to the number
of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and
cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.\f + \fr 1.5 
\ft continually: Heb. all the days\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
\nd LORD\nd*, and Satan came also among them.\f + \fr 1.6  \ft Satan: Heb. the
adversary\f*\f + \fr 1.6  \ft among: Heb. in the midst of\f* 
\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then
Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, From going to and fro
in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
\v 8  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, Hast thou considered
my servant Job, that \add there is\add* none like him in the earth,
a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth
evil?\f + \fr 1.8  \ft considered: Heb. set thy heart on\f* 
\v 9  Then Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Doth Job fear
God for nought? 
\v 10  Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work
of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.\f + \fr 1.10 
\ft substance: or, cattle\f* 
\v 11  But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will
curse thee to thy face.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft and he…: Heb. if he curse thee not to thy
face\f* 
\v 12  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath
\add is\add* in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine
hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 1.12 
\ft power: Heb. hand\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And there was a day when his sons and his daughters \add were\add*
eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
\v 14  And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 
\v 15  And the Sabeans fell \add upon them\add*, and took them away;
yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am
escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 16 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and
said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee.\f + \fr 1.16  \ft The fire…: or, A great fire\f*
\v 17 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and
said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the
edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft fell: Heb. rushed\f* 
\v 18 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and
said, Thy sons and thy daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking
wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
\v 19  And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness,
and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young
men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\f + \fr 1.19 
\ft from…: Heb. from aside, etc\f* 
\p
\v 20  Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head,
and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,\f + \fr 1.20  \ft mantle: or,
robe\f* 
\v 21  And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked
shall I return thither: the \nd LORD\nd* gave, and the \nd LORD\nd*
hath taken away; blessed be the name of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.\f + \fr 1.22 
\ft charged…: or, attributed folly to God\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the \nd LORD\nd*, and Satan came also among them to
present himself before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, From going to and fro
in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
\v 3  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, Hast thou considered
my servant Job, that \add there is\add* none like him in the earth,
a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth
evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst
me against him, to destroy him without cause.\f + \fr 2.3  \ft to destroy…: Heb. to swallow him
up\f* 
\v 4  And Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Skin for skin,
yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 
\v 5  But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
and he will curse thee to thy face. 
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Satan, Behold, he \add is\add*
in thine hand; but save his life.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft but: or, only\f*
\p
\v 7 ¶ So went Satan forth from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his
crown. 
\v 8  And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat
down among the ashes. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
integrity? curse God, and die. 
\v 10  But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not
receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was
come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the
Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an
appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
\v 12  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted
up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and
sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
\v 13  So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that \add his\add*
grief was very great. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
\v 2  And Job spake, and said,\f + \fr 3.2  \ft spake: Heb. answered\f*
\v 3  Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night \add in
which\add* it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
\v 4  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard  it from above,
neither let the light shine upon it. 
\v 5  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.\f + \fr 3.5 
\ft stain: or, challenge\f*\f + \fr 3.5  \ft let the…: or, let them terrify it, as those who have a bitter
day\f* 
\v 6 As \add for\add* that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number
of the months.\f + \fr 3.6  \ft let it not be…: or, let it not rejoice among the
days\f* 
\v 7  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
\v 8  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
up their mourning.\f + \fr 3.8  \ft their…: or, leviathan\f* 
\v 9  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look
for light, but \add have\add* none; neither let it see the dawning
of the day:\f + \fr 3.9  \ft the dawning…: Heb. the eyelids of the
morning\f* 
\v 10  Because it shut not up the doors of my \add mother’s\add*
womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 
\p
\v 11  Why died I not from the womb? \add why\add* did I \add not\add*
give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 
\v 12  Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
suck? 
\v 13  For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
slept: then had I been at rest, 
\v 14  With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate
places for themselves; 
\v 15  Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
silver: 
\v 16  Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
\add which\add* never saw light. 
\v 17  There the wicked cease \add from\add* troubling; and there the
weary be at rest.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft weary: Heb. wearied in strength\f*
\v 18  \add There\add* the prisoners rest together; they hear not the
voice of the oppressor. 
\v 19  The small and great are there; and the servant \add is\add*
free from his master. 
\p
\v 20  Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
unto the bitter \add in\add* soul; 
\v 21  Which long for death, but it \add cometh\add* not; and dig
for it more than for hid treasures;\f + \fr 3.21  \ft long: Heb.
wait\f* 
\v 22  Which rejoice exceedingly, \add and\add* are glad, when they can
find the grave? 
\v 23  \add Why is light given\add* to a man whose way is hid, and whom
God hath hedged in? 
\v 24  For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
out like the waters.\f + \fr 3.24  \ft I eat: Heb. my meat\f* 
\v 25  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was
afraid of is come unto me.\f + \fr 3.25  \ft the thing…: Heb. I feared a fear, and it came upon
me\f* 
\v 26  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
yet trouble came. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\v 2  \add If\add* we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?
but who can withhold himself from speaking?\f + \fr 4.2  \ft to…: Heb. a
word\f*\f + \fr 4.2  \ft withhold…: Heb. refrain from words?\f* 
\v 3  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
the weak hands. 
\v 4  Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
strengthened the feeble knees. 
\v 5  But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
thee, and thou art troubled. 
\v 6  \add Is\add* not \add this\add* thy fear, thy confidence, thy
hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 
\p
\v 7  Remember, I pray thee, who \add ever\add* perished, being innocent?
or where were the righteous cut off? 
\v 8  Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness,
reap the same. 
\v 9  By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils
are they consumed.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft by the breath…: that is, by his
anger\f* 
\v 10  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
\v 11  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s
whelps are scattered abroad. 
\p
\v 12  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
a little thereof.\f + \fr 4.12  \ft secretly: Heb. by stealth\f*
\v 13  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
falleth on men, 
\v 14  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones
to shake.\f + \fr 4.14  \ft came…: Heb. met\f*\f + \fr 4.14  \ft all: Heb. the multitude
of\f* 
\v 15  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
stood up: 
\v 16  It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
image \add was\add* before mine eyes, \add there was\add* silence,
and I heard a voice, \add saying\add*,\f + \fr 4.16  \ft there…: or, I heard a still
voice\f* 
\v 17  Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
pure than his maker? 
\v 18  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
charged with folly:\f + \fr 4.18  \ft and his…: or, nor in his angels, in whom he put
light\f* 
\v 19  How much less \add in\add* them that dwell in houses of clay,
whose foundation \add is\add* in the dust, \add which\add* are crushed
before the moth? 
\v 20  They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
ever without any regarding \add it\add*.\f + \fr 4.20  \ft destroyed: Heb. beaten in
pieces\f* 
\v 21  Doth not their excellency \add which is\add* in them go away?
they die, even without wisdom. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the
saints wilt thou turn?\f + \fr 5.1  \ft turn: or, look?\f* 
\v 2  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
one.\f + \fr 5.2  \ft envy: or, indignation\f* 
\v 3  I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed
his habitation. 
\v 4  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
gate, neither \add is there\add* any to deliver \add them\add*. 
\v 5  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out
of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
\p
\v 6  Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
trouble spring out of the ground;\f + \fr 5.6  \ft affliction: or,
iniquity\f* 
\v 7  Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.\f + \fr 5.7 
\ft trouble: or, labour\f*\f + \fr 5.7  \ft sparks…: Heb. the sons of the burning coal lift up to
fly\f* 
\v 8  I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
\v 9  Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
without number:\f + \fr 5.9  \ft unsearchable: Heb. there is no search\f*\f + \fr 5.9 
\ft without…: Heb. till there be no number\f* 
\v 10  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
fields:\f + \fr 5.10  \ft fields: Heb. outplaces\f* 
\v 11  To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
may be exalted to safety. 
\v 12  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
hands cannot perform \add their\add* enterprise.\f + \fr 5.12  \ft their enterprise: or, any
thing\f* 
\v 13  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel
of the froward is carried headlong. 
\v 14  They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday
as in the night.\f + \fr 5.14  \ft meet…: or, run into\f* 
\v 15  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the
hand of the mighty. 
\v 16  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth  her mouth. 
\p
\v 17  Behold, happy \add is\add* the man whom God correcteth: therefore
despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
\v 18  For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands
make whole. 
\v 19  He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no
evil touch thee. 
\v 20  In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
power of the sword.\f + \fr 5.20  \ft power: Heb. hands\f* 
\v 21  Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be
afraid of destruction when it cometh.\f + \fr 5.21  \ft from…: or, when the tongue
scourgeth\f* 
\v 22  At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
\v 23  For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
\v 24  And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle \add shall be\add*
in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.\f + \fr 5.24 
\ft thy tabernacle…: or, peace is thy tabernacle\f*\f + \fr 5.24 
\ft sin: or, err\f* 
\v 25  Thou shalt know also that thy seed \add shall be\add* great,
and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.\f + \fr 5.25  \ft great: or,
much\f* 
\v 26  Thou shalt come to \add thy\add* grave in a full age, like as a shock of
corn cometh in in his season.\f + \fr 5.26  \ft cometh in: Heb. ascendeth\f*
\v 27  Lo this, we have searched it, so it \add is;\add* hear it, and
know thou \add it\add* for thy good.\f + \fr 5.27  \ft for…: Heb. for
thyself\f* 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  But Job answered and said, 
\v 2  Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid
in the balances together!\f + \fr 6.2  \ft laid: Heb. lifted up\f*
\v 3  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my
words are swallowed up.\f + \fr 6.3  \ft my words…: that is, I want words to express my
grief\f* 
\v 4  For the arrows of the Almighty \add are\add* within me, the
poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in
array against me. 
\v 5  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
over his fodder?\f + \fr 6.5  \ft when he…: Heb. at grass?\f* 
\v 6  Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
\add any\add* taste in the white of an egg? 
\v 7 The things \add that\add* my soul refused to touch \add are\add*
as my sorrowful meat. 
\p
\v 8  Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant \add me\add*
the thing that I long for!\f + \fr 6.8  \ft the thing…: Heb. my expectation\f*
\v 9  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let
loose his hand, and cut me off! 
\v 10  Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy
One. 
\v 11 What \add is\add* my strength, that I should hope? and what
\add is\add* mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
\v 12  \add Is\add* my strength the strength of stones? or \add is\add*
my flesh of brass?\f + \fr 6.12  \ft of brass: Heb. brasen?\f* 
\v 13  \add Is\add* not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
\p
\v 14  To him that is afflicted pity \add should be shewed\add* from his
friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.\f + \fr 6.14 
\ft is afflicted: Heb. melteth\f* 
\v 15  My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, \add and\add*
as the stream of brooks they pass away; 
\v 16  Which are blackish by reason of the ice, \add and\add* wherein the
snow is hid: 
\v 17  What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed
out of their place.\f + \fr 6.17  \ft vanish: Heb. are cut off\f*\f + \fr 6.17 
\ft when…: Heb. in the heat thereof\f*\f + \fr 6.17  \ft consumed: Heb.
extinguished\f* 
\v 18  The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,
and perish. 
\v 19  The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
\v 20  They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were
ashamed. 
\v 21  For now ye are nothing; ye see \add my\add* casting down,
and are afraid.\f + \fr 6.21  \ft ye are…: or, ye are like to them: Heb. to
it\f*\f + \fr 6.21  \ft nothing: Heb. not\f* 
\p
\v 22  Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
substance? 
\v 23  Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the
hand of the mighty? 
\v 24  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand
wherein I have erred. 
\v 25  How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
\v 26  Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
desperate, \add which are\add* as wind? 
\v 27  Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig \add a pit\add*
for your friend.\f + \fr 6.27  \ft ye overwhelm: Heb. ye cause to fall
upon\f* 
\v 28  Now therefore be content, look upon me; for \add it is\add*
evident unto you if I lie.\f + \fr 6.28  \ft evident…: Heb. before your
face\f* 
\v 29  Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,
my righteousness \add is\add* in it.\f + \fr 6.29  \ft in it: that is, in this
matter\f* 
\v 30  Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
things?\f + \fr 6.30  \ft my taste: Heb. my palate\f* 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  \add Is there\add* not an appointed time to man upon earth?
\add are not\add* his days also like the days of an hireling?\f + \fr 7.1 
\ft an appointed…: or, a warfare\f* 
\v 2  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
looketh for \add the reward of\add* his work:\f + \fr 7.2  \ft earnestly…: Heb. gapeth
after\f* 
\v 3  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights
are appointed to me. 
\v 4  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the
day.\f + \fr 7.4  \ft the night…: Heb. the evening be measured?\f*
\v 5  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
broken, and become loathsome. 
\v 6  My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent
without hope. 
\p
\v 7  O remember that my life \add is\add* wind: mine eye shall no
more see good.\f + \fr 7.7  \ft shall…: Heb. shall not return\f*\f + \fr 7.7 
\ft see: to see, that is, to enjoy\f* 
\v 8  The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no \add more:\add*
thine eyes \add are\add* upon me, and I \add am\add* not.\f + \fr 7.8 
\ft I am…: that is, I can live no longer\f* 
\v 9  \add As\add* the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
down to the grave shall come up no \add more\add*. 
\v 10  He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
know him any more. 
\v 11  Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
\v 12  \add Am\add* I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
\v 13  When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
complaint; 
\v 14  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through
visions: 
\v 15  So that my soul chooseth strangling, \add and\add* death rather than my
life.\f + \fr 7.15  \ft life: Heb. bones\f* 
\v 16  I loathe \add it;\add* I would not live alway: let me alone;
for my days \add are\add* vanity. 
\p
\v 17 What \add is\add* man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest
set thine heart upon him? 
\v 18 And \add that\add* thou shouldest visit him every morning,
\add and\add* try him every moment? 
\v 19  How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow
down my spittle? 
\v 20  I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver
of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a
burden to myself? 
\v 21  And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away
mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the
morning, but I \add shall\add* not \add be\add*. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2  How long wilt thou speak these \add things\add*? and \add how long
shall\add* the words of thy mouth \add be like\add* a strong wind?
\v 3  Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
\v 4  If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them
away for their transgression;\f + \fr 8.4  \ft for…: Heb. in the hand of their
transgression\f* 
\v 5  If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication
to the Almighty;

\v 23  If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a

\v 31  Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will

\v 1  Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

\v 9  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should

\v 10  Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be

\p
\v 1  Elihu spake moreover, and said, 
\v 2  Thinkest thou this to be right, \add that\add* thou saidst,

\v 9  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make \add the

\v 11  Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us
wiser than the fowls of heaven? 
\v 12  There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
of evil men. 
\v 13  Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
regard it. 
\p
\v 14  Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, \add yet\add*
