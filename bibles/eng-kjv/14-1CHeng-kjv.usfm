\v 39  And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:
for their brethren had prepared for them. 
\v 40  Moreover they that were nigh them, \add even\add* unto Issachar

\p
\v 1  And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
\add and\add* with every leader. 
\v 2  And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If \add it
seem\add* good unto you, and \add that it be\add* of the \nd LORD\nd*

\v 4  And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
\v 5  So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
\v 6  And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, \add that is\add*,
to Kirjath-jearim, which \add belonged\add* to Judah, to bring up
thence the ark of God the \nd LORD\nd*, that dwelleth \add between\add*

\v 10  And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Uzza,
and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he
died before God. 
\v 11  And David was displeased, because the \nd LORD\nd* had made
a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this
day.\f + \fr 13.11  \ft Perez-uzza: that is, The breach of Uzza\f*
\v 12  And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I

\v 13  So David brought not the ark \add home\add* to himself to the
city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the

\v 14  And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his

\c 14  
\p
\v 1  Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber
of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. 
\v 2  And David perceived that the \nd LORD\nd* had confirmed him
king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
people Israel.

\v 8 ¶ And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David
heard \add of it\add*, and went out against them. 
\v 9  And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
of Rephaim. 
\v 10  And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the \nd LORD\nd*
said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 
\v 11  So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then
David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking
forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.\f + \fr 14.11 
\ft Baal-perazim: that is, A place of breaches\f* 
\v 12  And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment,
and they were burned with fire. 
\v 13  And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
valley. 
\v 14  Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not
up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against
the mulberry trees. 
\v 15  And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
tops of the mulberry trees, \add that\add* then thou shalt go out
to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the
Philistines. 
\v 16  David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.\f + \fr 14.16 
\ft Gibeon: also called, Geba\f* 
\v 17  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the \nd LORD\nd*
brought the fear of him upon all nations. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 And \add David\add* made him houses in the city of David, and
prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
\v 2  Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
Levites: for them hath the \nd LORD\nd* chosen to carry the ark of
God, and to minister unto him for ever.\f + \fr 15.2  \ft None…: Heb. It is not to carry the ark of God, but for the

\v 3  And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
up the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* unto his place, which he had prepared for it.
\v 4  And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
\v 5  Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
hundred and twenty:\f + \fr 15.5  \ft brethren: or, kinsmen\f* 
\v 6  Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two

\v 8  Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren
two hundred: 
\v 9  Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:
\v 10  Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
an hundred and twelve. 
\v 11  And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
\v 12  And said unto them, Ye \add are\add* the chief of the fathers
of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, \add both\add* ye and your brethren,
that ye may bring up the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel unto
\add the place that\add* I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 For because ye \add did it\add* not at the first, the \nd LORD\nd*
our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
order. 
\v 14  So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
up the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 15  And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the
word of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
brethren \add to be\add* the singers with instruments of musick,
psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice
with joy. 
\v 17  So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his

brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

\p
\v 25 ¶ So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*
out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. 
\v 26  And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare
the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, that they offered seven
bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 27  And David \add was\add* clothed with a robe of fine linen,
and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah

\v 28  Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the

\p
\v 29 ¶ And it came to pass, \add as\add* the ark of the covenant
of the \nd LORD\nd* came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter
of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:
and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices
and peace offerings before God. 
\v 2  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the

\v 3  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every
one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon \add of

\p
\v 4 ¶ And he appointed \add certain\add* of the Levites to minister
before the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, and to record, and to thank and
praise the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel: 
\v 5  Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth,
and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom:

\v 37 ¶ So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*

\v 2  Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that \add is\add* in thine

\p
\v 3 ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
Nathan, saying, 
\v 4  Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:

saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 
\v 7  Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,

off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name
like the name of the great men that \add are\add* in the earth. 
\v 9  Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant
them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the
children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
\v 10  And since the time that I commanded judges \add to be\add*
over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
Furthermore I tell thee that the \nd LORD\nd* will build thee an
house. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must
go \add to be\add* with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his
kingdom. 
\v 12  He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne

\v 13  I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not

\v 14  But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
\v 15  According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
so did Nathan speak unto David. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And David the king came and sat before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and said, Who \add am\add* I, O \nd LORD\nd* God, and what \add is\add*

\v 18  What can David \add speak\add* more to thee for the honour

\v 24  Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified

\p
\v 1  Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,
and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the
Philistines. 
\v 2  And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants,
\add and\add* brought gifts. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.\f + \fr 18.3 
\ft Hadarezer: or, Hadadezer\f* 
\v 4  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the
chariot \add horses\add*, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.\f + \fr 18.4 
\ft seven…: or, seven hundred\f* 
\v 5  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\f + \fr 18.5 
\ft Damascus: Heb. Darmesek\f* 
\v 6  Then David put \add garrisons\add* in Syria-damascus; and the
Syrians became David’s servants, \add and\add* brought gifts. Thus the
\nd LORD\nd* preserved David whithersoever he went. 
\v 7  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8  Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen
sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.\f + \fr 18.8  \ft Tibhath…: called in the book of Samuel Betah, and

\p
\v 9 ¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the
host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;\f + \fr 18.9  \ft Tou: also called,
Toi\f* 
\v 10  He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare,
and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer,
and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and \add with
him\add* all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.\f + \fr 18.10 
\ft Hadoram: also called, Joram\f*\f + \fr 18.10  \ft to enquire…: or, to

\p
\v 11 ¶ Them also king David dedicated unto the \nd LORD\nd*, with the
silver and the gold that he brought from all \add these\add* nations;
from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the
Philistines, and from Amalek. 
\v 12  Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
valley of salt eighteen thousand.\f + \fr 18.12  \ft Abishai: Heb.

\p
\v 13 ¶ And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
David’s servants. Thus the \nd LORD\nd* preserved David whithersoever he
went. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
justice among all his people. 
\v 15  And Joab the son of Zeruiah \add was\add* over the host; and
Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.\f + \fr 18.15  \ft recorder: or,

\v 16  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
\add were\add* the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;\f + \fr 18.16 
\ft Abimelech: also called, Ahimelech\f*\f + \fr 18.16  \ft Shavsha: also called Seraiah or

\v 17  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \add was\add* over the Cherethites
and the Pelethites; and the sons of David \add were\add* chief about
the king.\f + \fr 18.17  \ft about…: Heb. at the hand of the king\f*
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2  And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent
messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants
of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to
comfort him. 
\v 3  But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest
thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters
unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to
overthrow, and to spy out the land?\f + \fr 19.3  \ft Thinkest…: Heb. In thine eyes doth David,
etc\f* 
\v 4  Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut
off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them
away. 
\v 5  Then there went \add certain\add*, and told David how the men
were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed.
And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and
\add then\add* return. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand
talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia,
and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.\f + \fr 19.6  \ft odious: Heb. to
stink\f* 
\v 7  So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the
children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities,
and came to battle. 
\v 8  And when David heard \add of it\add*, he sent Joab, and all the
host of the mighty men. 
\v 9  And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come \add were\add*
by themselves in the field. 
\v 10  Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put \add them\add*
in array against the Syrians.\f + \fr 19.10  \ft the battle…: Heb. the face of the battle
was\f*\f + \fr 19.10  \ft choice: or, young men\f* 
\v 11  And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai
his brother, and they set \add themselves\add* in array against the
children of Ammon.\f + \fr 19.11  \ft Abishai: Heb. Abshai\f* 
\v 12  And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt
help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will
help thee. 
\v 13  Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly
for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the \nd LORD\nd*
do \add that which is\add* good in his sight. 
\v 14  So Joab and the people that \add were\add* with him drew nigh
before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. 
\v 15  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the
city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that
\add were\add* beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the
host of Hadarezer \add went\add* before them.\f + \fr 19.16  \ft river: that is,
Euphrates\f*\f + \fr 19.16  \ft Shophach: also called, Shobach\f*
\v 17  And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
over Jordan, and came upon them, and set \add the battle\add* in
array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against
the Syrians, they fought with him. 
\v 18  But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
Syrians seven thousand \add men which fought in\add* chariots, and
forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
\v 19  And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants:
neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the
time that kings go out \add to battle\add*, Joab led forth the power
of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab
smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.\f + \fr 20.1  \ft after…: Heb. at the return of the
year\f* 
\v 2  And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
found it to weigh a talent of gold, and \add there were\add* precious
stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also
exceeding much spoil out of the city.\f + \fr 20.2  \ft to weigh: Heb. the weight

\v 3  And he brought out the people that \add were\add* in it, and
cut \add them\add* with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with
axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of
Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew
Sippai, \add that was\add* of the children of the giant: and they were
subdued.\f + \fr 20.4  \ft arose: or, continued: Heb. stood\f*\f + \fr 20.4

\v 5  And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the

spear staff \add was\add* like a weaver’s beam.\f + \fr 20.5  \ft Jair: also called,
Jaare-oregim\f* 
\v 6  And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of \add great\add*

\add on each hand\add*, and six \add on each foot:\add* and he also was the

\ft the son…: Heb. born to the giant, or, Rapha\f* 
\v 7  But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s

\ft Shimea: also called Shammah\f* 
\v 8  These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the
hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1  And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
Israel. 
\v 2  And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may
know \add it\add*. 
\v 3  And Joab answered, The \nd LORD\nd* make his people an hundred
times so many more as they \add be:\add* but, my lord the king, \add are\add*
they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of
trespass to Israel? 
\v 4  Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
\add they of\add* Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
thousand men that drew sword: and Judah \add was\add* four hundred
threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. 
\v 6  But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s
word was abominable to Joab. 
\p
\v 7  And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
Israel.\f + \fr 21.7  \ft And…: Heb. And it was evil in the eyes of the
\+nd LORD\+nd* concerning this thing\f* 
\v 8  And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy
servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,
\v 10  Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I
offer thee three \add things:\add* choose thee one of them, that I may
do \add it\add* unto thee.\f + \fr 21.10  \ft offer: Heb. stretch

\v 11  So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
Choose thee\f + \fr 21.11  \ft Choose…: Heb. Take to thee\f* 
\v 12  Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed
before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh
\add thee;\add* or else three days the sword of the \nd LORD\nd*,
even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*
destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise
thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. 
\v 13  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
now into the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*; for very great \add are\add*
his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.\f + \fr 21.13 
\ft very great: or, very many\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ So the \nd LORD\nd* sent pestilence upon Israel: and there
fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
\v 15  And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was
destroying, the \nd LORD\nd* beheld, and he repented him of the evil,
and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine
hand. And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stood by the threshingfloor
of Ornan the Jebusite.\f + \fr 21.15  \ft Ornan: also called, Araunah\f*
\v 16  And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*
stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders \add of Israel, who
were\add* clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
\v 17  And David said unto God, \add Is it\add* not I \add that\add*
commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned
and done evil indeed; but \add as for\add* these sheep, what have they
done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O \nd LORD\nd* my God, be on me, and on my
father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Gad to say to
David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*
in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 19  And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
name of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 20  And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.\f + \fr 21.20 
\ft And Ornan…: or, When Ornan turned back and saw the angel, then he and his four sons with him hid
themselves\f* 
\v 21  And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went
out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with \add his\add*
face to the ground. 
\v 22  Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of \add this\add*
threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the \nd LORD\nd*:
thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be
stayed from the people.\f + \fr 21.22  \ft Grant: Heb. Give\f* 
\v 23  And Ornan said unto David, Take \add it\add* to thee, and let my
lord the king do \add that which is\add* good in his eyes: lo, I
give \add thee\add* the oxen \add also\add* for burnt offerings,
and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat
offering; I give it all. 
\v 24  And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the
full price: for I will not take \add that\add* which \add is\add*
thine for the \nd LORD\nd*, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
\v 25  So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
gold by weight. 
\v 26  And David built there an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the
\nd LORD\nd*; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar
of burnt offering. 
\v 27  And the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  the angel; and he put up his
sword again into the sheath thereof. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ At that time when David saw that the \nd LORD\nd* had answered
him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\v 29  For the tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*, which Moses made in the
wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, \add were\add* at that
season in the high place at Gibeon. 
\v 30  But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
afraid because of the sword of the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1  Then David said, This \add is\add* the house of the \nd LORD\nd*
God, and this \add is\add* the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.
\v 2  And David commanded to gather together the strangers that \add were\add*
in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to
build the house of God. 
\v 3  And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance
without weight; 
\v 4  Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 
\v 5  And David said, Solomon my son \add is\add* young and tender,
and the house \add that is\add* to be builded for the \nd LORD\nd*
\add must be\add* exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all
countries: I will \add therefore\add* now make preparation for it. So
David prepared abundantly before his death. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
an house for the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 7  And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
mind to build an house unto the name of the \nd LORD\nd* my God:
\v 8  But the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to me, saying, Thou hast
shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build
an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the
earth in my sight. 
\v 9  Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about:
for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness

\v 10  He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I

\v 11  Now, my son, the \nd LORD\nd* be with thee; and prosper thou, and
build the house of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, as he hath said of thee.
\v 12  Only the \nd LORD\nd* give thee wisdom and understanding,
and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the

\v 13  Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
statutes and judgments which the \nd LORD\nd* charged Moses with concerning
Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
\v 14  Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the
\nd LORD\nd* an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand

\v 16  Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, \add there
is\add* no number. Arise \add therefore\add*, and be doing, and the

\p
\v 17 ¶ David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
his son, \add saying\add*, 
\v 18  \add Is\add* not the \nd LORD\nd* your God with you? and hath he
\add not\add* given you rest on every side? for he hath given the

\v 19  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the \nd LORD\nd*
your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the \nd LORD\nd*
God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the

of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
son king over Israel. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
priests and the Levites. 
\v 3  Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years

and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper
chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place
of the mercy seat, 
\v 12  And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts
of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and of all the chambers round about,
of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated
things:\f + \fr 28.12  \ft of all that…: Heb. of all that was with
him\f* 
\v 13  Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the
work of the service of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and for all the
vessels of service in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 14  \add He gave\add* of gold by weight for \add things\add* of
gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; \add silver also\add*
for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of
service: 
\v 15  Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps
thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, \add both\add*
for the candlestick, and \add also\add* for the lamps thereof, according to the
use of every candlestick. 
\v 16  And by weight \add he gave\add* gold for the tables of shewbread,
for every table; and \add likewise\add* silver for the tables of
silver: 
\v 17  Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
cups: and for the golden basons \add he gave gold\add* by weight
for every bason; and \add likewise silver\add* by weight for every
bason of silver: 
\v 18  And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out
\add their wings\add*, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 19 All \add this, said David\add*, the \nd LORD\nd* made me understand
in writing by \add his\add* hand upon me, \add even\add* all the
works of this pattern. 
\v 20  And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage,
and do \add it:\add* fear not, nor be dismayed: for the \nd LORD\nd*
God, \add even\add* my God, \add will be\add* with thee; he will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work
for the service of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 21  And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, \add even they shall be with
thee\add* for all the service of the house of God: and \add there shall
be\add* with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful
man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people
\add will be\add* wholly at thy commandment. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1  Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, \add is yet\add* young
and tender, and the work \add is\add* great: for the palace \add is\add*
not for man, but for the \nd LORD\nd* God. 
\v 2  Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
the gold for \add things to be made\add* of gold, and the silver for
\add things\add* of silver, and the brass for \add things\add* of
brass, the iron for \add things\add* of iron, and wood for \add things\add*
of wood; onyx stones, and \add stones\add* to be set, glistering
stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones,
and marble stones in abundance. 
\v 3  Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, \add which\add*
I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have
prepared for the holy house, 
\v 4  \add Even\add* three thousand talents of gold, of the gold
of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the houses \add withal:\add* 
\v 5  The gold for \add things\add* of gold, and the silver for \add things\add*
of silver, and for all manner of work \add to be made\add* by the
hands of artificers. And who \add then\add* is willing to consecrate
his service this day unto the \nd LORD\nd*?\f + \fr 29.5  \ft consecrate his service: Heb. fill his
hand\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers
of the king’s work, offered willingly, 
\v 7  And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand
talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents,
and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand
talents of iron. 
\v 8 And they with whom \add precious\add* stones were found gave
\add them\add* to the treasure of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
\v 9  Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the \nd LORD\nd*:
and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Wherefore David blessed the \nd LORD\nd* before all the congregation:
and David said, Blessed \add be\add* thou, \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel
our father, for ever and ever. 
\v 11  Thine, O \nd LORD\nd*, \add is\add* the greatness, and the
power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all \add that
is\add* in the heaven and in the earth \add is thine;\add* thine
\add is\add* the kingdom, O \nd LORD\nd*, and thou art exalted as
head above all. 
\v 12  Both riches and honour \add come\add* of thee, and thou reignest
over all; and in thine hand \add is\add* power and might; and in thine
hand \add it is\add* to make great, and to give strength unto all.
\v 13  Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
name. 
\v 14 But who \add am\add* I, and what \add is\add* my people, that we should
be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things \add come\add*
of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.\f + \fr 29.14  \ft be able: Heb. retain, or, obtain
strength\f*\f + \fr 29.14  \ft of thine…: Heb. of thine hand\f* 
\v 15 For we \add are\add* strangers before thee, and sojourners, as
\add were\add* all our fathers: our days on the earth \add are\add*
as a shadow, and \add there is\add* none abiding.\f + \fr 29.15 
\ft abiding: Heb. expectation\f* 
\v 16  O \nd LORD\nd* our God, all this store that we have prepared
to build thee an house for thine holy name \add cometh\add* of thine
hand, and \add is\add* all thine own. 
\v 17  I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart
I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with
joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.\f + \fr 29.17 
\ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 18  O \nd LORD\nd* God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers,
keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:\f + \fr 29.18 
\ft prepare: or, stablish\f* 
\v 19  And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all \add these
things\add*, and to build the palace, \add for\add* the which I have made
provision. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the \nd LORD\nd*
your God. And all the congregation blessed the \nd LORD\nd* God of their
fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the king. 
\v 21  And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and
offered burnt offerings unto the \nd LORD\nd*, on the morrow after that
day, \add even\add* a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, \add and\add*
a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
for all Israel: 
\v 22  And did eat and drink before the \nd LORD\nd* on that day
with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king
the second time, and anointed \add him\add* unto the \nd LORD\nd*
\add to be\add* the chief governor, and Zadok \add to be\add* priest.
\p
\v 23  Then Solomon sat on the throne of the \nd LORD\nd* as king
instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\v 24  And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.\f + \fr 29.24 
\ft submitted…: Heb. gave the hand under Solomon\f* 
\v 25  And the \nd LORD\nd* magnified  Solomon exceedingly in the
sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him \add such\add* royal majesty
as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
\v 27  And the time that he reigned over Israel \add was\add* forty
years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three \add years\add*
reigned he in Jerusalem. 
\v 28  And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:
and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 29  Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
\add are\add* written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the
book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,\f + \fr 29.29 
\ft book: or, history: Heb. words\f* 
\v 30  With all his reign and his might, and the times that went
over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
