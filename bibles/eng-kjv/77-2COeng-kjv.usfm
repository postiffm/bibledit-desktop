\mt1 THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy
\add our\add* brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth,
with all the saints which are in all Achaia: 
\v 2  Grace \add be\add* to you and peace from God our Father, and
\add from\add* the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3  Blessed \add be\add* God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 
\v 4  Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
we ourselves are comforted of God. 
\v 5  For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ. 
\v 6  And whether we be afflicted, \add it is\add* for your consolation
and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, \add it is\add*
for your consolation and salvation. 
\v 7 And our hope of you \add is\add* stedfast, knowing, that as
ye are partakers of the sufferings, so \add shall ye be\add* also
of the consolation. 
\v 8  For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 
\v 9  But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
\v 10  Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver:
in whom we trust that he will yet deliver \add us\add*; 
\v 11  Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
\add bestowed\add* upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
given by many on our behalf. 
\p
\v 12  For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom,
but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world,
and more abundantly to you-ward. 
\v 13  For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read
or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
\v 14  As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
rejoicing, even as ye also \add are\add* ours in the day of the Lord
Jesus. 
\p
\v 15  And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
that ye might have a second benefit; 
\v 16  And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of
Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
\v 17  When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or
the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that
with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? 
\v 18  But \add as\add* God \add is\add* true, our word toward you
was not yea and nay. 
\v 19  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
by us, \add even\add* by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea
and nay, but in him was yea. 
\v 20  For all the promises of God in him \add are\add* yea, and
in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. 
\v 21  Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed
us, \add is\add* God; 
\v 22  Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
in our hearts. 
\v 23  Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare
you I came not as yet unto Corinth. 
\v 24  Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers
of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again
to you in heaviness. 
\v 2  For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad,
but the same which is made sorry by me? 
\v 3  And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should
have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence
in you all, that my joy is \add the joy\add* of you all. 
\v 4  For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might
know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 
\v 5  But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in
part: that I may not overcharge you all. 
\v 6  Sufficient to such a man \add is\add* this punishment, which
\add was inflicted\add* of many. 
\v 7  So that contrariwise ye \add ought\add* rather to forgive \add him\add*,
and comfort \add him\add*, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed
up with overmuch sorrow. 
\v 8  Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm \add your\add*
love toward him. 
\v 9  For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof
of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 
\v 10  To whom ye forgive any thing, I \add forgive\add* also: for
if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave \add it\add*, for your
sakes \add forgave I it\add* in the person of Christ; 
\v 11  Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant
of his devices. 
\v 12  Furthermore, when I came to Troas to \add preach\add* Christ’s
gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 
\v 13  I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother:
but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 
\v 14  Now thanks \add be\add* unto God, which always causeth us to triumph
in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us
in every place. 
\v 15  For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that
are saved, and in them that perish: 
\v 16  To the one \add we are\add* the savour of death unto death;
and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who \add is\add*
sufficient for these things? 
\v 17  For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but
as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
\add others\add*, epistles of commendation to you, or \add letters\add*
of commendation from you? 
\v 2  Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of
all men: 
\v 3  \add Forasmuch as ye are\add* manifestly declared to be the
epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
of the heart. 
\p
\v 4  And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
\v 5  Not that we are sufficient of ourselves  to think any thing
as of ourselves; but our sufficiency \add is\add* of God; 
\v 6  Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament;
not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but
the spirit giveth life. 
\v 7  But if the ministration of death, written \add and\add* engraven
in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not
stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance;
which \add glory\add* was to be done away: 
\v 8  How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
\v 9  For if the ministration of condemnation \add be\add* glory,
much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
\v 10  For even that which was made glorious had no glory  in this
respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. 
\v 11  For if that which is done away \add was\add* glorious, much
more that which remaineth \add is\add* glorious. 
\v 12  Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
speech: 
\v 13  And not as Moses, \add which\add* put a vail over his face,
that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end
of that which is abolished: 
\v 14  But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth
the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which
\add vail\add* is done away in Christ. 
\v 15  But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
their heart. 
\v 16  Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken
away. 
\v 17  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
\add is\add*, there \add is\add* liberty. 
\v 18  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,
\add even\add* as by the Spirit of the Lord. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
mercy, we faint not; 
\v 2  But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking
in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation
of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight
of God. 
\v 3  But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
\v 4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe
not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
image of God, should shine unto them. 
\v 5  For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
\v 6  For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
hath shined in our hearts, to \add give\add* the light of the knowledge
of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
\p
\v 7  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not of us. 
\v 8  \add We are\add* troubled on every side, yet not distressed;
\add we are\add* perplexed, but not in despair; 
\v 9  Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
\v 10  Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
\v 11  For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’
sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
flesh. 
\v 12  So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
\v 13  We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written,
I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
speak; 
\v 14  Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise
up us also by Jesus, and shall present \add us\add* with you. 
\v 15  For all things \add are\add* for your sakes, that the abundant
grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory
of God. 
\v 16  For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
yet the inward \add man\add* is renewed day by day. 
\v 17  For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
for us a far more exceeding \add and\add* eternal weight of glory;
\v 18  While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
things which are not seen: for the things which are seen \add are\add*
temporal; but the things which are not seen \add are\add* eternal.
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  For we know that if our earthly house of \add this\add* tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens. 
\v 2  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
with our house which is from heaven: 
\v 3  If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
\v 4  For we that are in \add this\add* tabernacle do groan, being
burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
mortality might be swallowed up of life. 
\v 5  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing \add is\add*
God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 
\v 6  Therefore \add we are\add* always confident, knowing that,
whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
\v 7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
\v 8  We are confident, \add I say\add*, and willing rather to be
absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. 
\v 9  Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
be accepted of him. 
\v 10  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
that every one may receive the things \add done\add* in \add his\add*
body, according to that he hath done, whether \add it be\add* good
or bad. 
\p
\v 11  Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;
but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest
in your consciences. 
\v 12  For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to \add answer\add*
them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. 
\v 13  For whether we be beside ourselves, \add it is\add* to God:
or whether we be sober, \add it is\add* for your cause. 
\v 14  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
that if one died for all, then were all dead: 
\v 15  And \add that\add* he died for all, that they which live should
not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
them, and rose again. 
\v 16  Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,
though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know
we \add him\add* no more. 
\v 17  Therefore if any man \add be\add* in Christ, \add he is\add*
a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are
become new. 
\v 18  And all things \add are\add* of God, who hath reconciled us
to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
reconciliation; 
\v 19  To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed
unto us the word of reconciliation. 
\v 20  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
beseech \add you\add* by us: we pray \add you\add* in Christ’s stead,
be ye reconciled to God. 
\v 21  For he hath made him \add to be\add* sin for us, who knew
no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  We then, \add as\add* workers together \add with him\add*,
beseech \add you\add* also that ye receive not the grace of God in
vain. 
\v 2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in
the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now \add is\add*
the accepted time; behold, now \add is\add* the day of salvation.)
\v 3  Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
\v 4  But in all \add things\add* approving ourselves as the ministers
of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
\v 5  In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings,
in fastings; 
\v 6  By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
\v 7  By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
\v 8  By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
deceivers, and \add yet\add* true; 
\v 9  As unknown, and \add yet\add* well known; as dying, and, behold,
we live; as chastened, and not killed; 
\v 10  As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
rich; as having nothing, and \add yet\add* possessing all things.
\p
\v 11 O \add ye\add* Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our
heart is enlarged. 
\v 12  Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your
own bowels. 
\v 13  Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto \add my\add*
children,) be ye also enlarged. 
\v 14  Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
hath light with darkness? 
\v 15  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
believeth with an infidel? 
\v 16  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for
ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell
in them, and walk in \add them\add*; and I will be their God, and
they shall be my people. 
\v 17  Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith
the Lord, and touch not the unclean \add thing\add*; and I will receive
you, 
\v 18  And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God. 
\p
\v 2  Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
we have defrauded no man. 
\v 3  I speak not \add this\add* to condemn \add you\add*: for I have said
before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with \add you\add*.
\v 4  Great \add is\add* my boldness of speech toward you, great
\add is\add* my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding
joyful in all our tribulation. 
\v 5  For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
but we were troubled on every side; without \add were\add* fightings,
within \add were\add* fears. 
\v 6  Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
\v 7  And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith
he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your
mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
\v 8  For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made
you sorry, though \add it were\add* but for a season. 
\v 9  Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that
ye might receive damage by us in nothing. 
\v 10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 
\v 11  For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, \add what\add* clearing of
yourselves, yea, \add what\add* indignation, yea, \add what\add*
fear, yea, \add what\add* vehement desire, yea, \add what\add* zeal,
yea, \add what\add* revenge! In all \add things\add* ye have approved
yourselves to be clear in this matter. 
\v 12  Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, \add I did it\add* not
for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered
wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear
unto you. 
\v 13  Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed
by you all. 
\v 14  For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting,
which \add I made\add* before Titus, is found a truth. 
\v 15  And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling
ye received him. 
\v 16  I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all \add things.\add*
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
on the churches of Macedonia; 
\v 2  How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their
joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
\v 3  For to \add their\add* power, I bear record, yea, and beyond
\add their\add* power \add they were\add* willing of themselves;
\v 4  Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift,
and \add take upon us\add* the fellowship of the ministering to the
saints. 
\v 5  And \add this they did\add*, not as we hoped, but first gave
their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. 
\v 6  Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would
also finish in you the same grace also. 
\v 7  Therefore, as ye abound in every \add thing, in\add* faith,
and utterance, and knowledge, and \add in\add* all diligence, and
\add in\add* your love to us, \add see\add* that ye abound in this
grace also. 
\v 8  I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness
of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
\v 9  For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his
poverty might be rich. 
\v 10  And herein I give \add my\add* advice: for this is expedient
for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward
a year ago. 
\v 11  Now therefore perform the doing \add of it\add*; that as \add there
was\add* a readiness to will, so \add there may be\add* a performance
also out of that which ye have. 
\v 12  For if there be first a willing mind, \add it is\add* accepted
according to that a man hath, \add and\add* not according to that he
hath not. 
\v 13  For \add I mean\add* not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
\v 14 But by an equality, \add that\add* now at this time your abundance
\add may be a supply\add* for their want, that their abundance also
may be \add a supply\add* for your want: that there may be equality:
\v 15  As it is written, He that \add had gathered\add* much had
nothing over; and he that \add had gathered\add* little had no lack.
\v 16  But thanks \add be\add* to God, which put the same earnest
care into the heart of Titus for you. 
\v 17  For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
of his own accord he went unto you. 
\v 18  And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise \add is\add*
in the gospel throughout all the churches; 
\v 19  And not \add that\add* only, but who was also chosen of the
churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered
by us to the glory of the same Lord, and \add declaration of\add*
your ready mind: 
\v 20  Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us: 
\v 21  Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the
Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
\v 22  And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the
great confidence which \add I have\add* in you. 
\v 23  Whether \add any do enquire\add* of Titus, \add he is\add*
my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren \add be enquired of, they
are\add* the messengers of the churches, \add and\add* the glory
of Christ. 
\v 24  Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof
of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
for me to write to you: 
\v 2  For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast
of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and
your zeal hath provoked very many. 
\v 3  Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in
vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 
\v 4  Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same
confident boasting. 
\v 5  Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty,
whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as \add a matter
of\add* bounty, and not as \add of\add* covetousness. 
\v 6  But this \add I say\add*, He which soweth sparingly shall reap
also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
\v 7  Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, \add so let him
give\add*; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful
giver. 
\v 8  And God \add is\add* able to make all grace abound toward you;
that ye, always having all sufficiency in all \add things\add*, may
abound to every good work: 
\v 9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the
poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. 
\v 10  Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread
for \add your\add* food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase
the fruits of your righteousness;) 
\v 11  Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which
causeth through us thanksgiving to God. 
\v 12  For the administration of this service not only supplieth
the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings
unto God; 
\v 13  Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify
God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for
\add your\add* liberal distribution unto them, and unto all \add men\add*;
\v 14  And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the
exceeding grace of God in you. 
\v 15  Thanks \add be\add* unto God for his unspeakable gift. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness
of Christ, who in presence \add am\add* base among you, but being
absent am bold toward you: 
\v 2  But I beseech \add you\add*, that I may not be bold when I am
present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
\v 3  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
\v 4 (For the weapons of our warfare \add are\add* not carnal, but
mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 
\v 5  Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth
itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
\v 6  And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
your obedience is fulfilled. 
\v 7  Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this
again, that, as he \add is\add* Christ’s, even so \add are\add* we
Christ’s. 
\v 8  For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which
the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction,
I should not be ashamed: 
\v 9  That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
\v 10  For \add his\add* letters, say they, \add are\add* weighty
and powerful; but \add his\add* bodily presence \add is\add* weak,
and \add his\add* speech contemptible. 
\v 11  Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
letters when we are absent, such \add will we be\add* also in deed
when we are present. 
\v 12  For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves
with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves
by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not
wise. 
\v 13  But we will not boast of things without \add our\add* measure,
but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed
to us, a measure to reach even unto you. 
\v 14  For we stretch not ourselves beyond \add our measure\add*,
as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you
also in \add preaching\add* the gospel of Christ: 
\v 15  Not boasting of things without \add our\add* measure, \add that
is\add*, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith
is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule
abundantly, 
\v 16  To preach the gospel in the \add regions\add* beyond you,
\add and\add* not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready
to our hand. 
\v 17  But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
\v 18  For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
Lord commendeth. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Would to God ye could bear with me a little in \add my\add*
folly: and indeed bear with me. 
\v 2  For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused
you to one husband, that I may present \add you as\add* a chaste
virgin to Christ. 
\v 3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in Christ. 
\v 4  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have
not preached, or \add if\add* ye receive another spirit, which ye have
not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might
well bear with \add him\add*. 
\v 5  For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
\v 6  But though \add I be\add* rude in speech, yet not in knowledge;
but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
\v 7  Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
\v 8  I robbed other churches, taking wages \add of them\add*, to
do you service. 
\v 9  And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable
to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came
from Macedonia supplied: and in all \add things\add* I have kept
myself from being burdensome unto you, and \add so\add* will I keep
\add myself\add*. 
\v 10  As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
\v 11  Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
\v 12  But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion
from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be
found even as we. 
\v 13  For such \add are\add* false apostles, deceitful workers,
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
\v 14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel
of light. 
\v 15  Therefore \add it is\add* no great thing if his ministers
also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end
shall be according to their works. 
\p
\v 16  I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet
as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
\v 17  That which I speak, I speak \add it\add* not after the Lord,
but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
\v 18  Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
\v 19  For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye \add yourselves\add*
are wise. 
\v 20  For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
\add you\add*, if a man take \add of you\add*, if a man exalt himself,
if a man smite you on the face. 
\v 21  I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold
also. 
\v 22  Are they Hebrews? so \add am\add* I. Are they Israelites?
so \add am\add* I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so \add am\add*
I. 
\v 23  Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I \add am\add*
more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons
more frequent, in deaths oft. 
\v 24  Of the Jews five times received I forty \add stripes\add*
save one. 
\v 25  Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
\v 26  \add In\add* journeyings often, \add in\add* perils of waters,
\add in\add* perils of robbers, \add in\add* perils by \add mine
own\add* countrymen, \add in\add* perils by the heathen, \add in\add*
perils in the city, \add in\add* perils in the wilderness, \add in\add*
perils in the sea, \add in\add* perils among false brethren; 
\v 27  In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
\v 28  Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon
me daily, the care of all the churches. 
\v 29  Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
not? 
\v 30  If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
mine infirmities. 
\v 31  The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
\v 32  In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city
of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
\v 33  And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall,
and escaped his hands. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come
to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
\v 2  I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell:
God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. 
\v 3  And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) 
\v 4  How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
\v 5  Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
but in mine infirmities. 
\v 6  For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool;
for I will say the truth: but \add now\add* I forbear, lest any man
should think of me above that which he seeth me \add to be\add*,
or \add that\add* he heareth of me. 
\v 7  And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
\v 8  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
from me. 
\v 9  And he said unto me, \wj  My grace is sufficient for thee:
for my strength is made perfect in weakness.\wj* Most gladly therefore
will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may
rest upon me. 
\v 10  Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for
when I am weak, then am I strong. 
\p
\v 11  I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for
I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind
the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. 
\v 12  Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
\v 13  For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
except \add it be\add* that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive
me this wrong. 
\v 14  Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will
not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the
children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the
children. 
\v 15  And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though
the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. 
\v 16  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty,
I caught you with guile. 
\v 17  Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
\v 18  I desired Titus, and with \add him\add* I sent a brother.
Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? \add walked
we\add* not in the same steps? 
\v 19  Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak
before God in Christ: but \add we do\add* all things, dearly beloved,
for your edifying. 
\v 20  For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as
I would, and \add that\add* I shall be found unto you such as ye
would not: lest \add there be\add* debates, envyings, wraths, strifes,
backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: 
\v 21  \add And\add* lest, when I come again, my God will humble
me among you, and \add that\add* I shall bewail many which have sinned
already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication
and lasciviousness which they have committed. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  This \add is\add* the third \add time\add* I am coming to you.
In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
\v 2  I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present,
the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have
sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
\v 3  Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward
is not weak, but is mighty in you. 
\v 4  For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth
by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live
with him by the power of God toward you. 
\v 5  Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in
you, except ye be reprobates? 
\v 6  But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
\v 7  Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be
as reprobates. 
\v 8  For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
\v 9  For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
also we wish, \add even\add* your perfection. 
\v 10  Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present
I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath
given me to edification, and not to destruction. 
\p
\v 11  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort,
be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall
be with you. 
\v 12  Greet one another with an holy kiss. 
\p
\v 13  All the saints salute you. 
\v 14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the communion of the Holy Ghost, \add be\add* with you all. Amen.
\s1 The second \add epistle\add* to the Corinthians was written from Philippi,
\add a city\add* of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas.
