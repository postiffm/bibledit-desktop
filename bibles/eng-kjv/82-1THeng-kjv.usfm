\v 1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians
\add which is\add* in God the Father and \add in\add* the Lord Jesus
Christ: Grace \add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 2  We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of
you in our prayers; 
\v 3  Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour
of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight
of God and our Father; 
\v 4  Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. 
\v 5  For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of
men we were among you for your sake. 
\v 6  And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost: 
\v 7  So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia
and Achaia. 
\v 8  For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia
and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread
abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
\v 9  For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we
had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living
and true God; 
\v 10  And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
dead, \add even\add* Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to
come. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
it was not in vain: 
\v 2  But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak
unto you the gospel of God with much contention. 
\v 3  For our exhortation \add was\add* not of deceit, nor of uncleanness,
nor in guile: 
\v 4  But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our
hearts. 
\v 5  For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
nor a cloke of covetousness; God \add is\add* witness: 
\v 6  Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor \add yet\add*
of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of
Christ. 
\v 7  But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
children: 
\v 8  So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have
imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,
because ye were dear unto us. 
\v 9  For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you,
we preached unto you the gospel of God. 
\v 10  Ye \add are\add* witnesses, and God \add also\add*, how holily
and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
\v 11  As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every
one of you, as a father \add doth\add* his children, 
\v 12  That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto
his kingdom and glory. 
\p
\v 13  For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
\add it\add* not \add as\add* the word of men, but as it is in truth,
the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
\v 14  For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God
which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like
things of your own countrymen, even as they \add have\add* of the
Jews: 
\v 15  Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to
all men: 
\v 16  Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them
to the uttermost. 
\p
\v 17  But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your
face with great desire. 
\v 18  Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
again; but Satan hindered us. 
\v 19  For what \add is\add* our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
\add Are\add* not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
at his coming? 
\v 20  For ye are our glory and joy. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
to be left at Athens alone; 
\v 2  And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to
comfort you concerning your faith: 
\v 3  That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves
know that we are appointed thereunto. 
\v 4  For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that
we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
\v 5  For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and
our labour be in vain. 
\v 6  But now when  Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought
us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also
\add to see\add* you: 
\v 7  Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
affliction and distress by your faith: 
\v 8  For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 
\v 9  For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all
the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 
\v 10  Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
\v 11  Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
direct our way unto you. 
\v 12  And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another, and toward all \add men\add*, even as we \add do\add* toward
you: 
\v 13  To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
with all his saints. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort \add you\add*
by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
walk and to please God, \add  so\add* ye would abound more and more.
\v 2  For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
\v 3  For this is the will of God, \add even\add* your sanctification,
that ye should abstain from fornication: 
\v 4  That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel
in sanctification and honour; 
\v 5  Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
know not God: 
\v 6  That no \add man\add* go beyond and defraud his brother in
\add any\add* matter: because that the Lord \add is\add* the avenger
of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. 
\v 7  For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
\v 8  He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 
\v 9  But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 
\v 10  And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and
more; 
\v 11  And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 
\v 12  That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
\add that\add* ye may have lack of nothing. 
\p
\v 13  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have
no hope. 
\v 14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
\v 15  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive \add and\add* remain unto the coming of the Lord
shall not prevent them which are asleep. 
\v 16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the
dead in Christ shall rise first: 
\v 17  Then we which are alive \add and\add* remain shall be caught
up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 
\v 18  Wherefore comfort one another with these words. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
that I write unto you. 
\v 2  For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night. 
\v 3  For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall
not escape. 
\v 4  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief. 
\v 5  Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
\v 6  Therefore let us not sleep, as \add do\add* others; but let us
watch and be sober. 
\v 7  For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night. 
\v 8  But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate
of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
\v 9  For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation
by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
\v 10  Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should
live together with him. 
\v 11  Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
even as also ye do. 
\p
\v 12  And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
\v 13  And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.
\add And\add* be at peace among yourselves. 
\v 14  Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort
the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all \add men\add*.
\v 15  See that none render evil for evil unto any \add man\add*;
but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to
all \add men\add*. 
\v 16  Rejoice evermore. 
\v 17  Pray without ceasing. 
\v 18  In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
Christ Jesus concerning you. 
\v 19  Quench not the Spirit. 
\v 20  Despise not prophesyings. 
\v 21  Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
\v 22  Abstain from all appearance of evil. 
\v 23  And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and \add I pray
God\add* your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 24  Faithful \add is\add* he that calleth you, who also will do
\add it.\add* 
\v 25  Brethren, pray for us. 
\p
\v 26  Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 
\v 27  I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all
the holy brethren. 
\v 28  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you.
Amen. 
\s1 The first \add epistle\add* unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens.
