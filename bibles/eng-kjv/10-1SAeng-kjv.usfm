\p
\v 1  Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim,
and his name \add was\add* Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of
Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 
\v 2  And he had two wives; the name of the one \add was\add* Hannah,
and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
Hannah had no children. 
\v 3  And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add were\add*
there.\f + \fr 1.3  \ft yearly: Heb. from year to year\f* 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
\v 5  But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
but the \nd LORD\nd* had shut up her womb.\f + \fr 1.5  \ft worthy: or,
double\f* 
\v 6  And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
because the \nd LORD\nd* had shut up her womb.\f + \fr 1.6  \ft provoked: Heb.
angered\f* 
\v 7 And \add as\add* he did so year by year, when she went up to the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*, so she provoked her; therefore she wept,
and did not eat.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft when…: or, from the time that she, etc: Heb. from her going
up\f* 
\v 8  Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why
eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? \add am\add* not I
better to thee than ten sons? 
\p
\v 9 ¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the
temple of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 10 And she \add was\add* in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the
\nd LORD\nd*, and wept sore.\f + \fr 1.10  \ft in…: Heb. bitter of
soul\f* 
\v 11  And she vowed a vow, and said, O \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not
forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child,
then I will give him unto the \nd LORD\nd* all the days of his life,
and there shall no razor come upon his head.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft a man…: Heb. seed of
men\f* 
\v 12  And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the \nd LORD\nd*,
that Eli marked her mouth.\f + \fr 1.12  \ft continued…: Heb. multiplied to
pray\f* 
\v 13  Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her
voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought  she had been drunken.
\v 14  And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put
away thy wine from thee. 
\v 15  And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I \add am\add*
a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong
drink, but have poured out my soul before the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 1.15 
\ft of a sorrowful…: Heb. hard of spirit\f* 
\v 16  Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the
abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.\f + \fr 1.16 
\ft complaint: or, meditation\f* 
\v 17  Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
grant \add thee\add* thy petition that thou hast asked of him. 
\v 18  And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.
So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more
\add sad\add*. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
the \nd LORD\nd*, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah:
and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the \nd LORD\nd* remembered her.
\v 20  Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,
\add saying\add*, Because I have asked him of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 1.20 
\ft when…: Heb. in revolution of days\f*\f + \fr 1.20  \ft Samuel: that is, Asked of
God\f* 
\v 21  And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
\nd LORD\nd* the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 
\v 22  But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, \add I will not go
up\add* until the child be weaned, and \add then\add* I will bring
him, that he may appear before the \nd LORD\nd*, and there abide
for ever. 
\v 23  And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the \nd LORD\nd* establish
his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and
brought him unto the house of the \nd LORD\nd* in Shiloh: and the
child \add was\add* young. 
\v 25  And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
\v 26  And she said, Oh my lord, \add as\add* thy soul liveth, my
lord, I \add am\add* the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 27  For this child I prayed; and the \nd LORD\nd* hath given me my
petition which I asked of him: 
\v 28  Therefore also I have lent him to the \nd LORD\nd*; as long as he
liveth he shall be lent to the \nd LORD\nd*. And he worshipped the
\nd LORD\nd* there.\f + \fr 1.28  \ft lent him: or, returned him, whom I have obtained by
petition\f*\f + \fr 1.28  \ft he shall…: or, he whom I have obtained by petition shall be
returned\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the \nd LORD\nd*,
mine horn is exalted in the \nd LORD\nd*: my mouth is enlarged over mine
enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 
\v 2  \add There is\add* none holy as the \nd LORD\nd*: for \add there
is\add* none beside thee: neither \add is there\add* any rock like our
God. 
\v 3  Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let \add not\add* arrogancy
come out of your mouth: for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* a God of
knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.\f + \fr 2.3  \ft arrogancy: Heb.
hard\f* 
\v 4  The bows of the mighty men \add are\add* broken, and they that
stumbled are girded with strength. 
\v 5  \add They that were\add* full have hired out themselves for
bread; and \add they that were\add* hungry ceased: so that the barren
hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
\v 6  The \nd LORD\nd* killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down
to the grave, and bringeth up. 
\v 7  The \nd LORD\nd* maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth
low, and lifteth up. 
\v 8  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, \add and\add* lifteth
up the beggar from the dunghill, to set \add them\add* among princes,
and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
earth \add are\add* the \nd LORD’s\nd*, and he hath set the world upon them.
\v 9  He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. 
\v 10  The adversaries of the \nd LORD\nd* shall be broken to pieces;
out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the \nd LORD\nd* shall
judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his
king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 
\p
\v 11  And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
minister unto the \nd LORD\nd* before Eli the priest. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Now the sons of Eli \add were\add* sons of Belial; they knew
not the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  And the priests’ custom with the people \add was, that\add*,
when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the
flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
\v 14  And he struck \add it\add* into the pan, or kettle, or caldron,
or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they
did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. 
\v 15  Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came,
and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 
\v 16 And \add if\add* any man said unto him, Let them not fail to
burn the fat presently, and \add then\add* take \add as much\add*
as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, \add Nay;\add* but thou shalt
give \add it me\add* now: and if not, I will take \add it\add* by
force.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft presently: Heb. as on the day\f* 
\v 17  Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
\nd LORD\nd*: for men abhorred  the offering of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\p
\v 18 ¶ But Samuel ministered before the \nd LORD\nd*, \add being\add*
a child, girded with a linen ephod. 
\v 19  Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought \add it\add*
to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer
the yearly sacrifice. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The \nd LORD\nd*
give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the \nd LORD\nd*.
And they went unto their own home.\f + \fr 2.20  \ft loan…: or, petition which she asked,
etc\f* 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* visited Hannah, so that she conceived,
and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew
before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled \add at\add*
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\f + \fr 2.22  \ft assembled: Heb. assembled by
troops\f* 
\v 23  And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your
evil dealings by all this people.\f + \fr 2.23  \ft of your…: or, evil words of
you\f* 
\v 24  Nay, my sons; for \add it is\add* no good report that I hear:
ye make the \nd LORD’s\nd* people to transgress.\f + \fr 2.24  \ft transgress: or, cry
out\f* 
\v 25  If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a
man sin against the \nd LORD\nd*, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they
hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the \nd LORD\nd*
would slay them. 
\v 26  And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
\nd LORD\nd*, and also with men. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house? 
\v 28  And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel \add to
be\add* my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to
wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? 
\v 29  Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
commanded \add in my\add* habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves
fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? 
\v 30  Wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel saith, I said indeed
\add that\add* thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk
before me for ever: but now the \nd LORD\nd* saith, Be it far from
me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise
me shall be lightly esteemed. 
\v 31  Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine
house. 
\v 32  And thou shalt see an enemy \add in my\add* habitation, in all
\add the wealth\add* which \add God\add* shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old
man in thine house for ever.\f + \fr 2.32  \ft an enemy…: or, the affliction of the tabernacle, for all the wealth which God
would have given Israel\f* 
\v 33  And the man of thine, \add whom\add* I shall not cut off from mine
altar, \add shall be\add* to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their
age.\f + \fr 2.33  \ft in the flower…: Heb. men\f* 
\v 34 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto thee, that shall come
upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall
die both of them. 
\v 35  And I will raise me up a faithful priest, \add that\add* shall
do according to \add that\add* which \add is\add* in mine heart and in my
mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before
mine anointed for ever. 
\v 36 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every one that is
left in thine house shall come \add and\add* crouch to him for a
piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into
one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.\f + \fr 2.36 
\ft Put: Heb. Join\f*\f + \fr 2.36  \ft one of…: or, somewhat about the
priesthood\f* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And the child Samuel ministered unto the \nd LORD\nd* before
Eli. And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* was precious in those days;
\add there was\add* no open vision. 
\v 2  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli \add was\add* laid
down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, \add that\add*
he could not see; 
\v 3  And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the \nd LORD\nd*,
where the ark of God \add was\add*, and Samuel was laid down \add to
sleep;\add* 
\v 4  That the \nd LORD\nd* called Samuel: and he answered, Here
\add am\add* I. 
\v 5  And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here \add am\add* I; for thou
calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went
and lay down. 
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose
and went to Eli, and said, Here \add am\add* I; for thou didst call
me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. 
\v 7  Now Samuel did not yet know the \nd LORD\nd*, neither was the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* yet revealed unto him.\f + \fr 3.7  \ft Now…: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the
\+nd LORD\+nd*, and before the word of the \+nd LORD\+nd* was revealed unto
him\f* 
\v 8  And the \nd LORD\nd* called Samuel again the third time. And he
arose and went to Eli, and said, Here \add am\add* I; for thou didst
call me. And Eli perceived that the \nd LORD\nd* had called the child.
\v 9  Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he
call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, \nd LORD\nd*; for thy servant
heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
\v 10  And the \nd LORD\nd* came, and stood, and called as at other
times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
heareth. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a
thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth
it shall tingle. 
\v 12  In that day I will perform against Eli all \add things\add*
which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
end.\f + \fr 3.12  \ft when…: Heb. beginning and ending\f* 
\v 13  For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile,
and he restrained them not.\f + \fr 3.13  \ft For I…: or, And I will tell
him\f*\f + \fr 3.13  \ft vile: or, accursed\f*\f + \fr 3.13  \ft restrained…: Heb. frowned not upon
them\f* 
\v 14  And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering
for ever. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
\v 16  Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here
\add am\add* I. 
\v 17  And he said, What \add is\add* the thing that \add the \+nd Lord\+nd*\add*
hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide \add it\add* not from me: God
do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide \add any\add* thing from me of all the
things that he said unto thee.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft more also: Heb. so
add\f*\f + \fr 3.17  \ft thing: or, word\f* 
\v 18  And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
said, It \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: let him do what seemeth him
good.\f + \fr 3.18  \ft every…: Heb. all the things, or, words\f*
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Samuel grew, and the \nd LORD\nd* was with him, and did let none of his
words fall to the ground. 
\v 20  And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel
\add was\add* established  \add to be\add* a prophet of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 3.20 
\ft established: or, faithful\f* 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  again in Shiloh: for the \nd LORD\nd*
revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went
out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer:
and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.\f + \fr 4.1  \ft came: or, came to pass: Heb.
was\f* 
\v 2  And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines:
and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\f + \fr 4.2 
\ft they joined…: Heb. the battle was spread\f*\f + \fr 4.2  \ft army: Heb.
array\f* 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
Israel said, Wherefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* smitten us to day before
the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*
out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save
us out of the hand of our enemies.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft fetch: Heb. take unto
us\f* 
\v 4  So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the
ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, which dwelleth
\add between\add* the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
and Phinehas, \add were\add* there with the ark of the covenant of
God. 
\v 5  And when the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* came into the
camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang
again. 
\v 6  And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
said, What \add meaneth\add* the noise of this great shout in the
camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*
was come into the camp. 
\v 7  And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing
heretofore.\f + \fr 4.7  \ft heretofore: Heb. yesterday, or, the third
day\f* 
\v 8  Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
mighty Gods? these \add are\add* the Gods that smote the Egyptians
with all the plagues in the wilderness. 
\v 9  Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines,
that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
quit yourselves like men, and fight.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft quit…: Heb. be
men\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter;
for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 
\v 11  And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
and Phinehas, were slain.\f + \fr 4.11  \ft were slain: Heb. died\f*
\p
\v 12 ¶ And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came
to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his
head. 
\v 13  And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching:
for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came
into the city, and told \add it\add*, all the city cried out. 
\v 14  And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
\add meaneth\add* the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
and told Eli. 
\v 15  Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were
dim, that he could not see.\f + \fr 4.15  \ft were dim: Heb. stood\f*
\v 16  And the man said unto Eli, I \add am\add* he that came out of the
army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
done, my son?\f + \fr 4.16  \ft is…: Heb. is the thing\f* 
\v 17  And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before
the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the
people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the
ark of God is taken. 
\v 18  And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate,
and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.
And he had judged Israel forty years. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child,
\add near\add* to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that
the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon
her.\f + \fr 4.19  \ft be delivered: or, cry out\f*\f + \fr 4.19 
\ft came: Heb. were turned\f* 
\v 20  And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered
not, neither did she regard \add it\add*.\f + \fr 4.20  \ft neither…: Heb. set not her
heart\f* 
\v 21  And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed
from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in
law and her husband.\f + \fr 4.21  \ft I-chabod: that is, Where is the glory? or, There is no
glory\f* 
\v 22  And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
of God is taken. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. 
\v 2  When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
Dagon \add was\add* fallen upon his face to the earth before the
ark of the \nd LORD\nd*. And they took Dagon, and set him in his
place again. 
\v 4  And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
\add was\add* fallen  upon his face to the ground before the ark
of the \nd LORD\nd*; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his
hands \add were\add* cut off upon the threshold; only \add the stump
of\add* Dagon was left to him.\f + \fr 5.4  \ft the stump…: or, the fishy
part\f* 
\v 5  Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this
day. 
\p
\v 6  But the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was heavy upon them of Ashdod,
and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, \add even\add*
Ashdod and the coasts thereof. 
\v 7  And when the men of Ashdod saw that \add it was\add* so, they
said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his
hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. 
\v 8  They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of
Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried
about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about
\add thither\add*. 
\v 9 And it was \add so\add*, that, after they had carried it about,
the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against the city with a very great
destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great,
and they had emerods in their secret parts. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the
ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought
about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.\f + \fr 5.10 
\ft us, to…: Heb. me to slay me and my\f* 
\v 11  So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines,
and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again
to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a
deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
heavy there.\f + \fr 5.11  \ft us not…: Heb. me not, and my\f* 
\v 12  And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the
cry of the city went up to heaven. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* was in the country of the Philistines
seven months. 
\v 2  And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
saying, What shall we do to the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*? tell us wherewith we shall
send it to his place. 
\v 3  And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering:
then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand
is not removed from you. 
\v 4  Then said they, What \add shall be\add* the trespass offering
which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods,
and five golden mice, \add according to\add* the number of the lords
of the Philistines: for one plague \add was\add* on you all, and on your
lords.\f + \fr 6.4  \ft you: Heb. them\f* 
\v 5  Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images
of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your
gods, and from off your land. 
\v 6  Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people
go, and they departed?\f + \fr 6.6  \ft wonderfully: or, reproachfully\f*\f + \fr 6.6 
\ft the people: Heb. them\f* 
\v 7  Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath
come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves
home from them: 
\v 8  And take the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, and lay it upon the cart;
and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him \add for\add* a trespass
offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may
go. 
\v 9  And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh,
\add then\add* he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall

\v 10 ¶ And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
cart, and shut up their calves at home: 
\v 11  And they laid the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* upon the cart, and the
coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. 
\v 12  And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh,
\add and\add* went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not
aside \add to\add* the right hand or \add to\add* the left; and the
lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
\v 13 And \add they of\add* Beth-shemesh \add were\add* reaping their
wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw
the ark, and rejoiced to see \add it\add*. 
\v 14  And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite,
and stood there, where \add there was\add* a great stone: and they
clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering
unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 15  And the Levites took down the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the
coffer that \add was\add* with it, wherein the jewels of gold \add were\add*,
and put \add them\add* on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh
offered  burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen \add it\add*,
they returned to Ekron the same day. 
\v 17 And these \add are\add* the golden emerods which the Philistines
returned \add for\add* a trespass offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*;
for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for

\p
\v 19 ¶ And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked
into the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, even he smote of the people fifty
thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the
\nd LORD\nd* had smitten \add many\add* of the people with a great
slaughter. 
\v 20  And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before
this holy \nd LORD\nd* God? and to whom shall he go up from us? 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim,
saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*;
come ye down, \add and\add* fetch it up to you. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark
of the \nd LORD\nd*, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 2  And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim,
that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house
of Israel lamented after the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
return unto the \nd LORD\nd* with all your hearts, \add then\add*
put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
your hearts unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and serve him only: and he will
deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 
\v 4  Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
and served the \nd LORD\nd* only. 
\v 5  And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
for you unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
\add it\add* out before the \nd LORD\nd*, and fasted on that day,
and said there, We have sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*. And Samuel
judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 
\p
\v 7  And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went
up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard \add it\add*,
they were afraid of the Philistines. 
\v 8  And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
unto the \nd LORD\nd* our God for us, that he will save us out of the
hand of the Philistines.\f + \fr 7.8  \ft Cease…: Heb. Be not silent from us from
crying\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered \add it for\add*
a burnt offering wholly unto the \nd LORD\nd*: and Samuel cried unto the
\nd LORD\nd* for Israel; and the \nd LORD\nd* heard him.\f + \fr 7.9 
\ft heard: or, answered\f* 
\v 10  And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
drew near to battle against Israel: but the \nd LORD\nd* thundered
with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited
them; and they were smitten before Israel. 
\v 11  And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
Philistines, and smote them, until \add they came\add* under Beth-car.
\v 12  Then Samuel took a stone, and set \add it\add* between Mizpeh
and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
\nd LORD\nd* helped us.\f + \fr 7.12  \ft Eben-ezer: that is, The stone of

\p
\v 13 ¶ So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
coast of Israel: and the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against the
Philistines all the days of Samuel. 
\v 14  And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts
thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was
peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
\v 15  And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
\v 16  And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal,
and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.\f + \fr 7.16 
\ft in circuit: Heb. and he circuited\f* 
\v 17  And his return \add was\add* to Ramah; for there \add was\add*
his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar
unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
sons judges over Israel. 
\v 2  Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
second, Abiah: \add they were\add* judges in Beer-sheba. 
\v 3  And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 
\p
\v 4  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 
\v 5  And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk
not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
\p
\v 6 ¶ But the thing displeased  Samuel, when they said, Give us a
king to judge us. And Samuel prayed  unto the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 8.6 
\ft displeased: Heb. was evil in the eyes of\f* 
\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice
of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
\v 8  According to all the works which they have done since the day
that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have
forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
\v 9  Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest

\v 10 ¶ And Samuel told all the words of the \nd LORD\nd* unto the
people that asked of him a king. 
\v 11  And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint \add them\add*
for himself, for his chariots, and \add to be\add* his horsemen; and
\add some\add* shall run before his chariots. 
\v 12  And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
over fifties; and \add will set them\add* to ear his ground, and to
reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments
of his chariots. 
\v 13  And he will take your daughters \add to be\add* confectionaries, and
\add to be\add* cooks, and \add to be\add* bakers. 
\v 14  And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
oliveyards, \add even\add* the best \add of them\add*, and give \add them\add*

\v 15  And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
and give to his officers, and to his servants.\f + \fr 8.15  \ft officers: Heb.

\v 16  And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants,
and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put \add them\add*
to his work. 
\v 17  He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
servants. 
\v 18  And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have
chosen you; and the \nd LORD\nd* will not hear you in that day. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 
\v 20  That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
\v 21  And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  And the \nd LORD\nd* said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice,
and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
ye every man unto his city. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name \add was\add* Kish,
the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son
of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.\f + \fr 9.1  \ft a Benjamite: or, the son of a man of

\v 2  And he had a son, whose name \add was\add* Saul, a choice young
man, and a goodly: and \add there was\add* not among the children
of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward
\add he was\add* higher than any of the people. 
\p
\v 3  And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said
to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise,
go seek the asses. 
\v 4  And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
land of Shalisha, but they found \add them\add* not: then they passed
through the land of Shalim, and \add there they were\add* not: and he passed
through the land of the Benjamites, but they found \add them\add* not.
\v 5  \add And\add* when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul
said to his servant that \add was\add* with him, Come, and let us
return; lest my father leave \add caring\add* for the asses, and take

\v 6  And he said unto him, Behold now, \add there is\add* in this
city a man of God, and \add he is\add* an honourable man; all that he
saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
shew us our way that we should go. 
\v 7  Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, \add if\add* we

\add there is\add* not a present to bring to the man of God: what have

\v 8  And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have

So they went unto the city where the man of God \add was\add*.\f + \fr 9.10 
\ft Well said: Heb. Thy word is good\f*

\v 12  And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, \add he is\add*

\v 14  And they went up into the city: \add and\add* when they were

\v 15 ¶ Now the \nd LORD\nd* had told Samuel in his ear a day before

\v 18  Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell

\v 22  And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the

\v 23  And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave

\v 20  And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come

\v 21  When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their

\v 9  And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye
say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by \add that time\add*
the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
\add it\add* to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.\f + \fr 11.9 
\ft help: or, deliverance\f* 
\v 10  Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
\v 11 And it was \add so\add* on the morrow, that Saul put the people
in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day:
and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that
two of them were not left together. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the people said unto Samuel, Who \add is\add* he that
said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
death. 
\v 13  And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this
day: for to day the \nd LORD\nd* hath wrought salvation in Israel.
\v 14  Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
and renew the kingdom there. 
\v 15  And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
king before the \nd LORD\nd* in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
sacrifices of peace offerings before the \nd LORD\nd*; and there
Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your
voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
\v 2  And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old
and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons \add are\add* with you: and I have
walked before you from my childhood unto this day. 
\v 3 Behold, here I \add am:\add* witness against me before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I
taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose
hand have I received \add any\add* bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will
restore it you.\f + \fr 12.3  \ft bribe: Heb. ransom\f*\f + \fr 12.3 
\ft to blind…: or, that I should hide mine eyes at him\f* 
\v 4  And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou
taken ought of any man’s hand. 
\v 5  And he said unto them, The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* witness
against you, and his anointed \add is\add* witness this day, that ye have not
found ought in my hand. And they answered, \add He is\add* witness.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Samuel said unto the people, \add It is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
land of Egypt.\f + \fr 12.6  \ft advanced: or, made\f* 
\v 7  Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before

\v 8  When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the
\nd LORD\nd*, then the \nd LORD\nd* sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
\v 9  And when they forgat the \nd LORD\nd* their God, he sold them into the
hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\v 10  And they cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, We have sinned,
because we have forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*, and have served Baalim
and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
and we will serve thee. 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah,
and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every
side, and ye dwelled safe. 
\v 12  And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the
\nd LORD\nd* your God \add was\add* your king. 
\v 13  Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, \add and\add*
whom ye have desired! and, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath set a king over you.
\v 14  If ye will fear the \nd LORD\nd*, and serve him, and obey
his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*,
then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
following the \nd LORD\nd* your God:\f + \fr 12.14  \ft commandment: Heb.

\v 15  But if ye will not obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, but
rebel against the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*, then shall the
hand of the \nd LORD\nd* be against you, as \add it was\add* against your

\p
\v 16 ¶ Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the \nd LORD\nd*
will do before your eyes. 
\v 17  \add Is it\add* not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the
\nd LORD\nd*, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive
and see that your wickedness \add is\add* great, which ye have done
in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, in asking you a king. 
\v 18  So Samuel called unto the \nd LORD\nd*; and the \nd LORD\nd*
sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared
the \nd LORD\nd* and Samuel. 
\v 19  And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
unto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, that we die not: for we have added
unto all our sins \add this\add* evil, to ask us a king. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this
wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the \nd LORD\nd*, but
serve the \nd LORD\nd* with all your heart; 
\v 21  And turn ye not aside: for \add then should ye go\add* after
vain \add things\add*, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they
\add are\add* vain. 
\v 22  For the \nd LORD\nd* will not forsake his people for his great
name’s sake: because it hath pleased the \nd LORD\nd* to make you his
people. 
\v 23  Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the

\v 25  But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your

\c 13  
\p
\v 1  Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
Israel,\f + \fr 13.1  \ft reigned one…: Heb. the son of one year in his

\v 2  Saul chose him three thousand \add men\add* of Israel; \add whereof\add*
two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a
thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the
people he sent every man to his tent. 
\v 3  And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that \add was\add*
in Geba, and the Philistines heard \add of it\add*. And Saul blew
the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.\f + \fr 13.3 
\ft Geba: or, the hill\f* 
\v 4  And all Israel heard say \add that\add* Saul had smitten a

abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together
after Saul to Gilgal.\f + \fr 13.4  \ft was…: Heb. did stink\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight
with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
and people as the sand which \add is\add* on the sea shore in multitude:
and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
\v 6  When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,
and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 
\v 7 And \add some of\add* the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land
of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he \add was\add* yet in Gilgal, and all the
people followed him trembling.\f + \fr 13.7  \ft followed…: Heb. trembled after

\p
\v 8 ¶ And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
Samuel \add had appointed:\add* but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
people were scattered from him. 
\v 9  And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. 
\v 10  And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out
to meet him, that he might salute him.\f + \fr 13.10  \ft salute: Heb.

\p
\v 11 ¶ And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
saw that the people were scattered from me, and \add that\add* thou
camest not within the days appointed, and \add that\add* the Philistines
gathered themselves together at Michmash; 
\v 12  Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to
Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the \nd LORD\nd*: I
forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.\f + \fr 13.12 
\ft made…: Heb. intreated the face\f* 
\v 13  And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
kept the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, which he commanded
thee: for now would the \nd LORD\nd* have established thy kingdom
upon Israel for ever. 
\v 14  But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the \nd LORD\nd* hath
sought him a man after his own heart, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath commanded him
\add to be\add* captain over his people, because thou hast not kept
\add that\add* which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded thee. 
\p
\v 15  And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people \add that were\add* present
with him, about six hundred men.\f + \fr 13.15  \ft present: Heb.

\v 16  And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people \add that were\add*

\p
\v 17 ¶ And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines
in three companies: one company turned unto the way \add that leadeth
to\add* Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 
\v 18  And another company turned the way \add to\add* Beth-horon:
and another company turned \add to\add* the way of the border that
looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:
for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make \add them\add* swords
or spears: 
\v 20  But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
\v 21  Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.\f + \fr 13.21 
\ft a file: Heb. a file with mouths, or Heb. a pim, a third of a

\v 22  So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that \add were\add*
with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there
found. 
\v 23  And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage
of Michmash.\f + \fr 13.23  \ft garrison: or, standing camp\f* 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go
over to the Philistines’ garrison, that \add is\add* on the other
side. But he told not his father.\f + \fr 14.1  \ft it came…: or, there was a

\v 2  And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate
tree which \add is\add* in Migron: and the people that \add were\add* with him
\add were\add* about six hundred men; 
\v 3  And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod’s brother, the son of
Phinehas, the son of Eli, the \nd LORD’s\nd* priest in Shiloh, wearing
an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.\f + \fr 14.3 
\ft Ahiah: called Ahimelech\f* 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
unto the Philistines’ garrison, \add there was\add* a sharp rock
on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name
of the one \add was\add* Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\v 5  The forefront of the one \add was\add* situate northward over
against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.\f + \fr 14.5

\v 6  And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the
\nd LORD\nd* will work for us: for \add there is\add* no restraint
to the \nd LORD\nd* to save by many or by few. 
\v 7  And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that \add is\add*
in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I \add am\add* with thee according to thy
heart. 
\v 8  Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto \add these\add*
men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 
\v 9  If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand
still in our place, and will not go up unto them.\f + \fr 14.9  \ft Tarry: Heb. Be

\v 10  But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up:
for the \nd LORD\nd* hath delivered them into our hand: and this
\add shall be\add* a sign unto us. 
\v 11  And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 
\v 12  And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer,
and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan
said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the \nd LORD\nd*
hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 
\v 13  And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet,
and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew after him. 
\v 14  And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,
\add which\add* a yoke \add of oxen might plow\add*.\f + \fr 14.14

\v 15  And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the

\p
\v 16  And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the
multitude melted away, and they went on beating down \add one another\add*.
\v 17  Then said Saul unto the people that \add were\add* with him,
Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer \add were\add* not \add there\add*.
\v 18  And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
noise that \add was\add* in the host of the Philistines went on and
increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.\f + \fr 14.19 
\ft noise: or, tumult\f* 
\v 20  And Saul and all the people that \add were\add* with him assembled

discomfiture.\f + \fr 14.20  \ft assembled…: Heb. were cried together\f*
\v 21  Moreover the Hebrews \add that\add* were with the Philistines
before that time, which went up with them into the camp \add from the

Israelites that \add were\add* with Saul and Jonathan. 
\v 22  Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
mount Ephraim, \add when\add* they heard that the Philistines fled,
even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 
\v 23  So the \nd LORD\nd* saved Israel that day: and the battle
passed over unto Beth-aven. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul
had adjured the people, saying, Cursed \add be\add* the man that
eateth \add any\add* food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine
enemies. So none of the people tasted \add any\add* food. 
\v 25 And all \add they of\add* the land came to a wood; and there was
honey upon the ground. 
\v 26  And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared
the oath. 
\v 27  But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people
with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that \add was\add*
in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his
mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. 
\v 28  Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed \add be\add* the
man that eateth \add any\add* food this day. And the people were
faint.\f + \fr 14.28  \ft faint: or, weary\f* 
\v 29  Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see,
I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted
a little of this honey. 
\v 30  How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day
of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much
greater slaughter among the Philistines? 
\v 31  And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon:
and the people were very faint. 
\v 32  And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew \add them\add* on the ground: and the people
did eat \add them\add* with the blood. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
\nd LORD\nd*, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.\f + \fr 14.33 
\ft transgressed: or, dealt treacherously\f* 
\v 34  And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
and slay \add them\add* here, and eat; and sin not against the \nd LORD\nd*
in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his

\p
\v 36 ¶ And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man
of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then
said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 
\v 37  And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?
wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that
day. 
\v 38  And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:

\v 40  Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto
Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. 
\v 41  Therefore Saul said unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, Give
a perfect \add lot\add*. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the
people escaped.\f + \fr 14.41  \ft Give…: or, Shew the innocent\f*\f + \fr 14.41

\v 42  And Saul said, Cast \add lots\add* between me and Jonathan

\v 43  Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the
end of the rod that \add was\add* in mine hand, \add and\add*, lo,
I must die. 
\v 44  And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
surely die, Jonathan. 
\v 45  And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: \add as\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall
to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
rescued  Jonathan, that he died not. 
\v 46  Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
Philistines went to their own place. 
\p
\v 47 ¶ So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of
Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the
Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed \add them\add*.

\v 52  And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days
of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
took him unto him. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  Samuel also said unto Saul, The \nd LORD\nd* sent me to anoint thee
\add to be\add* king over his people, over Israel: now therefore
hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, I remember \add that\add*

\v 3  Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and
spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and sheep, camel and ass. 
\v 4  And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\v 5  And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.\f + \fr 15.5

kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of
Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
\v 7  And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah \add until\add*
thou comest to Shur, that \add is\add* over against Egypt. 
\v 8  And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
\v 9  But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all \add that

\v 10 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Samuel, saying,
\v 11  It repenteth me that I have set up Saul \add to be\add* king:
for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*
all night. 
\v 12  And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him
up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
\v 13  And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed \add be\add*

\v 14  And Samuel said, What \add meaneth\add* then this bleating
of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\v 15  And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:
for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice
unto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\v 16  Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the
\nd LORD\nd* hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say

\v 17  And Samuel said, When thou \add wast\add* little in thine own

of Israel, and the \nd LORD\nd* anointed thee king over Israel? 
\v 18  And the \nd LORD\nd* sent thee on a journey, and said, Go
and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be
consumed.\f + \fr 15.18  \ft they…: Heb. they consume them\f* 
\v 19  Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*,
but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 20  And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
\nd LORD\nd*, and have gone the way which the \nd LORD\nd* sent me, and have
brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\v 21  But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice
unto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God in Gilgal. 
\v 22  And Samuel said, Hath the \nd LORD\nd* \add as great\add*
delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice
of the \nd LORD\nd*? Behold, to obey \add is\add* better than sacrifice,
\add and\add* to hearken than the fat of rams. 
\v 23  For rebellion \add is as\add* the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness
\add is as\add* iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected
the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, he hath also rejected thee from \add being\add*
king.\f + \fr 15.23  \ft witchcraft: Heb. divination\f* 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed
the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*, and thy words: because I feared
the people, and obeyed their voice. 
\v 25  Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again
with me, that I may worship the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 26  And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast
rejected the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath
rejected thee from being king over Israel. 
\v 27  And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
skirt of his mantle, and it rent. 
\v 28  And Samuel said unto him, The \nd LORD\nd* hath rent the kingdom
of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,
\add that is\add* better than thou. 
\v 29  And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he
\add is\add* not a man, that he should repent.\f + \fr 15.29  \ft Strength: or, Eternity, or,
Victory\f* 
\v 30  Then he said, I have sinned: \add yet\add* honour me now, I pray thee, before the
elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may
worship the \nd LORD\nd* thy God. 
\v 31  So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely
the bitterness of death is past. 
\v 33  And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy
mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces
before the \nd LORD\nd* in Gilgal. 
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house
to Gibeah of Saul. 
\v 35  And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the \nd LORD\nd* repented
that he had made Saul king over Israel. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn
for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill
thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite:
for I have provided me a king among his sons. 
\v 2  And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear \add it\add*, he will
kill me. And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Take an heifer with thee, and
say, I am come to sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 16.2  \ft with thee: Heb. in thine
hand\f* 
\v 3  And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt
do: and thou shalt anoint unto me \add him\add* whom I name unto thee.
\v 4  And Samuel did that which the \nd LORD\nd* spake, and came
to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled  at his coming,
and said, Comest thou peaceably?\f + \fr 16.4  \ft coming: Heb. meeting\f*
\v 5  And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the \nd LORD\nd*:
sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified
Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
Eliab, and said, Surely the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed \add is\add* before
him.\f + \fr 16.6  \ft Eliab: called Elihu\f* 
\v 7  But the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance,
or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
\add the \+nd Lord\+nd* seeth\add* not as man seeth; for man looketh
on the outward appearance, but the \nd LORD\nd* looketh on the heart.\f + \fr 16.7 
\ft outward…: Heb. eyes\f* 
\v 8  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
And he said, Neither hath the \nd LORD\nd* chosen this. 
\v 9  Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
\nd LORD\nd* chosen this.\f + \fr 16.9  \ft Shammah: Shimeah, also called,
Shimma\f* 
\v 10  Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.
And Samuel said unto Jesse, The \nd LORD\nd* hath not chosen these.
\v 11  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all \add thy\add* children?
And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth
the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit
down till he come hither.\f + \fr 16.11  \ft down: Heb. round\f*
\v 12  And he sent, and brought him in. Now he \add was\add* ruddy,
\add and\add* withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look
to. And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Arise, anoint him: for this \add is\add*
he.\f + \fr 16.12  \ft of a…: Heb. fair of eyes\f* 
\v 13  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came upon
David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* departed from Saul, and an
evil spirit from the \nd LORD\nd* troubled him.\f + \fr 16.14  \ft troubled: or,
terrified\f* 
\v 15  And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
from God troubleth thee. 
\v 16  Let our lord now command thy servants, \add which are\add*
before thee, to seek out a man, \add who is\add* a cunning player
on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from
God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
well. 
\v 17  And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
play well, and bring \add him\add* to me. 
\v 18  Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, \add that is\add* cunning
in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent
in matters, and a comely person, and the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* with
him.\f + \fr 16.18  \ft matters: or, speech\f* 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send
me David thy son, which \add is\add* with the sheep. 
\v 20  And Jesse took an ass \add laden\add* with bread, and a bottle
of wine, and a kid, and sent \add them\add* by David his son unto
Saul. 
\v 21  And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved
him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. 
\v 22  And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, when the \add evil\add* spirit from God
was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand:
so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
and were gathered together at Shochoh, which \add belongeth\add*
to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.\f + \fr 17.1 
\ft Ephes-dammim: or, the coast of Dammim, called Pas-dammim\f* 
\v 2  And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against

\v 3  And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and \add there was\add*
a valley between them. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height \add was\add* six cubits and a
span. 
\v 5 And \add he had\add* an helmet of brass upon his head, and he
\add was\add* armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat
\add was\add* five thousand shekels of brass.\f + \fr 17.5  \ft armed: Heb.

\v 6 And \add he had\add* greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target

\v 7  And the staff of his spear \add was\add* like a weaver’s beam;
and his spear’s head \add weighed\add* six hundred shekels of iron:
and one bearing a shield went before him. 
\v 8  And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
unto them, Why are ye come out to set \add your\add* battle in array?
\add am\add* not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose
you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
\v 9  If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your
servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our
servants, and serve us. 
\v 10  And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this
day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
\v 11  When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Now David \add was\add* the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah,
whose name \add was\add* Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man
went among men \add for\add* an old man in the days of Saul. 
\v 13  And the three eldest sons of Jesse went \add and\add* followed
Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
battle \add were\add* Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
and the third Shammah. 
\v 14  And David \add was\add* the youngest: and the three eldest
followed  Saul. 
\v 15  But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s
sheep at Beth-lehem. 
\v 16  And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
himself forty days. 
\v 17  And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
an ephah of this parched \add corn\add*, and these ten loaves, and
run to the camp to thy brethren; 
\v 18  And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of \add their\add*

\v 19  Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, \add were\add*
in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he
came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and
shouted for the battle.\f + \fr 17.20  \ft trench: or, place of the

\v 21  For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,

\v 22  And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.\f + \fr 17.22 
\ft his carriage: Heb. the vessels from upon him\f*\f + \fr 17.22 
\ft saluted…: Heb. asked his brethren of peace\f* 
\v 23  And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard
\add them\add*. 
\v 24  And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
him, and were sore afraid.\f + \fr 17.24  \ft from…: Heb. from his

\v 25  And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, \add that\add*
the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches,
and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free
in Israel. 
\v 26  And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be
done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the
reproach from Israel? for who \add is\add* this uncircumcised Philistine,
that he should defy the armies of the living God? 
\v 27  And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be
done to the man that killeth him. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the
men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou
down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart;
for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 
\v 29  And David said, What have I now done? \add Is there\add* not a
cause? 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.\f + \fr 17.30

\v 31  And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed

\p
\v 32 ¶ And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy
servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 
\v 33  And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou \add art but\add* a youth,
and he a man of war from his youth. 
\v 34  And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep,
and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:\f + \fr 17.34 
\ft lamb: or, kid\f* 
\v 35  And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered \add it\add*
out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught \add him\add*
by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 
\v 36  Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies
of the living God. 
\v 37  David said moreover, The \nd LORD\nd* that delivered me out of the
paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David,
Go, and the \nd LORD\nd* be with thee. 
\p
\v 38 ¶ And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet
of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.\f + \fr 17.38 
\ft armed David…: Heb. clothed David with his clothes\f* 
\v 39  And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed
to go; for he had not proved \add it\add*. And David said unto Saul,
I cannot go with these; for I have not proved \add them\add*. And
David put them off him. 
\p
\v 40  And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a

to the Philistine.\f + \fr 17.40  \ft brook: or, valley\f*\f + \fr 17.40 
\ft bag: Heb. vessel\f* 
\v 41  And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
man that bare the shield \add went\add* before him. 
\v 42  And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was
\add but\add* a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 
\v 43  And the Philistine said unto David, \add Am\add* I a dog,
that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David
by his gods. 
\v 44  And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
\v 45  Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the
name of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
whom thou hast defied. 
\v 46  This day will the \nd LORD\nd* deliver thee into mine hand;
and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will
give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the

earth may know that there is a God in Israel.\f + \fr 17.46  \ft deliver…: Heb. shut thee

\v 47  And all this assembly shall know that the \nd LORD\nd* saveth
not with sword and spear: for the battle \add is\add* the \nd LORD’s\nd*,
and he will give you into our hands. 
\p
\v 48  And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew
nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to
meet the Philistine. 
\v 49  And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
and slang \add it\add*, and smote the Philistine in his forehead,
that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face
to the earth. 
\v 50  So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but \add there was\add*
no sword in the hand of David. 
\v 51  Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut
off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion
was dead, they fled. 
\v 52  And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the
gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the
way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
\v 53  And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 
\v 54  And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 
\p
\v 55 ¶ And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine,
he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son \add is\add*
this youth? And Abner said, \add As\add* thy soul liveth, O king,
I cannot tell. 
\v 56  And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling \add is\add*.
\v 57  And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the
Philistine in his hand. 
\v 58  And Saul said to him, Whose son \add art\add* thou, \add thou\add*
young man? And David answered, I \add am\add* the son of thy servant
Jesse the Beth-lehemite. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
\v 2  And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
to his father’s house. 
\v 3  Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own
soul. 
\v 4  And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that \add was\add*
upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword,
and to his bow, and to his girdle. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, \add and\add*
behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was
accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of
Saul’s servants.\f + \fr 18.5  \ft behaved…: or, prospered\f* 
\p
\v 6  And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the

\v 7  And the women answered \add one another\add* as they played,

\v 8  And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have
ascribed \add but\add* thousands: and \add what\add* can he have more but the
kingdom?\f + \fr 18.8  \ft displeased him: Heb. was evil in his eyes\f*
\v 9  And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house:
and David played with his hand, as at other times: and \add there
was\add* a javelin in Saul’s hand. 
\v 11  And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
even to the wall \add with it\add*. And David avoided out of his
presence twice. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Saul was afraid of David, because the \nd LORD\nd* was with him, and was
departed from Saul. 
\v 13  Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
\v 14  And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the

\v 15  Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
he was afraid of him. 
\v 16  But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out
and came in before them. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I
give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the \nd LORD’s\nd*

\v 18  And David said unto Saul, Who \add am\add* I? and what \add is\add*

law to the king? 
\v 19  But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter
should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the
Meholathite to wife. 
\v 20  And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
and the thing pleased him.\f + \fr 18.20  \ft pleased him: Heb. was right in his

\v 21  And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare

Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in \add the one
of\add* the twain. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And Saul commanded his servants, \add saying\add*, Commune
with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his
servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son in law. 
\v 23  And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David.
And David said, Seemeth it to you \add a\add* light \add thing\add*

\v 25  And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be
avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall
by the hand of the Philistines. 
\v 26  And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David

\v 27  Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the

gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And Saul saw and knew that the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add*
with David, and \add that\add* Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.
\v 29  And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
David’s enemy continually. 
\v 30  Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass,
after they went forth, \add that\add* David behaved himself more

\v 2  But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take

\p
\v 4 ¶ And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against
David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works
\add have been\add* to thee-ward very good: 
\v 5  For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
and the \nd LORD\nd* wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
sawest \add it\add*, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou
sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? 
\v 6  And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
\add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, he shall not be slain. 
\v 7  And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence,
as in times past.\f + \fr 19.7  \ft in times…: Heb. yesterday, third
day\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled
from him.\f + \fr 19.8  \ft him: Heb. his face\f* 
\v 9  And the evil spirit from the \nd LORD\nd* was upon Saul, as he
sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
\add his\add* hand. 
\v 10  And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin;
but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin
into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night. 
\p
\v 11  Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to
slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying,
If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
\p
\v 12 ¶ So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
fled, and escaped. 
\v 13  And Michal took an image, and laid \add it\add* in the bed,
and put a pillow of goats’ \add hair\add* for his bolster, and covered
\add it\add* with a cloth.\f + \fr 19.13  \ft image: Heb. teraphim\f*
\v 14  And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He
\add is\add* sick. 
\v 15  And Saul sent the messengers \add again\add* to see David,
saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. 
\v 16  And when the messengers were come in, behold, \add there was\add*
an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats’ \add hair\add* for his
bolster. 
\v 17  And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent
away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered  Saul, He
said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee? 
\p
\v 18 ¶ So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
and dwelt in Naioth. 
\v 19  And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David \add is\add* at
Naioth in Ramah. 
\v 20  And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw
the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing \add as\add*
appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of
Saul, and they also prophesied. 
\v 21  And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they
prophesied also. 
\v 22  Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that
\add is\add* in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where \add are\add*
Samuel and David? And \add one\add* said, Behold, \add they be\add*
at Naioth in Ramah. 
\v 23  And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of
God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came
to Naioth in Ramah. 
\v 24  And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that
night. Wherefore they say, \add Is\add* Saul also among the prophets?\f + \fr 19.24 
\ft lay: Heb. fell\f* 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
Jonathan, What have I done? what \add is\add* mine iniquity? and what
\add is\add* my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? 
\v 2  And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my
father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew
it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it \add is\add* not
\add so\add*.\f + \fr 20.2  \ft shew…: Heb. uncover mine ear\f* 
\v 3  And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan
know this, lest he be grieved: but truly \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
liveth, and \add as\add* thy soul liveth, \add there is\add* but a
step between me and death. 
\v 4  Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth,
I will even do \add it\add* for thee.\f + \fr 20.4  \ft Whatsoever…: or, Say what is thy mind and I will do,
etc\f*\f + \fr 20.4  \ft desireth: Heb. speaketh, or, thinketh\f*
\v 5  And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow \add is\add*
the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat:
but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
\add day\add* at even. 
\v 6  If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
\add leave\add* of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for
\add there is\add* a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.\f + \fr 20.6 
\ft sacrifice: or, feast\f* 
\v 7  If he say thus, \add It is\add* well; thy servant shall have
peace: but if he be very wroth, \add then\add* be sure that evil
is determined by him. 
\v 8  Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
brought thy servant into a covenant of the \nd LORD\nd* with thee: notwithstanding, if there
be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring
me to thy father? 
\p
\v 9  And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly
that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I
tell it thee? 
\v 10  Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what \add if\add*
thy father answer thee roughly? 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
field. And they went out both of them into the field. 
\v 12  And Jonathan said unto David, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, \add or\add*
the third \add day\add*, and, behold, \add if there be\add* good
toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;\f + \fr 20.12 
\ft sounded: Heb. searched\f*\f + \fr 20.12  \ft shew…: Heb. uncover thine
ear\f* 
\v 13  The \nd LORD\nd* do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it
please my father \add to do\add* thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee
away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the \nd LORD\nd* be with thee, as he hath been with my
father.\f + \fr 20.13  \ft shew…: Heb. uncover thine ear\f* 
\v 14  And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
of the \nd LORD\nd*, that I die not: 
\v 15 But \add also\add* thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my
house for ever: no, not when the \nd LORD\nd* hath cut off the enemies
of David every one from the face of the earth. 
\v 16  So Jonathan made \add a covenant\add* with the house of David,
\add saying\add*, Let the \nd LORD\nd* even require \add it\add*
at the hand of David’s enemies.\f + \fr 20.16  \ft made: Heb. cut\f*
\v 17  And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.\f + \fr 20.17  \ft because…: or, by his love toward
him\f* 
\v 18  Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow \add is\add* the new
moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.\f + \fr 20.18 
\ft empty: Heb. missed\f* 
\v 19 And \add when\add* thou hast stayed three days, \add then\add*
thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst
hide thyself when the business was \add in hand\add*, and shalt remain
by the stone Ezel.\f + \fr 20.19  \ft quickly: or, diligently: Heb.
greatly\f*\f + \fr 20.19  \ft when the…: Heb. in the day of the business\f*\f + \fr 20.19 
\ft Ezel: or, that sheweth the way\f* 
\v 20  And I will shoot three arrows on the side \add thereof\add*,
as though I shot at a mark. 
\v 21  And, behold, I will send a lad, \add saying\add*, Go, find
out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
\add are\add* on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for
\add there is\add* peace to thee, and no hurt; \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
liveth.\f + \fr 20.21  \ft no hurt: Heb. not any thing\f* 
\v 22  But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows \add are\add*
beyond thee; go thy way: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent thee away.
\v 23 And \add as touching\add* the matter which thou and I have
spoken of, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* \add be\add* between thee and me
for ever. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon
was come, the king sat him down to eat meat. 
\v 25  And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, \add even\add*
upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s
side, and David’s place was empty. 
\v 26  Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
Something hath befallen him, he \add is\add* not clean; surely he
\add is\add* not clean. 
\v 27  And it came to pass on the morrow, \add which was\add* the
second \add day\add* of the month, that David’s place was empty:
and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son
of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day? 
\v 28  And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked \add leave\add*
of me \add to go\add* to Beth-lehem: 
\v 29  And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me \add to be
there:\add* and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get
away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the
king’s table. 
\v 30  Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious \add woman\add*, do not I
know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion,
and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?\f + \fr 20.30 
\ft Thou…: or, Thou perverse rebel: Heb. Son of perverse rebellion\f*
\v 31  For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be
established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely
die.\f + \fr 20.31  \ft shall…: Heb. is the son of death\f* 
\v 32  And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be
slain? what hath he done? 
\v 33  And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. 
\v 34  So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did
eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David,
because his father had done him shame. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
\v 36  And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
shoot. \add And\add* as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.\f + \fr 20.36 
\ft beyond…: Heb. to pass over him\f* 
\v 37  And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, \add Is\add*
not the arrow beyond thee? 
\v 38  And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay
not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\v 39  But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
the matter. 
\v 40  And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,
Go, carry \add them\add* to the city.\f + \fr 20.40  \ft artillery: Heb.
instruments\f*\f + \fr 20.40  \ft his lad: Heb. the lad that was
his\f* 
\p
\v 41 ¶ \add And\add* as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of
\add a place\add* toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground,
and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept
one with another, until David exceeded. 
\v 42  And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
sworn both of us in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, The \nd LORD\nd*
be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.
And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.\f + \fr 20.42 
\ft forasmuch…: or, the \+nd LORD\+nd* be witness of that which etc\f*
\c 21  
\p
\v 1  Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why \add art\add*
thou alone, and no man with thee?\f + \fr 21.1  \ft Ahimelech: also called
Ahiah\f* 
\v 2  And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded
me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the
business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have
appointed \add my\add* servants to such and such a place. 
\v 3  Now therefore what is under thine hand? give \add me\add* five
\add loaves of\add* bread in mine hand, or what there is present.\f + \fr 21.3 
\ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 4  And the priest answered David, and said, \add There is\add*
no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young
men have kept themselves at least from women. 
\v 5  And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
women \add have been\add* kept from us about these three days, since I came
out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and \add the bread
is\add* in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day
in the vessel.\f + \fr 21.5  \ft yea…: or, especially when this day there is other sanctified in the
vessel\f* 
\v 6  So the priest gave him hallowed \add bread:\add* for there was no
bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the \nd LORD\nd*,
to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. 
\v 7  Now a certain man of the servants of Saul \add was\add* there that
day, detained before the \nd LORD\nd*; and his name \add was\add*
Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that \add belonged\add*
to Saul. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine
hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons
with me, because the king’s business required haste. 
\v 9  And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou
slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it \add is here\add* wrapped
in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take \add it:\add* for
\add there is\add* no other save that here. And David said, \add There
is\add* none like that; give it me. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and
went to Achish the king of Gath. 
\v 11  And the servants of Achish said unto him, \add Is\add* not this
David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten
thousands? 
\v 12  And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid
 of Achish the king of Gath. 
\v 13  And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his
spittle fall down upon his beard.\f + \fr 21.13  \ft scrabbled: or, made
marks\f* 
\v 14  Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is
mad: wherefore \add then\add* have ye brought him to me?\f + \fr 21.14 
\ft is mad: or, playeth the mad man\f* 
\v 15  Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this \add fellow\add*
to play the mad man in my presence? shall this \add fellow\add* come
into my house? 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1  David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam:
and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard \add it\add*,
they went down thither to him. 
\v 2  And every one \add that was\add* in distress, and every one that
\add was\add* in debt, and every one \add that was\add* discontented,
gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about
four hundred men.\f + \fr 22.2  \ft was in debt: Heb. had a creditor\f*\f + \fr 22.2 
\ft discontented: Heb. bitter of soul\f* 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,
\add and be\add* with you, till I know what God will do for me. 
\v 4  And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
with him all the while that David was in the hold. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed,
and came into the forest of Hareth. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
\add were\add* with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants \add were\add*
standing about him;)\f + \fr 22.6  \ft tree…: or, grove in a high
place\f* 
\v 7  Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields
and vineyards, \add and\add* make you all captains of thousands,
and captains of hundreds; 
\v 8  That all of you have conspired against me, and \add there is\add*
none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son
of Jesse, and \add there is\add* none of you that is sorry for me, or
sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in
wait, as at this day?\f + \fr 22.8  \ft sheweth…: Heb. uncovereth mine

\p
\v 9 ¶ Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants
of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech
the son of Ahitub. 
\v 10  And he enquired of the \nd LORD\nd* for him, and gave him
victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. 
\v 11  Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that \add were\add*
in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. 
\v 12  And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I
\add am\add*, my lord.\f + \fr 22.12  \ft Here…: Heb. Behold me\f*
\v 13  And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the
son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast
enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in
wait, as at this day? 
\v 14  Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who \add is
so\add* faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s
son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine
house? 
\v 15  Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from
me: let not the king impute  \add any\add* thing unto his servant,
\add nor\add* to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew
nothing of all this, less or more.\f + \fr 22.15  \ft less…: Heb. little or
great\f* 
\v 16  And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy
father’s house. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him,
Turn, and slay the priests of the \nd LORD\nd*; because their hand also
\add is\add* with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their
hand to fall upon the priests of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 22.17 
\ft footmen: or, guard: Heb. runners\f* 
\v 18  And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.
And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew
on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
\v 19  And Nob, the city of the priests, smote  he with the edge
of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen,
and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 
\v 21  And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the \nd LORD’s\nd*
priests. 
\v 22  And David said unto Abiathar, I knew \add it\add* that day,
when Doeg the Edomite \add was\add* there, that he would surely tell
Saul: I have occasioned \add the death\add* of all the persons of thy
father’s house. 
\v 23  Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
seeketh thy life: but with me thou \add shalt be\add* in safeguard.
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 
\v 2  Therefore David enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I
go and smite these Philistines? And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto David,
Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. 
\v 3  And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies
of the Philistines? 
\v 4  Then David enquired of the \nd LORD\nd* yet again. And the
\nd LORD\nd* answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
\v 5  So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines,
and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter.
So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 
\v 6  And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
to David to Keilah, \add that\add* he came down \add with\add* an
ephod in his hand. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by
entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
\v 8  And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down
to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he
said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
\v 10  Then said David, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, thy servant
hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy
the city for my sake. 
\v 11  Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
come down, as thy servant hath heard? O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the \nd LORD\nd* said, He will come
down. 
\v 12  Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my
men into the hand of Saul? And the \nd LORD\nd* said, They will deliver
\add thee\add* up.\f + \fr 23.12  \ft deliver: Heb. shut up\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then David and his men, \add which were\add* about six hundred,
arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he
forbare to go forth. 
\p
\v 14  And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every
day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 
\v 15  And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
David \add was\add* in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the
wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 
\v 17  And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be
next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
\v 18  And they two made a covenant before the \nd LORD\nd*: and
David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill
of Hachilah, which \add is\add* on the south of Jeshimon?\f + \fr 23.19 
\ft on…: Heb. on the right hand\f*\f + \fr 23.19  \ft Jeshimon: or, the

\v 20  Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
of thy soul to come down; and our part \add shall be\add* to deliver
him into the king’s hand. 
\v 21  And Saul said, Blessed \add be\add* ye of the \nd LORD\nd*;
for ye have compassion on me. 
\v 22  Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his
haunt is, \add and\add* who hath seen him there: for it is told me
\add that\add* he dealeth very subtilly.\f + \fr 23.22  \ft haunt…: Heb. foot shall

where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty,
and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the
land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of
Judah. 
\v 24  And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his
men \add were\add* in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
south of Jeshimon. 
\v 25  Saul also and his men went to seek \add him\add*. And they
told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard \add that\add*, he pursued
after David in the wilderness of Maon.\f + \fr 23.25  \ft into…: or, from the
rock\f* 
\v 26  And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away
for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men
round about to take them. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.\f + \fr 23.27  \ft invaded…: Heb. spread themselves upon,
etc\f* 
\v 28  Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.\f + \fr 23.28 
\ft Sela-hammahlekoth: that is, The rock of divisions\f* 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds
at En-gedi. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following
the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David \add is\add*
in the wilderness of En-gedi.\f + \fr 24.1  \ft following: Heb. after\f*
\v 2  Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
\v 3  And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where \add was\add*
a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
remained in the sides of the cave. 
\v 4  And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the
\nd LORD\nd* said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine
hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.
Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.\f + \fr 24.4 
\ft Saul’s…: Heb. the robe which was Saul’s\f* 
\v 5  And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut
off Saul’s skirt. 
\v 6  And he said unto his men, The \nd LORD\nd* forbid that I should
do this thing unto my master, the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed, to stretch
forth mine hand against him, seeing he \add is\add* the anointed
of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 7  So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave,
and went on \add his\add* way.\f + \fr 24.7  \ft stayed: Heb. cut
off\f* 
\v 8  David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked  behind
him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words,
saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 
\v 10  Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the \nd LORD\nd*
had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and \add some\add*
bade \add me\add* kill thee: but \add mine eye\add* spared thee; and I
said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he \add is\add*
the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed. 
\v 11  Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not,
know thou and see that \add there is\add* neither evil nor transgression
in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest
my soul to take it. 
\v 12  The \nd LORD\nd* judge between me and thee, and the \nd LORD\nd*
avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 
\v 13  As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
 from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 
\v 14  After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 
\v 15  The \nd LORD\nd* therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.\f + \fr 24.15 
\ft deliver: Heb. judge\f* 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
these words unto Saul, that Saul said, \add Is\add* this thy voice,
my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 
\v 17  And he said to David, Thou \add art\add* more righteous than I: for thou hast
rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. 
\v 18  And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
with me: forasmuch as when the \nd LORD\nd* had delivered me into thine
hand, thou killedst me not.\f + \fr 24.18  \ft delivered: Heb. shut
up\f* 
\v 19  For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* reward thee good for that thou hast done
unto me this day. 
\v 20  And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
\v 21  Swear now therefore unto me by the \nd LORD\nd*, that thou wilt
not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name
out of my father’s house. 
\v 22  And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his
men gat them up unto the hold. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1  And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,
and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David
arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 
\p
\v 2 And \add there was\add* a man in Maon, whose possessions \add were\add*
in Carmel; and the man \add was\add* very great, and he had three
thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep
in Carmel.\f + \fr 25.2  \ft possessions: or, business\f* 
\v 3  Now the name of the man \add was\add* Nabal; and the name of his
wife Abigail: and \add she was\add* a woman of good understanding,
and of a beautiful countenance: but the man \add was\add* churlish
and evil in his doings; and he \add was\add* of the house of Caleb.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
sheep. 
\v 5  And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young
men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:\f + \fr 25.5 
\ft greet…: Heb. ask him in my name of peace\f* 
\v 6  And thus shall ye say to him that liveth \add in prosperity\add*,
Peace \add be\add* both to thee, and peace \add be\add* to thine
house, and peace \add be\add* unto all that thou hast. 
\v 7  And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds
which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing
unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.\f + \fr 25.7  \ft hurt: Heb.
shamed\f* 
\v 8  Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young
men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever
cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David. 
\v 9  And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those
words in the name of David, and ceased.\f + \fr 25.9  \ft ceased: Heb.
rested\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who \add is\add*
David? and who \add is\add* the son of Jesse? there be many servants
now a days that break away every man from his master. 
\v 11  Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have
killed for my shearers, and give \add it\add* unto men, whom I know not whence they
\add be\add*?\f + \fr 25.11  \ft flesh: Heb. slaughter\f* 
\p
\v 12  So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and
came and told him all those sayings. 
\v 13  And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on
his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men;
and two hundred abode by the stuff. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,
Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
master; and he railed on them.\f + \fr 25.14  \ft railed…: Heb. flew upon
them\f* 
\v 15  But the men \add were\add* very good unto us, and we were not
hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
with them, when we were in the fields:\f + \fr 25.15  \ft hurt: Heb.
shamed\f* 
\v 16  They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
we were with them keeping the sheep. 
\v 17  Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil
is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he
\add is such\add* a son of Belial, that \add a man\add* cannot speak to him.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and
two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures
of parched \add corn\add*, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two
hundred cakes of figs, and laid \add them\add* on asses.\f + \fr 25.18 
\ft clusters: or, lumps\f* 
\v 19  And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. 
\v 20 And it was \add so, as\add* she rode on the ass, that she came
down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
down against her; and she met them. 
\v 21  Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
\add fellow\add* hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that
\add pertained\add* unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
\v 22  So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that
\add pertain\add* to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the
wall. 
\v 23  And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the
ground, 
\v 24  And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, \add upon\add* me
\add let this\add* iniquity \add be:\add* and let thine handmaid,
I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine
handmaid.\f + \fr 25.24  \ft audience: Heb. ears\f* 
\v 25  Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, \add even\add*
Nabal: for as his name \add is\add*, so \add is\add* he; Nabal \add is\add*
his name, and folly \add is\add* with him: but I thine handmaid saw

\ft regard: Heb. lay it to his heart\f*\f + \fr 25.25  \ft Nabal: that is,

\v 26  Now therefore, my lord, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, and
\add as\add* thy soul liveth, seeing the \nd LORD\nd* hath withholden
thee from coming to \add shed\add* blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own
hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord,
be as Nabal.\f + \fr 25.26  \ft avenging…: Heb. saving thyself\f*
\v 27  And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my

\ft blessing: or, present\f*\f + \fr 25.27  \ft follow…: Heb. walk at the feet of,

\v 28  I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
\nd LORD\nd* will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my
lord fighteth the battles of the \nd LORD\nd*, and evil hath not been
found in thee \add all\add* thy days. 
\v 29  Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out,
\add as out\add* of the middle of a sling.\f + \fr 25.29  \ft as out…: Heb. in the midst of the bought of a

\v 30  And it shall come to pass, when the \nd LORD\nd* shall have
done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have
appointed thee ruler over Israel; 
\v 31  That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my
lord hath avenged himself: but when the \nd LORD\nd* shall have dealt
well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.\f + \fr 25.31  \ft no grief: Heb. no staggering, or,

\p
\v 32 ¶ And David said to Abigail, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: 
\v 33  And blessed \add be\add* thy advice, and blessed \add be\add*
thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to \add shed\add* blood,
and from avenging myself with mine own hand. 
\v 34  For in very deed, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel
liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst
hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal
by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. 
\v 35  So David received of her hand \add that\add* which she had
brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see,
I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart \add was\add*
merry within him, for he \add was\add* very drunken: wherefore she
told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. 
\v 37  But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone
out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart
died within him, and he became \add as\add* a stone. 
\v 38  And it came to pass about ten days \add after\add*, that the
\nd LORD\nd* smote Nabal, that he died. 
\p
\v 39 ¶ And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed
\add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, that hath pleaded the cause of my
reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil:
for the \nd LORD\nd* hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own
head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to
wife. 
\v 40  And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to
wife. 
\v 41  And she arose, and bowed herself on \add her\add* face to the
earth, and said, Behold, \add let\add* thine handmaid \add be\add*
a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. 
\v 42  And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with
five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
messengers of David, and became his wife.\f + \fr 25.42  \ft after her: Heb. at her

\v 43  David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both
of them his wives. 
\p
\v 44 ¶ But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to
Phalti the son of Laish, which \add was\add* of Gallim.\f + \fr 25.44 
\ft Phalti: also called, Phaltiel\f* 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1  And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, \add which is\add* before
Jeshimon? 
\v 2  Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having
three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the
wilderness of Ziph. 
\v 3  And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which \add is\add*
before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he
saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. 
\v 4  David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
come in very deed. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,
the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people
pitched round about him.\f + \fr 26.5  \ft trench: or, midst of his
carriages\f* 
\p
\v 6  Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go
down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
\v 7  So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him. 
\v 8  Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the
spear even to the earth at once, and I will not \add smite\add* him the second
time.\f + \fr 26.8  \ft delivered: Heb. shut up\f* 
\v 9  And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch
forth his hand against the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed, and be guiltless?
\v 10  David said furthermore, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth,
the \nd LORD\nd* shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall
descend into battle, and perish. 
\v 11  The \nd LORD\nd* forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand
against the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the
spear that \add is\add* at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us
go. 
\v 12  So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s
bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw \add it\add*, nor
knew \add it\add*, neither awaked: for they \add were\add* all asleep;
because a deep sleep from the \nd LORD\nd* was fallen upon them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the
top of an hill afar off; a great space \add being\add* between them:
\v 14  And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who
\add art\add* thou \add that\add* criest to the king? 
\v 15  And David said to Abner, \add Art\add* not thou a \add valiant\add*
man? and who \add is\add* like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not
kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy
the king thy lord. 
\v 16  This thing \add is\add* not good that thou hast done. \add As\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, ye \add are\add* worthy to die, because ye have not
kept your master, the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed. And now see where the
king’s spear \add is\add*, and the cruse of water that \add was\add*
at his bolster.\f + \fr 26.16  \ft worthy to die: Heb. the sons of

\v 17  And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, \add Is\add* this thy
voice, my son David? And David said, \add It is\add* my voice, my
lord, O king. 
\v 18  And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
servant? for what have I done? or what evil \add is\add* in mine
hand? 
\v 19  Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
words of his servant. If the \nd LORD\nd* have stirred thee up against me, let him
accept an offering: but if \add they be\add* the children of men,
cursed \add be\add* they before the \nd LORD\nd*; for they have driven
me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the \nd LORD\nd*,
saying, Go, serve other gods.\f + \fr 26.19  \ft accept: Heb. smell\f*\f + \fr 26.19 
\ft abiding: Heb. cleaving\f* 
\v 20  Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
face of the \nd LORD\nd*: for the king of Israel is come out to seek
a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee
harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the
fool, and have erred exceedingly. 
\v 22  And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let
one of the young men come over and fetch it. 
\v 23  The \nd LORD\nd* render to every man his righteousness and his
faithfulness: for the \nd LORD\nd* delivered thee into \add my\add*
hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the
\nd LORD’s\nd* anointed. 
\v 24  And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and let him deliver me out of all tribulation. 
\v 25  Then Saul said to David, Blessed \add be\add* thou, my son
David: thou shalt both do great \add things\add*, and also shalt
still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his
place. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1  And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
hand of Saul: \add there is\add* nothing better for me than that
I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul
shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel:
so shall I escape out of his hand.\f + \fr 27.1  \ft perish: Heb. be

\v 2  And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
\add were\add* with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\v 3  And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every
man with his household, \add even\add* David with his two wives,
Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
\v 4  And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought
no more again for him. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may
dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
\v 6  Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the
kings of Judah unto this day. 
\v 7  And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines
was a full year and four months.\f + \fr 27.7  \ft the time: Heb. the number of
days\f*\f + \fr 27.7  \ft a full year: Heb. a year of days\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites,
and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those \add nations were\add*
of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the
land of Egypt.\f + \fr 27.8  \ft Gezrites: or, Gerzites\f* 
\v 9  And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,
and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels,
and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish. 
\v 10  And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites,
and against the south of the Kenites.\f + \fr 27.10  \ft Whither…: or, Did you not make a road,
etc\f* 
\v 11  And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring \add tidings\add*
to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so
\add will be\add* his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country
of the Philistines. 
\v 12  And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for
ever.\f + \fr 27.12  \ft utterly…: Heb. to stink\f* 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered
their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish
said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to
battle, thou and thy men. 
\v 2  And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant
can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper
of mine head for ever. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away
those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\v 4  And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came
and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they
pitched in Gilboa. 
\v 5  And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
and his heart greatly trembled. 
\v 6  And when Saul enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, the \nd LORD\nd*
answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath
a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his
servants said to him, Behold, \add there is\add* a woman that hath
a familiar spirit at Endor. 
\v 8  And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night:
and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me
\add him\add* up, whom I shall name unto thee. 
\v 9  And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits,
and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare
for my life, to cause me to die? 
\v 10  And Saul sware to her by the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, \add As\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, there shall no punishment happen  to thee for this
thing. 
\v 11  Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
said, Bring me up Samuel. 
\v 12  And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou
\add art\add* Saul. 
\v 13  And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the
earth. 
\v 14  And he said unto her, What form \add is\add* he of? And she
said, An old man cometh up; and he \add is\add* covered with a mantle.
And Saul perceived that it \add was\add* Samuel, and he stooped with
\add his\add* face to the ground, and bowed himself.\f + \fr 28.14 
\ft What…: Heb. What is his form?\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me
up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither
by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make
known unto me what I shall do.\f + \fr 28.15  \ft by prophets: Heb. by the hand of
prophets\f* 
\v 16  Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
\nd LORD\nd* is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 
\v 17  And the \nd LORD\nd* hath done to him, as he spake by me:
for the \nd LORD\nd* hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and
given it to thy neighbour, \add even\add* to David:\f + \fr 28.17 
\ft to him: or, for himself\f*\f + \fr 28.17  \ft me: Heb. mine hand\f*
\v 18  Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, nor
executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the \nd LORD\nd*
done this thing unto thee this day. 
\v 19  Moreover the \nd LORD\nd* will also deliver Israel with thee into the
hand of the Philistines: and to morrow \add shalt\add* thou and thy
sons \add be\add* with me: the \nd LORD\nd* also shall deliver the
host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. 
\p
\v 20  Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength
in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.\f + \fr 28.20 
\ft fell…: Heb. made haste, and fell with the fulness of his stature\f*
\p
\v 21 ¶ And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice,
and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words
which thou spakest unto me. 
\v 22  Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and
eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
\v 23  But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their
voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
\v 24  And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted,
and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded \add it\add*, and did
bake unleavened bread thereof: 
\v 25  And she brought \add it\add* before Saul, and before his servants;
and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1  Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which \add is\add* in Jezreel.
\v 2  And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.
\v 3  Then said the princes of the Philistines, What \add do\add*
these Hebrews \add here\add*? And Achish said unto the princes of the
Philistines, \add Is\add* not this David, the servant of Saul the
king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
and I have found no fault in him since he fell \add unto me\add*
unto this day? 
\v 4  And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the
princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return,
that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go
down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he
reconcile himself unto his master? \add should it\add* not \add be\add*
with the heads of these men? 
\v 5  \add Is\add* not this David, of whom they sang one to another in
dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, \add as\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out
and thy coming in with me in the host \add is\add* good in my sight:
for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this
day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.\f + \fr 29.6  \ft the lords…: Heb. thou art not good in the eyes of the
lords\f* 
\v 7  Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease
not the lords of the Philistines.\f + \fr 29.7  \ft displease…: Heb. do not evil in the eyes of the
lords\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou
found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day,
that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\f + \fr 29.8 
\ft with…: Heb. before thee\f* 
\v 9  And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou \add art\add*
good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes
of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
\v 10  Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s
servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the
morning, and have light, depart. 
\v 11  So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went
up to Jezreel. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag
on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and
Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 
\v 2  And had taken the women captives, that \add were\add* therein: they
slew not any, either great or small, but carried \add them\add* away,
and went on their way. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, \add it
was\add* burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
daughters, were taken captives. 
\v 4  Then David and the people that \add were\add* with him lifted
up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. 
\v 5  And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
\v 6  And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his
sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the \nd LORD\nd*
his God.\f + \fr 30.6  \ft grieved: Heb. bitter\f* 
\p
\v 7  And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me
hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
\v 8  And David enquired at the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I pursue
after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue:
for thou shalt surely overtake \add them\add*, and without fail recover
\add all\add*. 
\v 9  So David went, he and the six hundred men that \add were\add*
with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left
behind stayed. 
\v 10  But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the
brook Besor. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink
water; 
\v 12  And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of
raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had
eaten no bread, nor drunk \add any\add* water, three days and three
nights. 
\v 13  And David said unto him, To whom \add belongest\add* thou? and whence
\add art\add* thou? And he said, I \add am\add* a young man of Egypt,
servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days
agone I fell sick. 
\v 14  We made an invasion \add upon\add* the south of the Cherethites, and upon
\add the coast\add* which \add belongeth\add* to Judah, and upon the
south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. 
\v 15  And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me,
nor deliver  me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee
down to this company. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And when he had brought him down, behold, \add they were\add*
spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land
of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
\v 17  And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred
young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.\f + \fr 30.17  \ft the next…: Heb. their
morrow\f* 
\v 18  And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
and David rescued his two wives. 
\v 19  And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any \add thing\add*
that they had taken to them: David recovered  all. 
\v 20  And David took all the flocks and the herds, \add which\add*
they drave before those \add other\add* cattle, and said, This \add is\add*
David’s spoil. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide
at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet
the people that \add were\add* with him: and when David came near
to the people, he saluted them.\f + \fr 30.21  \ft saluted…: or, asked them how they
did\f* 
\v 22  Then answered all the wicked men and \add men\add* of Belial,
of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not
give them \add ought\add* of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every
man his wife and his children, that they may lead \add them\add*
away, and depart.\f + \fr 30.22  \ft those: Heb. men\f* 
\v 23  Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the
\nd LORD\nd* hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered
the company that came against us into our hand. 
\v 24  For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
\add is\add* that goeth down to the battle, so \add shall\add* his
part \add be\add* that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
\v 25 And it was \add so\add* from that day forward, that he made
it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.\f + \fr 30.25 
\ft forward: Heb. and forward\f* 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
elders of Judah, \add even\add* to his friends, saying, Behold a
present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the \nd LORD\nd*;\f + \fr 30.26 
\ft present: Heb. blessing\f* 
\v 27 To \add  them\add* which \add were\add* in Beth-el, and to
\add them\add* which \add were\add* in south Ramoth, and to \add them\add* which
\add were\add* in Jattir, 
\v 28 And to \add them\add* which \add were\add* in Aroer, and to
\add them\add* which \add were\add* in Siphmoth, and to \add them\add* which
\add were\add* in Eshtemoa, 
\v 29 And to \add them\add* which \add were\add* in Rachal, and to
\add them\add* which \add were\add* in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to
\add them\add* which \add were\add* in the cities of the Kenites,
\v 30 And to \add them\add* which \add were\add* in Hormah, and to
\add them\add* which \add were\add* in Chor-ashan, and to \add them\add* which
\add were\add* in Athach, 
\v 31 And to \add them\add* which \add were\add* in Hebron, and to all the
places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1  Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel
fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.\f + \fr 31.1 
\ft slain: or, wounded\f* 
\v 2  And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua,
Saul’s sons. 
\v 3  And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.\f + \fr 31.3  \ft and the archers: Heb. and the shooters, men with
bows\f*\f + \fr 31.3  \ft hit…: Heb. found him\f* 
\v 4  Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me
through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through,
and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.
Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.\f + \fr 31.4  \ft abuse…: or, mock
me\f* 
\v 5  And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his
sword, and died with him. 
\v 6  So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his
men, that same day together. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And when the men of Israel that \add were\add* on the other
side of the valley, and \add they\add* that \add were\add* on the other
side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his
sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines
came and dwelt in them. 
\p
\v 8  And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen
in mount Gilboa. 
\v 9  And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish \add it
in\add* the house of their idols, and among the people. 
\v 10  And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the
Philistines had done to Saul;\f + \fr 31.11  \ft of that: or, concerning him
that\f* 
\v 12  All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan,
and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
\v 13  And they took their bones, and buried \add them\add* under a
tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
