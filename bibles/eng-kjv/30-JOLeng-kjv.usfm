\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
\v 2  Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?
\v 3  Tell ye your children of it, and \add let\add* your children
\add tell\add* their children, and their children another generation.
\v 4  That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten;
and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the
cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft That which the palmerworm…: Heb. The residue of the
palmerworm\f* 
\v 5  Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of
wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
\v 6  For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,
whose teeth \add are\add* the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek
teeth of a great lion. 
\v 7  He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it
clean bare, and cast \add it\add* away; the branches thereof are made
white.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft barked…: Heb. laid my fig tree for a barking\f*
\p
\v 8 ¶ Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband
of her youth. 
\v 9  The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*; the priests, the \nd LORD’s\nd* ministers,
mourn. 
\v 10  The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted:
the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 
\v 11  Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the
wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.
\v 12  The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate
tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, \add even\add* all the
trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the
sons of men. 
\v 13  Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers
of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my
God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the
house of your God. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders
\add and\add* all the inhabitants of the land \add into\add* the
house of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and cry unto the \nd LORD\nd*,\f + \fr 1.14 
\ft solemn…: or, day of restraint\f* 
\v 15  Alas for the day! for the day of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add*
at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. 
\v 16  Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, \add yea\add*, joy
and gladness from the house of our God? 
\v 17  The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft seed: Heb. grains\f* 
\v 18  How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,
because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
\v 19  O \nd LORD\nd*, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured
the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the
trees of the field.\f + \fr 1.19  \ft pastures: or, habitations\f*
\v 20  The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers
of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the
wilderness. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day
of the \nd LORD\nd* cometh, for \add it is\add* nigh at hand;\f + \fr 2.1 
\ft trumpet: or, cornet\f* 
\v 2  A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people
and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any
more after it, \add even\add* to the years of many generations.\f + \fr 2.2 
\ft of many…: Heb. of generation and generation\f* 
\v 3  A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth:
the land \add is\add* as the garden of Eden before them, and behind
them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. 
\v 4  The appearance of them \add is\add* as the appearance of horses;
and as horsemen, so shall they run. 
\v 5  Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble,
as a strong people set in battle array. 
\v 6  Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
shall gather blackness.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft blackness: Heb. pot\f* 
\v 7  They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like
men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not
break their ranks: 
\v 8  Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one
in his path: and \add when\add* they fall upon the sword, they shall not be
wounded.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft sword: or, dart\f* 
\v 9  They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the
windows like a thief. 
\v 10  The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble:
the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw
their shining: 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall utter his voice before his army:
for his camp \add is\add* very great: for \add he is\add* strong
that executeth his word: for the day of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add*
great and very terrible; and who can abide it? 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Therefore also now, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, turn ye \add even\add*
to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
mourning: 
\v 13  And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
\nd LORD\nd* your God: for he \add is\add* gracious and merciful,
slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
\v 14  Who knoweth \add if\add* he will return and repent, and leave
a blessing behind him; \add even\add* a meat offering and a drink
offering unto the \nd LORD\nd* your God? 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
assembly: 
\v 16  Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the
bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
\v 17  Let the priests, the ministers of the \nd LORD\nd*, weep between the
porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O \nd LORD\nd*,
and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule
over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where \add is\add*
their God?\f + \fr 2.17  \ft rule over: or, use a byword against\f*
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then will the \nd LORD\nd* be jealous for his land, and pity
his people. 
\v 19  Yea, the \nd LORD\nd* will answer and say unto his people,
Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the
heathen: 
\v 20  But I will remove far off from you the northern \add army\add*,
and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his
stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath
done great things.\f + \fr 2.20  \ft hath…: Heb. hath magnified to
do\f* 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the \nd LORD\nd*
will do great things.\f + \fr 2.21  \ft will…: Heb. hath magnified to
do\f* 
\v 22  Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth  her fruit, the fig tree
and the vine do yield their strength. 
\v 23  Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the \nd LORD\nd*
your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come
down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the
first \add month\add*.\f + \fr 2.23  \ft the former rain moderately: or, a teacher of
righteousness\f*\f + \fr 2.23  \ft moderately: Heb. according to
righteousness\f* 
\v 24  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall
overflow with wine and oil. 
\v 25  And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,
the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great
army which I sent among you. 
\v 26  And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
name of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my
people shall never be ashamed. 
\v 27  And ye shall know that I \add am\add* in the midst of Israel, and
\add that\add* I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and none else: and my
people shall never be ashamed. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And it shall come to pass afterward, \add that\add* I will pour
out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see
visions: 
\v 29  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those
days will I pour out my spirit. 
\v 30  And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,
and fire, and pillars of smoke. 
\v 31  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
before the great and the terrible day of the \nd LORD\nd* come. 
\v 32 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whosoever shall call
on the name of the \nd LORD\nd* shall be delivered: for in mount
Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the \nd LORD\nd* hath
said, and in the remnant whom the \nd LORD\nd* shall call. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring
again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
\v 2  I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the
valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and
\add for\add* my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the
nations, and parted my land. 
\v 3  And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy
for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. 
\v 4  Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the
coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense
me, swiftly \add and\add* speedily will I return your recompence
upon your own head; 
\v 5  Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
into your temples my goodly pleasant things:\f + \fr 3.5  \ft pleasant: Heb.
desirable\f* 
\v 6  The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye
sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their
border.\f + \fr 3.6  \ft the Grecians: Heb. the sons of the Grecians\f*
\v 7  Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have
sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: 
\v 8  And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand
of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans,
to a people far off: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken \add it\add*.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare  war, wake up
the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:\f + \fr 3.9 
\ft Prepare: Heb. Sanctify\f* 
\v 10  Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into
spears: let the weak say, I \add am\add* strong.\f + \fr 3.10  \ft pruninghooks: or,
scythes\f* 
\v 11  Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves
together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down,
O \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 3.11  \ft cause…: or, the \+nd LORD\+nd* shall bring
down\f* 
\v 12  Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat:
for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about. 
\v 13  Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness
\add is\add* great. 
\v 14  Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the
day of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* near in the valley of decision.\f + \fr 3.14 
\ft decision: or, concision, or, threshing\f* 
\v 15  The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
withdraw their shining. 
\v 16  The \nd LORD\nd* also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his
voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake:
but the \nd LORD\nd* \add will be\add* the hope of his people, and the
strength of the children of Israel.\f + \fr 3.16  \ft hope: Heb. place of repair, or,
harbour\f* 
\v 17  So shall ye know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your
God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy,
and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.\f + \fr 3.17 
\ft holy: Heb. holiness\f* 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the
mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with
milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain
shall come forth of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and shall water
the valley of Shittim.\f + \fr 3.18  \ft flow: Heb. go\f* 
\v 19  Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
wilderness, for the violence \add against\add* the children of Judah,
because they have shed innocent blood in their land. 
\v 20  But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation
to generation.\f + \fr 3.20  \ft dwell: or, abide\f* 
\v 21  For I will cleanse their blood \add that\add* I have not cleansed:
for the \nd LORD\nd* dwelleth in Zion.\f + \fr 3.21  \ft for the…: or, even I the
\+nd LORD\+nd* that\f*
