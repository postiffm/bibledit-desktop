\p
\v 1  In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
\v 2  And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the
land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels
into the treasure house of his god. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
that he should bring \add certain\add* of the children of Israel,
and of the king’s seed, and of the princes; 
\v 4  Children in whom \add was\add* no blemish, but well favoured,
and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding
science, and such as \add had\add* ability in them to stand in the
king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue
of the Chaldeans. 
\v 5  And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s
meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years,
that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.\f + \fr 1.5 
\ft the wine…: Heb. the wine of his drink\f* 
\v 6  Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah: 
\v 7  Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
unto Daniel \add the name\add* of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah,
of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
\p
\v 8 ¶ But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he
drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
defile himself. 
\v 9  Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
the prince of the eunuchs. 
\v 10  And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my
lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he
see your faces worse liking than the children which \add are\add*
of your sort? then shall ye make \add me\add* endanger my head to the
king.\f + \fr 1.10  \ft worse…: Heb. sadder\f*\f + \fr 1.10  \ft sort: or, term, or,
continuance?\f* 
\v 11  Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs
had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,\f + \fr 1.11 
\ft Melzar: or, the steward\f* 
\v 12  Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.\f + \fr 1.12  \ft pulse: Heb. of
pulse\f*\f + \fr 1.12  \ft to eat…: Heb. that we may eat, etc\f*
\v 13  Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s
meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 
\v 14  So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
days. 
\v 15  And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer
and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion
of the king’s meat. 
\v 16  Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
that they should drink; and gave them pulse. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions
and dreams.\f + \fr 1.17  \ft Daniel…: or, he made Daniel understand\f*
\v 18  Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
Nebuchadnezzar. 
\v 19  And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood
they before the king. 
\v 20  And in all matters of wisdom \add and\add* understanding,
that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
magicians \add and\add* astrologers that \add were\add* in all his
realm.\f + \fr 1.20  \ft wisdom…: Heb. wisdom of understanding\f*
\v 21  And Daniel continued \add even\add* unto the first year of
king Cyrus. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar
dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep
brake from him. 
\v 2  Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers,
and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams.
So they came and stood before the king. 
\v 3  And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
spirit was troubled to know the dream. 
\v 4  Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live
for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.\f + \fr 2.4 
\ft O king…: (Chaldee, to the end of chapter seven)\f* 
\v 5  The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made
a dunghill.\f + \fr 2.5  \ft cut…: Chaldee, made pieces\f* 
\v 6  But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew
me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft rewards: or,
fee\f* 
\v 7  They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. 
\v 8  The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would
gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.\f + \fr 2.8 
\ft gain: Chaldee, buy\f* 
\v 9  But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, \add there is
but\add* one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt
words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell
me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
\p
\v 10 ¶ The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is
not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore
\add there is\add* no king, lord, nor ruler, \add that\add* asked
such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. 
\v 11 And \add it is\add* a rare thing that the king requireth, and there
is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods,
whose dwelling is not with flesh. 
\v 12  For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded
to destroy all the wise \add men\add* of Babylon. 
\v 13  And the decree went forth that the wise \add men\add* should be
slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise
\add men\add* of Babylon:\f + \fr 2.14  \ft answered…: Chaldee, returned\f*\f + \fr 2.14 
\ft captain…: or, chief marshal: Chaldee, chief of the executioners, or,
slaughtermen\f* 
\v 15  He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why \add is\add*
the decree \add so\add* hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the
thing known to Daniel. 
\v 16  Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.
\v 17  Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
\v 18  That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the
rest of the wise \add men\add* of Babylon.\f + \fr 2.18  \ft of the God: Chaldee, from before
God\f*\f + \fr 2.18  \ft that Daniel…: or, that they should not destroy Daniel,
etc\f* 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
\v 20  Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
and ever: for wisdom and might are his: 
\v 21  And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge
to them that know understanding: 
\v 22  He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what \add is\add*
in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. 
\v 23  I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast
given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we
desired of thee: for thou hast \add now\add* made known unto us the
king’s matter. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained
to destroy the wise \add men\add* of Babylon: he went and said thus
unto him; Destroy not the wise \add men\add* of Babylon: bring me
in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.
\v 25  Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah,
that will make known unto the king the interpretation.\f + \fr 2.25 
\ft I have…: Chaldee, That I have found\f*\f + \fr 2.25  \ft captives…: Chaldee, children of the captivity of
Judah\f* 
\v 26  The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name \add was\add*
Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have
seen, and the interpretation thereof? 
\v 27  Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise \add men\add*,
the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;
\v 28  But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh
known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.
Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;\f + \fr 2.28 
\ft maketh…: Chaldee, hath made known\f* 
\v 29  As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came \add into thy mind\add*
upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth
secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.\f + \fr 2.29 
\ft came: Chaldee, came up\f* 
\v 30  But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for \add any\add*
wisdom that I have more than any living, but for \add their\add*
sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest
know the thoughts of thy heart.\f + \fr 2.30  \ft but for…: or, but for the intent that the interpretation may be made known to
the king\f* 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
image, whose brightness \add was\add* excellent, stood before thee; and the
form thereof \add was\add* terrible.\f + \fr 2.31  \ft sawest: Chaldee, wast
seeing\f* 
\v 32  This image’s head \add was\add* of fine gold, his breast and his
arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,\f + \fr 2.32 
\ft thighs: or, sides\f* 
\v 33  His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
\v 34  Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
smote the image upon his feet \add that were\add* of iron and clay,
and brake them to pieces.\f + \fr 2.34  \ft without…: or, which was not in
hands\f* 
\v 35  Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the
summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place
was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great
mountain, and filled the whole earth. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ This \add is\add* the dream; and we will tell the interpretation
thereof before the king. 
\v 37  Thou, O king, \add art\add* a king of kings: for the God of
heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
\v 38  And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand,
and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou \add art\add* this head
of gold. 
\v 39  And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all
the earth. 
\v 40  And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as
iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all \add things:\add* and as
iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
\v 41  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’
clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall
be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the
iron mixed with miry clay. 
\v 42 And \add as\add* the toes of the feet \add were\add* part of
iron, and part of clay, \add so\add* the kingdom shall be partly
strong, and partly broken.\f + \fr 2.42  \ft broken: or, brittle\f*
\v 43  And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle
themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to
another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.\f + \fr 2.43  \ft one…: Chaldee, this with
this\f* 
\v 44  And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall
not be left to other people, \add but\add* it shall break in pieces
and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.\f + \fr 2.44 
\ft the days: Chaldee, their days\f*\f + \fr 2.44  \ft the kingdom: Chaldee, the kingdom
thereof\f* 
\v 45  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the
brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made
known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream
\add is\add* certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\f + \fr 2.45 
\ft without…: or, which was not in hands\f*\f + \fr 2.45  \ft hereafter: Chaldee, after
this\f* 
\p
\v 46 ¶ Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped
Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet
odours unto him. 
\v 47  The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth \add it
is\add*, that your God \add is\add* a God of gods, and a Lord of
kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this
secret. 
\v 48  Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and
chief of the governors over all the wise \add men\add* of Babylon.
\v 49  Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel
\add sat\add* in the gate of the king. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
\add was\add* threescore cubits, \add and\add* the breadth thereof
six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of
Babylon. 
\v 2  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes,
the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the
counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to
come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king
had set up. 
\v 3  Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges,
the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the
image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before
the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
\v 4  Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
nations, and languages,\f + \fr 3.4  \ft aloud: Chaldee, with might\f*\f + \fr 3.4 
\ft it…: Chaldee, they command\f* 
\v 5  \add That\add* at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet,
flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick,
ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
king hath set up:\f + \fr 3.5  \ft dulcimer: or, singing: Chaldee,
symphony\f* 
\v 6  And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
\v 7  Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound
of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick,
all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down \add and\add*
worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set
up. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused
the Jews. 
\v 9  They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
for ever. 
\v 10  Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and
dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the
golden image:\f + \fr 3.10  \ft dulcimer: or, singing: Chaldee, symphony\f*
\v 11  And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, \add that\add*
he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
\v 12  There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs
of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these
men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor
worship the golden image which thou hast set up.\f + \fr 3.12  \ft have…: Chaldee, have set no regard upon
thee\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar in \add his\add* rage and fury commanded
to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these
men before the king. 
\v 14  Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, \add Is it\add* true,
O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor
worship the golden image which I have set up?\f + \fr 3.14  \ft true: or, of
purpose\f* 
\v 15  Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds
of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;
\add well:\add* but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same
hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who \add is\add*
that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?\f + \fr 3.15  \ft dulcimer: or, singing: Chaldee,
symphony\f* 
\v 16  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the
king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we \add are\add* not careful to answer thee
in this matter. 
\v 17  If it be \add so\add*, our God whom we serve is able to deliver
us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver \add us\add*
out of thine hand, O king. 
\v 18  But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not
serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set
up. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: \add therefore\add*
he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven
times more than it was wont to be heated.\f + \fr 3.19  \ft full: Chaldee,
filled\f* 
\v 20  And he commanded the most mighty men that \add were\add* in his
army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, \add and\add* to cast
\add them\add* into the burning fiery furnace.\f + \fr 3.20  \ft most…: Chaldee, mighty of
strength\f* 
\v 21  Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their
hats, and their \add other\add* garments, and were cast into the
midst of the burning fiery furnace.\f + \fr 3.21  \ft coats: or,
mantles\f*\f + \fr 3.21  \ft hats: or, turbans\f* 
\v 22  Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the
furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took
up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.\f + \fr 3.22  \ft commandment: Chaldee,
word\f*\f + \fr 3.22  \ft flame: or, spark\f* 
\v 23  And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell
down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
\v 24  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
haste, \add and\add* spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not
we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered
and said unto the king, True, O king.\f + \fr 3.24  \ft counsellors: or,
governors\f* 
\v 25  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth
is like the Son of God.\f + \fr 3.25  \ft they…: Chaldee, there is no hurt in
them\f* 
\p
\v 26 ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
fiery furnace, \add and\add* spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
come \add hither\add*. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came
forth of the midst of the fire.\f + \fr 3.26  \ft mouth: Chaldee,
door\f* 
\v 27  And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors,
being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire
had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their
coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. 
\p
\v 28  \add Then\add* Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed \add be\add*
the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel,
and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve
nor worship any god, except their own God. 
\v 29  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses
shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can
deliver after this sort.\f + \fr 3.29  \ft I make…: Chaldee, a decree is made by
me\f*\f + \fr 3.29  \ft any…: Chaldee, error\f*\f + \fr 3.29  \ft cut…: Chaldee, made
pieces\f* 
\v 30  Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the
province of Babylon.\f + \fr 3.30  \ft promoted: Chaldee, made to
prosper\f* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
\v 2  I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high
God hath wrought toward me.\f + \fr 4.2  \ft I thought…: Chaldee, It was seemly before
me\f* 
\v 3  How great \add are\add* his signs! and how mighty \add are\add*
his wonders! his kingdom \add is\add* an everlasting kingdom, and his
dominion \add is\add* from generation to generation. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing
in my palace: 
\v 5  I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
\v 6  Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise \add men\add*
of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation
of the dream. 
\v 7  Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did
not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name \add was\add*
Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom \add is\add*
the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, \add saying\add*,
\v 9  O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the
spirit of the holy gods \add is\add* in thee, and no secret troubleth
thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
\v 10 Thus \add were\add* the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw,
and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof
\add was\add* great.\f + \fr 4.10  \ft I saw: Chaldee, I was seeing\f*
\v 11  The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 
\v 12  The leaves thereof \add were\add* fair, and the fruit thereof
much, and in it \add was\add* meat for all: the beasts of the field
had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. 
\v 13  I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold,
a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; 
\v 14  He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut
off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the
beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:\f + \fr 4.14 
\ft aloud: Chaldee, with might\f* 
\v 15  Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a
band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be
wet with the dew of heaven, and \add let\add* his portion \add be\add*
with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 
\v 16  Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart
be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. 
\v 17  This matter \add is\add* by the decree of the watchers, and the
demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living
may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth
it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
\v 18  This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar,
declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise \add men\add*
of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation:
but thou \add art\add* able; for the spirit of the holy gods \add is\add* in thee.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then Daniel, whose name \add was\add* Belteshazzar, was astonied
for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and
said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof,
trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream
\add be\add* to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine

\v 20  The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
height reached  unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the
earth; 
\v 21  Whose leaves \add were\add* fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
\add was\add* meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
\v 22 It \add is\add* thou, O king, that art grown and become strong:
for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion
to the end of the earth. 
\v 23  And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming
down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a
band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be
wet with the dew of heaven, and \add let\add* his portion \add be\add*
with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; 
\v 24  This \add is\add* the interpretation, O king, and this \add is\add*
the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
\v 25  That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall
be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat
grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and
seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High
ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\v 26  And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have
known that the heavens do rule. 
\v 27  Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee,
and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing
mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.\f + \fr 4.27 
\ft a lengthening…: or, an healing of thine error\f* 
\p
\v 28 ¶ All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 
\v 29  At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
kingdom of Babylon.\f + \fr 4.29  \ft in: or, upon\f* 
\v 30  The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that
I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power,
and for the honour of my majesty? 
\v 31  While the word \add was\add* in the king’s mouth, there fell
a voice from heaven, \add saying\add*, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. 
\v 32  And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling \add shall
be\add* with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat
grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know
that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will. 
\v 33  The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar:
and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body
was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’
\add feathers\add*, and his nails like birds’ \add claws\add*. 
\p
\v 34  And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I
blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth
for ever, whose dominion \add is\add* an everlasting dominion, and his
kingdom \add is\add* from generation to generation: 
\v 35  And all the inhabitants of the earth \add are\add* reputed
as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
\add among\add* the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his
hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? 
\v 36  At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory
of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my
counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my
kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. 
\v 37  Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King
of heaven, all whose works \add are\add* truth, and his ways judgment:
and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
\v 2  Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken
out of the temple which \add was\add* in Jerusalem; that the king,
and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.\f + \fr 5.2 
\ft father: or, grandfather\f*\f + \fr 5.2  \ft taken: Chaldee, brought

\v 3  Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
the temple of the house of God which \add was\add* at Jerusalem;
and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
\v 4  They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote
over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\v 6  Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote
 one against another.\f + \fr 5.6  \ft countenance: Chaldee, brightnesses\f*\f + \fr 5.6 
\ft was changed: Chaldee, changed it\f*\f + \fr 5.6  \ft joints: or, girdles: Chaldee, bindings, or,

\v 7  The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers. \add And\add* the king spake, and said to the
wise \add men\add* of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing,
and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and
\add have\add* a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third
ruler in the kingdom.\f + \fr 5.7  \ft aloud: Chaldee, with might\f*\f + \fr 5.7 
\ft scarlet: or, purple\f* 
\v 8  Then came in all the king’s wise \add men:\add* but they could
not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
\v 9  Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance
was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.\f + \fr 5.9  \ft countenance: Chaldee,

\p
\v 10 ¶ \add Now\add* the queen, by reason of the words of the king
and his lords, came into the banquet house: \add and\add* the queen
spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble
thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: 
\v 11  There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom \add is\add* the spirit
of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding
and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the
king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, \add I say\add*, thy father,
made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, \add and\add*
soothsayers;\f + \fr 5.11  \ft father: or, grandfather\f* 
\v 12  Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,

of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar:
now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.\f + \fr 5.12 
\ft interpreting: or, of an interpreter\f*\f + \fr 5.12  \ft dissolving: or, of a

\v 13  Then was Daniel brought in before the king. \add And\add*
the king spake and said unto Daniel, \add Art\add* thou that Daniel, which
\add art\add* of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the
king my father brought out of Jewry?\f + \fr 5.13  \ft father: or,

\v 14  I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods \add is\add*
in thee, and \add that\add* light and understanding and excellent
wisdom is found in thee. 
\v 15  And now the wise \add men\add*, the astrologers, have been
brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make
known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew
the interpretation of the thing: 
\v 16  And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations,
and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make
known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with
scarlet, and \add have\add* a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the
third ruler in the kingdom.\f + \fr 5.16  \ft make interpretations: Chaldee, interpret,
etc\f* 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the
writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.\f + \fr 5.17 
\ft rewards: or, fee\f* 
\v 18  O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 
\v 19  And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations,
and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew;
and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he
would he put down. 
\v 20  But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory
from him:\f + \fr 5.20  \ft in pride: or, to deal proudly\f*\f + \fr 5.20 
\ft deposed: Chaldee, made to come down\f* 
\v 21  And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was
made like the beasts, and his dwelling \add was\add* with the wild
asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the
dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom
of men, and \add that\add* he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.\f + \fr 5.21 
\ft his heart…: or, he made his heart equal, etc\f* 
\v 22  And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
though thou knewest all this; 
\v 23  But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have
brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords,
thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast
praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone,
which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy
breath \add is\add*, and whose \add are\add* all thy ways, hast thou
not glorified: 
\v 24  Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
was written. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And this \add is\add* the writing that was written, MENE,
MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 
\v 26  This \add is\add* the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God
hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. 
\v 27  TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
\v 28  PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
Persians. 
\v 29  Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and
\add put\add* a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation
concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\p
\v 30 ¶ In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
\v 31  And Darius the Median took the kingdom, \add being\add* about
threescore and two years old.\f + \fr 5.31  \ft being…: Chaldee, he as the son of,
etc\f*\f + \fr 5.31  \ft about: or, now\f* 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 
\v 2  And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel \add was\add*
first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
should have no damage. 
\v 3  Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
because an excellent spirit \add was\add* in him; and the king thought
to set him over the whole realm. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against
Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion
nor fault; forasmuch as he \add was\add* faithful, neither was there
any error or fault found in him. 
\v 5  Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
this Daniel, except we find \add it\add* against him concerning the
law of his God. 
\p
\v 6  Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.\f + \fr 6.6 
\ft assembled…: or, came tumultuously\f* 
\v 7  All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,
the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish
a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall
ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O
king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.\f + \fr 6.7  \ft decree: or,
interdict\f* 
\v 8  Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be
not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which
altereth not.\f + \fr 6.8  \ft altereth not: Chaldee, passeth not\f*
\v 9  Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went
into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed,
and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 
\p
\v 11  Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
supplication before his God. 
\v 12  Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning
the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man
that shall ask \add a petition\add* of any God or man within thirty
days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?
The king answered and said, The thing \add is\add* true, according to the
law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
\v 13  Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which
\add is\add* of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh
his petition three times a day. 
\v 14  Then the king, when he heard \add these\add* words, was sore
displeased with himself, and set \add his\add* heart on Daniel to
deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
\v 15  Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians \add is\add*,
That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
\v 16  Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast
\add him\add* into the den of lions. \add Now\add* the king spake
and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will
deliver thee. 
\v 17  And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his
lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep
went from him.\f + \fr 6.18  \ft instruments…: or, table\f* 
\v 19  Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
haste unto the den of lions. 
\v 20  And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
unto Daniel: \add and\add* the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually,
able to deliver thee from the lions? 
\v 21  Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
\v 22  My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths,
that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was
found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. 
\v 23  Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should
take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the
den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed
in his God. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
accused Daniel, and they cast \add them\add* into the den of lions,
them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery
of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the
bottom of the den. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
\v 26  I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he \add is\add* the
living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom \add that\add*
which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion \add shall be even\add*
unto the end. 
\v 27  He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power
of the lions.\f + \fr 6.27  \ft power: Chaldee, hand\f* 
\v 28  So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
reign of Cyrus the Persian. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had
a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream,
\add and\add* told the sum of the matters.\f + \fr 7.1  \ft had: Chaldee,
saw\f*\f + \fr 7.1  \ft matters: or, words\f* 
\v 2  Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 
\v 3  And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
another. 
\v 4  The first \add was\add* like a lion, and had eagle’s wings:
I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up
from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s
heart was given to it.\f + \fr 7.4  \ft and it: or, wherewith it\f*
\v 5  And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
up itself on one side, and \add it had\add* three ribs in the mouth
of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise,
devour much flesh.\f + \fr 7.5  \ft it raised…: or, it raised up one
dominion\f* 
\v 6  After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four
heads; and dominion was given to it. 
\v 7  After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had
great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the
residue with the feet of it: and it \add was\add* diverse from all
the beasts that \add were\add* before it; and it had ten horns. 
\v 8  I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn \add were\add*
eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient
of days did sit, whose garment \add was\add* white as snow, and the
hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne \add was like\add*
the fiery flame, \add and\add* his wheels \add as\add* burning fire.
\v 10  A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
\v 11  I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake: I beheld \add even\add* till the beast was slain, and his
body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. 
\v 12  As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.\f + \fr 7.12 
\ft their lives…: Chaldee, a prolonging in life was given them\f*
\v 13  I saw in the night visions, and, behold, \add one\add* like the
Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient

\v 14  And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion
\add is\add* an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,
and his kingdom \add that\add* which shall not be destroyed. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of \add my\add*

\v 16  I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him
the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation
of the things. 
\v 17  These great beasts, which are four, \add are\add* four kings,
\add which\add* shall arise out of the earth. 
\v 18  But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.\f + \fr 7.18 
\ft most…: Chaldee, high ones, that is, things, or, places\f* 
\v 19  Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth \add were
of\add* iron, and his nails \add of\add* brass; \add which\add* devoured,
brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;\f + \fr 7.19 
\ft from…: Chaldee, from all those\f* 
\v 20  And of the ten horns that \add were\add* in his head, and
\add of\add* the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even
\add of\add* that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great
things, whose look \add was\add* more stout than his fellows. 
\v 21  I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
prevailed against them; 
\v 22  Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed
the kingdom. 
\v 23  Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour
the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\v 24  And the ten horns out of this kingdom \add are\add* ten kings
\add that\add* shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be
diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. 
\v 25  And he shall speak \add great\add* words against the most
High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to
change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until
a time and times and the dividing of time. 
\v 26  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion,
to consume and to destroy \add it\add* unto the end. 
\v 27  And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints
of the most High, whose kingdom \add is\add* an everlasting kingdom,
and all dominions shall serve and obey him.\f + \fr 7.27  \ft dominions: or,

\v 28  Hitherto \add is\add* the end of the matter. As for me Daniel,
my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me:
but I kept the matter in my heart. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
appeared unto me, \add even unto\add* me Daniel, after that which
appeared unto me at the first. 
\v 2  And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
\add was\add* at Shushan \add in\add* the palace, which \add is\add*
in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the
river of Ulai. 
\v 3  Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
before the river a ram which had \add two\add* horns: and the \add two\add*
horns \add were\add* high; but one \add was\add* higher than the
other, and the higher came up last.\f + \fr 8.3  \ft the other: Heb. the
second\f* 
\v 4  I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
so that no beasts might stand before him, neither \add was there
any\add* that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his
will, and became great. 
\v 5  And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the
west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground:
and the goat \add had\add* a notable horn between his eyes.\f + \fr 8.5 
\ft touched…: or, none touched him in the earth\f*\f + \fr 8.5  \ft a notable…: Heb. a horn of
sight\f* 
\v 6  And he came to the ram that had \add two\add* horns, which I had
seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
power. 
\v 7  And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no
power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the
ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver
the ram out of his hand. 
\v 8  Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,
the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the
four winds of heaven. 
\v 9  And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the
pleasant \add land\add*. 
\v 10  And it waxed great, \add even\add* to the host of heaven;
and it cast down \add some\add* of the host and of the stars to the
ground, and stamped upon them.\f + \fr 8.10  \ft to the host: or, against the
host\f* 
\v 11  Yea, he magnified \add himself\add* even to the prince of the
host, and by him the daily \add sacrifice\add* was taken away, and the
place of his sanctuary was cast down.\f + \fr 8.11  \ft to: or, against\f*\f + \fr 8.11 
\ft by him: or, from him\f* 
\v 12  And an host was given \add him\add* against the daily \add sacrifice\add*
by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground;
and it practised, and prospered.\f + \fr 8.12  \ft an host…: or, the host was given over for the transgression against the
daily sacrifice\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
certain \add saint\add* which spake, How long \add shall be\add*
the vision \add concerning\add* the daily \add sacrifice\add*, and the
transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host
to be trodden under foot?\f + \fr 8.13  \ft that…: or, the numberer of secrets, or, the wonderful numberer: Heb.

then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\f + \fr 8.14  \ft days: Heb. evening

\p
\v 15 ¶ And it came to pass, when I, \add even\add* I Daniel, had
seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there
stood before me as the appearance of a man. 
\v 16  And I heard a man’s voice between \add the banks of\add* Ulai,
which called, and said, Gabriel, make this \add man\add* to understand
the vision. 
\v 17  So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of
man: for at the time of the end \add shall be\add* the vision. 
\v 18  Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my
face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.\f + \fr 8.18

\v 19  And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last

be\add*. 
\v 20  The ram which thou sawest having \add two\add* horns \add are\add*
the kings of Media and Persia. 
\v 21  And the rough goat \add is\add* the king of Grecia: and the

king. 
\v 22  Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
\v 23  And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding
dark sentences, shall stand up.\f + \fr 8.23  \ft are…: Heb. are

\v 25  And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper
in his hand; and he shall magnify \add himself\add* in his heart,
and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.\f + \fr 8.25

\v 26  And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
\add is\add* true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it \add shall

\v 27  And I Daniel fainted, and was sick \add certain\add* days;

at the vision, but none understood \add it\add*.

\p
\v 3 ¶ And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 
\p
\v 4  And I prayed unto the \nd LORD\nd* my God, and made my confession,
and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant
and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
\v 5  We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts
and from thy judgments: 
\v 6  Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which

\v 7  O Lord, righteousness \add belongeth\add* unto thee, but unto us

though we have rebelled against him; 
\v 10  Neither have we obeyed the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God,
to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
\v 11  Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured
upon us, and the oath that \add is\add* written in the law of Moses
the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. 
\v 12  And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our
judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole
heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. 
\v 13 As \add it is\add* written in the law of Moses, all this evil
is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the \nd LORD\nd*

in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice. 
\v 15  And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee

\v 16 ¶ O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine

Jerusalem and thy people \add are become\add* a reproach to all \add that

\v 17  Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant,
and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary
that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. 
\v 18  O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name:

\v 1  In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed

\v 4  And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the

\v 7  And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they
fled to hide themselves. 
\v 8  Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into

\v 16 And, behold, \add one\add* like the similitude of the sons
of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said
unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows

\v 20  Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I
return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth,

\v 2  And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
