\mt1 THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE GALATIANS 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
\v 2  And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
Galatia: 
\v 3  Grace \add be\add* to you and peace from God the Father, and
\add from\add* our Lord Jesus Christ, 
\v 4  Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
\v 5  To whom \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
\p
\v 6  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you
into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 
\v 7  Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
\v 8  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
\v 9  As we said before, so say I now again, If any \add man\add*
preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him
be accursed. 
\p
\v 10  For do I now persuade  men, or God? or do I seek to please
men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
\v 11  But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
of me is not after man. 
\v 12  For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught \add it\add*,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
\v 13  For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God,
and wasted it: 
\v 14  And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in
mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions
of my fathers. 
\v 15  But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s
womb, and called \add me\add* by his grace, 
\v 16  To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
\v 17  Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
\v 18  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
and abode with him fifteen days. 
\v 19  But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s
brother. 
\v 20  Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God,
I lie not. 
\v 21  Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 
\v 22  And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which
were in Christ: 
\v 23  But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
\v 24  And they glorified God in me. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, and took Titus with \add me\add* also. 
\v 2  And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which
were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in
vain. 
\v 3  But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
to be circumcised: 
\v 4  And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus,
that they might bring us into bondage: 
\v 5  To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that
the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
\v 6  But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were,
it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they
who seemed \add to be somewhat\add* in conference added nothing to
me: 
\v 7  But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision
was committed unto me, as \add the gospel\add* of the circumcision
\add was\add* unto Peter; 
\v 8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship
of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
\v 9  And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas
the right hands of fellowship; that we \add should go\add* unto the
heathen, and they unto the circumcision. 
\v 10  Only \add they would\add* that we should remember the poor;
the same which I also was forward to do. 
\v 11  But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
face, because he was to be blamed. 
\v 12  For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself,
fearing them which were of the circumcision. 
\v 13  And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch
that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. 
\v 14  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to
the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before \add them\add*
all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews? 
\v 15  We \add who are\add* Jews by nature, and not sinners of the
Gentiles, 
\v 16  Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus
Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not
by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh
be justified. 
\v 17  But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
also are found sinners, \add is\add* therefore Christ the minister
of sin? God forbid. 
\v 18  For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
myself a transgressor. 
\v 19  For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live
unto God. 
\v 20  I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh
I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me. 
\v 21  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness
\add come\add* by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should
not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set
forth, crucified among you? 
\v 2  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
\v 3  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
perfect by the flesh? 
\v 4  Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if \add it be\add*
yet in vain. 
\v 5  He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles among you, \add doeth he it\add* by the works of the law,
or by the hearing of faith? 
\v 6  Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
righteousness. 
\p
\v 7  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
the children of Abraham. 
\v 8  And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, \add saying\add*,
In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
\v 9  So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
\v 10  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
for it is written, Cursed \add is\add* every one that continueth
not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
them. 
\v 11  But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
\add it is\add* evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
\v 12  And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
shall live in them. 
\v 13  Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed \add is\add* every one
that hangeth on a tree: 
\v 14  That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith. 
\v 15  Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though \add it
be\add* but a man’s covenant, yet \add if it be\add* confirmed, no
man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. 
\v 16  Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which
is Christ. 
\v 17  And this I say, \add that\add* the covenant, that was confirmed
before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none
effect. 
\v 18  For if the inheritance \add be\add* of the law, \add it is\add*
no more of promise: but God gave \add it\add* to Abraham by promise.
\v 19  Wherefore then \add serveth\add* the law? It was added because
of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was
made; \add and it was\add* ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
\v 20  Now a mediator is not \add a mediator\add* of one, but God
is one. 
\v 21  \add Is\add* the law then against the promises of God? God
forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given
life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. 
\v 22  But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
\p
\v 23  But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
\v 24  Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster \add to bring us\add*
unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
\v 25  But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
\v 26  For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
\v 27  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
on Christ. 
\v 28  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ
Jesus. 
\v 29  And if ye \add be\add* Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed,
and heirs according to the promise. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Now I say, \add That\add* the heir, as long as he is a child,
differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 
\v 2  But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed
of the father. 
\v 3  Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
elements of the world: 
\v 4  But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
\v 5  To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
the adoption of sons. 
\v 6  And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 
\v 7  Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir of God through Christ. 
\p
\v 8  Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them
which by nature are no gods. 
\v 9  But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known
of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto
ye desire again to be in bondage? 
\v 10  Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 
\v 11  I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
vain. 
\p
\v 12  Brethren, I beseech you, be as I \add am\add*; for I \add am\add*
as ye \add are\add*: ye have not injured me at all. 
\v 13  Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
gospel unto you at the first. 
\v 14  And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an angel of God, \add even\add* as Christ
Jesus. 
\v 15  Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you
record, that, if \add it had been\add* possible, ye would have plucked
out your own eyes, and have given them to me. 
\v 16  Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
\v 17  They zealously affect you, \add but\add* not well; yea, they
would exclude you, that ye might affect them. 
\v 18  But \add it is\add* good to be zealously affected always in
\add a\add* good \add thing\add*, and not only when I am present
with you. 
\v 19  My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until
Christ be formed in you, 
\v 20  I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice;
for I stand in doubt of you. 
\p
\v 21  Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
the law? 
\v 22  For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. 
\v 23  But he \add who was\add* of the bondwoman was born after the
flesh; but he of the freewoman \add was\add* by promise. 
\v 24  Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is
Agar. 
\v 25  For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
which now is, and is in bondage with her children. 
\v 26  But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother
of us all. 
\v 27  For it is written, Rejoice, \add thou\add* barren that bearest
not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate
hath many more children than she which hath an husband. 
\v 28  Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
\v 29  But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
\add that was born\add* after the Spirit, even so \add it is\add*
now. 
\v 30  Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with
the son of the freewoman. 
\v 31  So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
of the free. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 
\p
\v 2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
shall profit you nothing. 
\v 3  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that
he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
\v 4  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 
\v 5  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
by faith. 
\v 6  For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
\v 7  Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
the truth? 
\v 8  This persuasion \add cometh\add* not of him that calleth you.
\v 9  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 
\v 10  I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,
whosoever he be. 
\v 11  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. 
\v 12  I would they were even cut off which trouble you. 
\v 13  For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only \add use\add*
not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
\v 14  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, \add even\add* in
this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
\v 15  But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be
not consumed one of another. 
\v 16  \add This\add* I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall
not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 
\v 17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would. 
\v 18  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
\v 19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are \add these\add*;
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 
\v 20  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, 
\v 21  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like:
of the which I tell you before, as I have also told \add you\add* in time past,
that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, 
\v 23  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 
\v 24  And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts. 
\v 25  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
\v 26  Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,
lest thou also be tempted. 
\v 2  Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil  the law of Christ.
\v 3  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing,
he deceiveth himself. 
\v 4  But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
\v 5  For every man shall bear his own burden. 
\v 6  Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things. 
\v 7  Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap. 
\v 8  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption;
but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
\v 9  And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not. 
\v 10  As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
\add men\add*, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
\v 11  Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
own hand. 
\v 12  As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain
you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the
cross of Christ. 
\v 13  For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law;
but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
\v 14  But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world. 
\v 15  For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 
\v 16  And as many as walk according to this rule, peace \add be\add*
on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 
\v 17  From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body
the marks of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 18  Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add*
with your spirit. Amen.
