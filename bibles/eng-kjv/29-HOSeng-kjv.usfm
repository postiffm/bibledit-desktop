\c 1  
\p
\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* that came unto Hosea, the son
of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add* Hezekiah,
kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king
of Israel. 
\p
\v 2  The beginning of the word of the \nd LORD\nd* by Hosea. And the
\nd LORD\nd* said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms
and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom,
\add departing\add* from the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 3  So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived,
and bare him a son. 
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Call his name Jezreel;
for yet a little \add while\add*, and I will avenge the blood of
Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom
of the house of Israel.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft avenge: Heb. visit\f* 
\v 5  And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And \add God\add*
said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have
mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.\f + \fr 1.6 
\ft Lo-ruhamah: that is, Not having obtained mercy\f*\f + \fr 1.6 
\ft no…: Heb. not add any more to\f*\f + \fr 1.6  \ft but…: or, that I should altogether pardon
them\f* 
\v 7  But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
them by the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and will not save them by bow,
nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare
a son. 
\v 9  Then said \add God\add*, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye \add are\add*
not my people, and I will not be your \add God\add*.\f + \fr 1.9 
\ft Lo-ammi: that is, Not my people\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the
sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass,
\add that\add* in the place where it was said unto them, Ye \add are\add*
not my people, \add there\add* it shall be said unto them, \add Ye
are\add* the sons of the living God.\f + \fr 1.10  \ft in…: or, instead of
that\f* 
\v 11  Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel
be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come
up out of the land: for great \add shall be\add* the day of Jezreel.
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah.
\f + \fr 2.1  \ft Ammi: that is, My people\f*\f + \fr 2.1  \ft Ru-hamah: that is, Having obtained
mercy\f* 
\v 2  Plead with your mother, plead: for she \add is\add* not my
wife, neither \add am\add* I her husband: let her therefore put away
her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her
breasts; 
\v 3  Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land,
and slay her with thirst. 
\v 4  And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they \add be\add*
the children of whoredoms. 
\v 5  For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers,
that give \add me\add* my bread and my water, my wool and my flax,
mine oil and my drink.\f + \fr 2.5  \ft drink: Heb. drinks\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft make…: Heb. wall a
wall\f* 
\v 7  And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake
them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find \add them:\add*
then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then
\add was it\add* better with me than now. 
\v 8  For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
and multiplied her silver and gold, \add which\add* they prepared
for Baal.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft wine: Heb. new wine\f*\f + \fr 2.8  \ft which…: or, wherewith they made
Baal\f* 
\v 9  Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool
and my flax \add given\add* to cover her nakedness.\f + \fr 2.9 
\ft recover: or, take away\f* 
\v 10  And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.\f + \fr 2.10  \ft lewdness: Heb. folly, or,
villany\f* 
\v 11  I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days,
her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. 
\v 12  And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
said, These \add are\add* my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will
make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.\f + \fr 2.12 
\ft destroy: Heb. make desolate\f* 
\v 13  And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her
jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.\f + \fr 2.14  \ft comfortably: or, friendly: Heb. to her
heart\f* 
\v 15  And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the
days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the
land of Egypt. 
\v 16  And it shall be at that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, \add that\add*
thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.\f + \fr 2.16 
\ft Ishi: that is, My husband\f*\f + \fr 2.16  \ft Baali: that is, My
lord\f* 
\v 17  For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth,
and they shall no more be remembered by their name. 
\v 18  And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts
of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and \add with\add* the creeping
things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the
battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. 
\v 19  And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness,
and in mercies. 
\v 20  I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt
know the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 21  And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the
earth; 
\v 22  And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
and they shall hear Jezreel. 
\v 23  And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to \add them which
were\add* not my people, Thou \add art\add* my people; and they shall
say, \add Thou art\add* my God. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Then said the \nd LORD\nd* unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
\add her\add* friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
\nd LORD\nd* toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
and love flagons of wine.\f + \fr 3.1  \ft of wine: Heb. of grapes\f*
\v 2  So I bought her to me for fifteen \add pieces\add* of silver, and
\add for\add* an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:\f + \fr 3.2 
\ft half…: Heb. lethech\f* 
\v 3  And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the
harlot, and thou shalt not be for \add another\add* man: so \add will\add* I also
\add be\add* for thee. 
\v 4  For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an
image, and without an ephod, and \add without\add* teraphim:\f + \fr 3.4 
\ft image: Heb. a standing, or, statue, or, pillar\f* 
\v 5  Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
\nd LORD\nd* their God, and David their king; and shall fear the
\nd LORD\nd* and his goodness in the latter days. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, ye children of Israel: for the
\nd LORD\nd* hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
\add there is\add* no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
land. 
\v 2  By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.\f + \fr 4.2 
\ft blood: Heb. bloods\f* 
\v 3  Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the
fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
\v 4  Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people
\add are\add* as they that strive with the priest. 
\v 5  Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall
fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.\f + \fr 4.5 
\ft destroy: Heb. cut off\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no
priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also
forget thy children.\f + \fr 4.6  \ft destroyed: Heb. cut off\f*
\v 7  As they were increased, so they sinned against me: \add therefore\add*
will I change their glory into shame. 
\v 8  They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart
on their iniquity.\f + \fr 4.8  \ft set…: Heb. lift up their soul
to\f* 
\v 9  And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish
them for their ways, and reward them their doings.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft punish: Heb. visit
upon\f*\f + \fr 4.9  \ft reward: Heb. cause to return\f* 
\v 10  For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take
heed to the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 11  Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth
unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused \add them\add*
to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. 
\v 13  They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense
upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof
\add is\add* good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom,
and your spouses shall commit adultery. 
\v 14  I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated
with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people
\add that\add* doth not understand shall fall.\f + \fr 4.14  \ft I will not: or, Shall I
not\f*\f + \fr 4.14  \ft fall: or, be punished\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, \add yet\add* let not
Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven,
nor swear, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth. 
\v 16  For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the \nd LORD\nd*
will feed them as a lamb in a large place. 
\v 17  Ephraim \add is\add* joined to idols: let him alone. 
\v 18  Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
her rulers \add with\add* shame do love, Give ye.\f + \fr 4.18  \ft sour: Heb.
gone\f*\f + \fr 4.18  \ft rulers: Heb. shields\f* 
\v 19  The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
ashamed because of their sacrifices. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye
ear, O house of the king; for judgment \add is\add* toward you, because ye have been a
snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
\v 2  And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
\add have been\add* a rebuker of them all.\f + \fr 5.2  \ft though: or,
and\f*\f + \fr 5.2  \ft a rebuker: Heb. a correction\f* 
\v 3  I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
thou committest whoredom, \add and\add* Israel is defiled. 
\v 4  They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the
spirit of whoredoms \add is\add* in the midst of them, and they have not
known the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 5.4  \ft They will…: or, Their doings will not suffer
them\f*\f + \fr 5.4  \ft frame: Heb. give\f* 
\v 5  And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall
Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.
\v 6  They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
the \nd LORD\nd*; but they shall not find \add him;\add* he hath
withdrawn himself from them. 
\v 7  They have dealt treacherously against the \nd LORD\nd*: for they have
begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their
portions. 
\p
\v 8  Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, \add and\add* the trumpet in
Ramah: cry aloud \add at\add* Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
\v 9  Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes
of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
\v 10  The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
\add therefore\add* I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
\v 11  Ephraim \add is\add* oppressed  \add and\add* broken in judgment,
because he willingly walked after the commandment. 
\v 12 Therefore \add will\add* I \add be\add* unto Ephraim as a moth,
and to the house of Judah as rottenness.\f + \fr 5.12  \ft rottenness: or, a
worm\f* 
\v 13  When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah \add saw\add* his
wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb:
yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.\f + \fr 5.13 
\ft king Jareb: or, the king of Jareb: or, the king that should plead\f*
\v 14 For I \add will be\add* unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young
lion to the house of Judah: I, \add even\add* I, will tear and go
away; I will take away, and none shall rescue \add him\add*. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ I will go \add and\add* return to my place, till they acknowledge their
offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me
early.\f + \fr 5.15  \ft acknowledge…: Heb. be guilty\f* 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Come, and let us return unto the \nd LORD\nd*: for he hath
torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
\v 2  After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us
up, and we shall live in his sight. 
\v 3  Then shall we know, \add if\add* we follow on to know the \nd LORD\nd*:
his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the
rain, as the latter \add and\add* former rain unto the earth. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I
do unto thee? for your goodness \add is\add* as a morning cloud,
and as the early dew it goeth away.\f + \fr 6.4  \ft goodness: or, mercy, or,
kindness\f* 
\v 5  Therefore have I hewed \add them\add* by the prophets; I have
slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments \add are as\add*
the light \add that\add* goeth forth.\f + \fr 6.5  \ft and…: or, that thy judgments might be,
etc\f* 
\v 6  For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
God more than burnt offerings. 
\v 7  But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt
treacherously against me.\f + \fr 6.7  \ft men: or, Adam\f* 
\v 8  Gilead \add is\add* a city of them that work iniquity, \add and
is\add* polluted with blood.\f + \fr 6.8  \ft polluted: or, cunning
for\f* 
\v 9  And as troops of robbers wait for a man, \add so\add* the company
of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.\f + \fr 6.9 
\ft by…: Heb. with one shoulder, or, to Shechem\f*\f + \fr 6.9  \ft lewdness: or,
enormity\f* 
\v 10  I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there
\add is\add* the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
\v 11  Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned
the captivity of my people. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood;
and the thief cometh in, \add and\add* the troop of robbers spoileth
without.\f + \fr 7.1  \ft wickedness: Heb. evils\f*\f + \fr 7.1 
\ft spoileth: Heb. strippeth\f* 
\v 2  And they consider not in their hearts \add that\add* I remember
all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
they are before my face.\f + \fr 7.2  \ft consider…: Heb. say not
to\f* 
\v 3  They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
with their lies. 
\v 4 They \add are\add* all adulterers, as an oven heated by the
baker, \add who\add* ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the
dough, until it be leavened.\f + \fr 7.4  \ft who…: or, the raiser will
cease\f*\f + \fr 7.4  \ft raising: or, waking\f* 
\v 5  In the day of our king the princes have made \add him\add*
sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.\f + \fr 7.5 
\ft bottles…: or, heat through wine\f* 
\v 6  For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in
wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth
as a flaming fire.\f + \fr 7.6  \ft made…: or, applied\f* 
\v 7  They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
all their kings are fallen: \add there is\add* none among them that
calleth unto me. 
\p
\v 8  Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a
cake not turned. 
\v 9  Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth \add it\add*
not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
not.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft here…: Heb. sprinkled\f* 
\v 10  And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not
return to the \nd LORD\nd* their God, nor seek him for all this.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call
to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 
\v 12  When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them
down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation
hath heard. 
\v 13  Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have
transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have
spoken lies against me.\f + \fr 7.13  \ft destruction: Heb. spoil\f*
\v 14  And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine,
\add and\add* they rebel against me. 
\v 15  Though I have bound \add and\add* strengthened their arms,
yet do they imagine mischief against me.\f + \fr 7.15  \ft have…: or,
chastened\f* 
\v 16  They return, \add but\add* not to the most High: they are like a
deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage
of their tongue: this \add shall be\add* their derision in the land
of Egypt. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  \add Set\add* the trumpet to thy mouth. \add He shall come\add*
as an eagle against the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, because they have
transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.\f + \fr 8.1 
\ft thy: Heb. the roof of thy\f* 
\v 2  Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. 
\v 3  Israel hath cast off \add the thing that is\add* good: the
enemy shall pursue him. 
\v 4  They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes,
and I knew \add it\add* not: of their silver and their gold have they
made them idols, that they may be cut off. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast \add thee\add* off; mine anger
is kindled against them: how long \add will it be\add* ere they attain
to innocency? 
\v 6  For from Israel \add was\add* it also: the workman made it; therefore it
\add is\add* not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in
pieces. 
\v 7  For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind:
it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield,
the strangers shall swallow it up.\f + \fr 8.7  \ft stalk: or, standing
corn\f* 
\p
\v 8  Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
as a vessel wherein \add is\add* no pleasure. 
\v 9  For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
Ephraim hath hired lovers.\f + \fr 8.9  \ft lovers: Heb. loves\f*
\v 10  Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I

\v 12  I have written to him the great things of my law, \add but\add*
they were counted as a strange thing. 
\v 13  They sacrifice flesh \add for\add* the sacrifices of mine

remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return
to Egypt.\f + \fr 8.13  \ft They sacrifice…: or, In the sacrifices of mine offerings they,

\v 14  For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples;
and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his

\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as \add other\add* people:
for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward
upon every cornfloor.\f + \fr 9.1  \ft upon: or, in, etc\f* 
\v 2  The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new

\v 3  They shall not dwell in the \nd LORD’s\nd* land; but Ephraim
shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean \add things\add*
in Assyria. 
\v 4  They shall not offer wine \add offerings\add* to the \nd LORD\nd*,
neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices \add shall
be\add* unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 5  What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast
of the \nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 6  For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them
up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant \add places\add* for their
silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns \add shall be\add* in their
tabernacles.\f + \fr 9.6  \ft destruction: Heb. spoil\f*\f + \fr 9.6

\p
\v 7  The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
come; Israel shall know \add it:\add* the prophet \add is\add* a

\v 8  The watchman of Ephraim \add was\add* with my God: \add but\add*

\v 10  I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers
as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: \add but\add*
they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto \add that\add*
shame; and \add their\add* abominations were according as they loved.
\p
\v 11  \add As for\add* Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a

\v 12  Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
\add that there shall\add* not \add be\add* a man \add left:\add*
yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! 
\v 13  Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, \add is\add* planted in a pleasant

\v 4  They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant:
thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
