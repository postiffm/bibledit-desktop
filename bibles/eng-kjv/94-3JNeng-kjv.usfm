\v 1  The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
\p
\v 2  Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
\v 3  For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
\v 4  I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
truth. 
\v 5  Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
brethren, and to strangers; 
\v 6  Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt
do well: 
\v 7  Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing
of the Gentiles. 
\v 8  We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to
the truth. 
\p
\v 9  I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
preeminence among them, receiveth us not. 
\v 10  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith,
neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that
would, and casteth \add them\add* out of the church. 
\p
\v 11  Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not
seen God. 
\v 12  Demetrius hath good report of all \add men\add*, and of the
truth itself: yea, and we \add also\add* bear record; and ye know
that our record is true. 
\p
\v 13  I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
write unto thee: 
\v 14  But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
to face. Peace \add be\add* to thee. \add Our\add* friends salute
thee. Greet the friends by name.
