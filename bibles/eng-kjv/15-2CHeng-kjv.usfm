\v 1  And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
and the \nd LORD\nd* his God \add was\add* with him, and magnified
him exceedingly. 
\v 2  Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands
and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all
Israel, the chief of the fathers. 
\v 3  So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high
place that \add was\add* at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle
of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*
had made in the wilderness. 
\v 4  But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to
\add the place which\add* David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
\v 5  Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*:
and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.\f + \fr 1.5  \ft he put: or, was
there\f* 
\v 6  And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
\nd LORD\nd*, which \add was\add* at the tabernacle of the congregation,
and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
Ask what I shall give thee. 
\v 8  And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. 
\v 9  Now, O \nd LORD\nd* God, let thy promise unto David my father
be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
dust of the earth in multitude.\f + \fr 1.9  \ft like…: Heb. much as the dust of the
earth\f* 
\v 10  Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, \add that is
so\add* great? 
\v 11  And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart,
and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine
enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom
and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee
king: 
\v 12  Wisdom and knowledge \add is\add* granted unto thee; and I will
give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that
\add have been\add* before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then Solomon came \add from his journey\add* to the high
place that \add was\add* at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the
tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. 
\v 14  And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand
and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he
placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
\v 15  And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem \add as plenteous\add*
as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that \add are\add*
in the vale for abundance.\f + \fr 1.15  \ft made: Heb. gave\f* 
\v 16  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.\f + \fr 1.16 
\ft Solomon…: Heb. the going forth of the horses which was Solomon’s\f*
\v 17  And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
for six hundred \add shekels\add* of silver, and an horse for an
hundred and fifty: and so brought they out \add horses\add* for all the
kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft means: Heb. hand\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
\nd LORD\nd*, and an house for his kingdom. 
\v 2  And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three
thousand and six hundred to oversee them. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst
deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an
house to dwell therein, \add even so deal with me\add*.\f + \fr 2.3 
\ft Huram: or, Hiram\f* 
\v 4  Behold, I build an house to the name of the \nd LORD\nd* my
God, to dedicate \add it\add* to him, \add and\add* to burn before
him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt
offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
and on the solemn feasts of the \nd LORD\nd* our God. This \add is an
ordinance\add* for ever to Israel.\f + \fr 2.4  \ft sweet…: Heb. incense of
spices\f* 
\v 5  And the house which I build \add is\add* great: for great \add is\add*
our God above all gods. 
\v 6  But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who \add am\add* I then, that I should
build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?\f + \fr 2.6 
\ft is able: Heb. hath retained, or, obtained strength\f* 
\v 7  Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and
blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that \add are\add*
with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.\f + \fr 2.7 
\ft to grave: Heb. to grave gravings\f* 
\v 8  Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in
Lebanon; and, behold, my servants \add shall be\add* with thy servants,\f + \fr 2.8 
\ft algum: also called, almuggim\f* 
\v 9  Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to
build \add shall be\add* wonderful great.\f + \fr 2.9  \ft wonderful…: Heb. great and
wonderful\f* 
\v 10  And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that
cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and
twenty thousand baths of oil. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he
sent to Solomon, Because the \nd LORD\nd* hath loved his people,
he hath made thee king over them. 
\v 12  Huram said moreover, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David
the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might
build an house for the \nd LORD\nd*, and an house for his kingdom.\f + \fr 2.12 
\ft endued…: Heb. knowing prudence and understanding\f* 
\v 13  And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
of Huram my father’s, 
\v 14  The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father
\add was\add* a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver,
in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine
linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find
out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men,
and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father. 
\v 15  Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
\v 16  And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it
up to Jerusalem.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft as much…: Heb according to all thy
need\f*\f + \fr 2.16  \ft Joppa: Heb. Japho\f* 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Solomon numbered all the strangers that \add were\add*
in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father
had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand
and three thousand and six hundred.\f + \fr 2.17  \ft the strangers: Heb. the men the
strangers\f* 
\v 18  And he set threescore and ten thousand of them \add to be\add*
bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand \add to be\add* hewers
in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to
set the people a work. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Then Solomon began to build the house of the \nd LORD\nd* at
Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where \add the \+nd Lord\+nd*\add* appeared
unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the
threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.\f + \fr 3.1  \ft where…: or, which was seen of David his
father\f*\f + \fr 3.1  \ft Ornan: also called, Araunah\f* 
\v 2  And he began to build in the second \add day\add* of the second
month, in the fourth year of his reign. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ Now these \add are the things wherein\add* Solomon was instructed
for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the
first measure \add was\add* threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty
cubits.\f + \fr 3.3  \ft instructed: Heb. founded\f* 
\v 4  And the porch that \add was\add* in the front \add of the house\add*,
the length \add of it was\add* according to the breadth of the house,
twenty cubits, and the height \add was\add* an hundred and twenty:
and he overlaid it within with pure gold. 
\v 5  And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid
with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains. 
\v 6  And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
and the gold \add was\add* gold of Parvaim.\f + \fr 3.6  \ft garnished: Heb.
covered\f* 
\v 7  He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the
walls. 
\v 8  And he made the most holy house, the length whereof \add was\add*
according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth
thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, \add amounting\add*
to six hundred talents. 
\v 9  And the weight of the nails \add was\add* fifty shekels of
gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold. 
\p
\v 10  And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
work, and overlaid them with gold.\f + \fr 3.10  \ft image…: or, (as some think) of moveable
work\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the wings of the cherubims \add were\add* twenty cubits
long: one wing \add of the one cherub was\add* five cubits, reaching
to the wall of the house: and the other wing \add was likewise\add*
five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 
\v 12 And \add one\add* wing of the other cherub \add was\add* five
cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing \add was\add*
five cubits \add also\add*, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\v 13  The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces \add were\add*
inward.\f + \fr 3.13  \ft inward: or, toward the house\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he made the vail \add of\add* blue, and purple, and crimson,
and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.\f + \fr 3.14  \ft wrought: Heb. caused to
ascend\f* 
\v 15  Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
cubits high, and the chapiter that \add was\add* on the top of each of them
\add was\add* five cubits.\f + \fr 3.15  \ft high: Heb. long\f* 
\v 16  And he made chains, \add as\add* in the oracle, and put \add them\add*
on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
put \add them\add* on the chains. 
\v 17  And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right
hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right
hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.\f + \fr 3.17 
\ft Jachin: that is, He shall establish\f*\f + \fr 3.17  \ft Boaz: that is, In it is
strength\f* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the
height thereof. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line
of thirty cubits did compass it round about.\f + \fr 4.2  \ft from…: Heb. from his brim to his
brim\f* 
\v 3 And under it \add was\add* the similitude of oxen, which did
compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round
about. Two rows of oxen \add were\add* cast, when it was cast. 
\v 4  It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north,
and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south,
and three looking toward the east: and the sea \add was set\add*
above upon them, and all their hinder parts \add were\add* inward.
\v 5  And the thickness of it \add was\add* an handbreadth, and the
brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
\add and\add* it received and held three thousand baths.\f + \fr 4.5 
\ft with flowers…: or, like a lilyflower\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt
offering they washed in them; but the sea \add was\add* for the priests
to wash in.\f + \fr 4.6  \ft such…: Heb. the work of burnt offering\f*
\v 7  And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
and set \add them\add* in the temple, five on the right hand, and
five on the left. 
\v 8  He made also ten tables, and placed \add them\add* in the temple,
five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred
basons of gold.\f + \fr 4.8  \ft basons: or, bowls\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with
brass. 
\v 10  And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
against the south. 
\p
\v 11  And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons.
And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
for the house of God;\f + \fr 4.11  \ft basons: or, bowls\f*\f + \fr 4.11 
\ft finished: Heb. finished to make\f* 
\v 12  \add To wit\add*, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the
chapiters \add which were\add* on the top of the two pillars, and the
two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which \add were\add*
on the top of the pillars; 
\v 13  And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows
of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which
\add were\add* upon the pillars.\f + \fr 4.13  \ft upon: Heb. upon the face
of\f* 
\v 14  He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;\f + \fr 4.14 
\ft lavers: or, caldrons\f* 
\v 15  One sea, and twelve oxen under it. 
\v 16  The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house
of the \nd LORD\nd* of bright brass.\f + \fr 4.16  \ft bright: Heb. made bright, or,
scoured\f* 
\v 17  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.\f + \fr 4.17  \ft clay…: Heb. thicknesses of the
ground\f* 
\v 18  Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
weight of the brass could not be found out. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Solomon made all the vessels that \add were for\add*
the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
shewbread \add was set;\add* 
\v 20  Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 
\v 21  And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, \add made he
of\add* gold, \add and\add* that perfect gold;\f + \fr 4.21  \ft perfect…: Heb. perfections of
gold\f* 
\v 22  And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
censers, \add of\add* pure gold: and the entry of the house, the
inner doors thereof for the most holy \add place\add*, and the doors
of the house of the temple, \add were of\add* gold.\f + \fr 4.22 
\ft basons: or, bowls\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the \nd LORD\nd*
was finished: and Solomon brought in \add all\add* the things that
David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the
instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel,
unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*
out of the city of David, which \add is\add* Zion. 
\v 3  Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
king in the feast which \add was\add* in the seventh month. 
\v 4  And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up
the ark. 
\v 5  And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation,
and all the holy vessels that \add were\add* in the tabernacle, these did the
priests \add and\add* the Levites bring up. 
\v 6  Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be
told nor numbered for multitude. 
\v 7  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*
unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy \add place,
even\add* under the wings of the cherubims: 
\v 8  For the cherubims spread forth \add their\add* wings over the
place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
thereof above. 
\v 9  And they drew out the staves \add of the ark\add*, that the
ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not
seen without. And there it is unto this day.\f + \fr 5.9  \ft there…: or, they are
there\f* 
\v 10  \add There was\add* nothing in the ark save the two tables
which Moses put \add therein\add* at Horeb, when the \nd LORD\nd*
made \add a covenant\add* with the children of Israel, when they came
out of Egypt.\f + \fr 5.10  \ft when the \+nd LORD\+nd*: or, where,
etc\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
holy \add place:\add* (for all the priests \add that were\add* present
were sanctified, \add and\add* did not \add then\add* wait by course:\f + \fr 5.11 
\ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 12  Also the Levites \add which were\add* the singers, all of them of
Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
\add being\add* arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred
and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 
\v 13  It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers \add were\add*
as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the
\nd LORD\nd*; and when they lifted up \add their\add* voice with the
trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add saying\add*, For \add he is\add* good; for his mercy \add endureth\add*
for ever: that \add then\add* the house was filled with a cloud,
\add even\add* the house of the \nd LORD\nd*; 
\v 14  So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason
of the cloud: for the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* had filled the house
of God. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Then said Solomon, The \nd LORD\nd* hath said that he would
dwell in the thick darkness. 
\v 2  But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
for thy dwelling for ever. 
\v 3  And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation
of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. 
\v 4  And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
who hath with his hands fulfilled \add that\add* which he spake with his
mouth to my father David, saying, 
\v 5  Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build
an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man
to be a ruler over my people Israel: 
\v 6  But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have
chosen David to be over my people Israel. 
\v 7  Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
for the name of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 8  But the \nd LORD\nd* said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine
heart: 
\v 9  Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
for my name. 
\v 10  The \nd LORD\nd* therefore hath performed his word that he hath
spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am
set on the throne of Israel, as the \nd LORD\nd* promised, and have
built the house for the name of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 11  And in it have I put the ark, wherein \add is\add* the covenant
of the \nd LORD\nd*, that he made with the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And he stood before the altar of the \nd LORD\nd* in the presence of all the
congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 
\v 13  For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long,
and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the
midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his
knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his
hands toward heaven,\f + \fr 6.13  \ft long…: Heb. the length thereof,
etc\f* 
\v 14  And said, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, \add there is\add*
no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
\add shewest\add* mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their
hearts: 
\v 15  Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast
promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled \add it\add*
with thine hand, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 16  Now therefore, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, keep with thy
servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne
of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk
in my law, as thou hast walked before me.\f + \fr 6.16  \ft There…: Heb. There shall not a man be cut
off\f* 
\v 17  Now then, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. 
\v 18  But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
house which I have built! 
\v 19  Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his
supplication, O \nd LORD\nd* my God, to hearken unto the cry and the
prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee: 
\v 20  That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy
name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth
toward this place.\f + \fr 6.20  \ft toward…: or, in this place\f*
\v 21  Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy
people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy
dwelling place, \add even\add* from heaven; and when thou hearest,
forgive.\f + \fr 6.21  \ft make: Heb. pray\f*\f + \fr 6.21  \ft toward…: or, in this
place\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him
swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;\f + \fr 6.22 
\ft and an oath…: Heb. and he require an oath of him\f* 
\v 23  Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head;
and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess
thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;\f + \fr 6.24 
\ft be put…: or, be smitten\f*\f + \fr 6.24  \ft in: or, toward\f*
\v 25  Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
to them and to their fathers. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
sinned against thee; \add yet\add* if they pray toward this place,
and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict
them;\f + \fr 6.26  \ft toward…: or, in this place\f* 
\v 27  Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,
and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way,
wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast
given unto thy people for an inheritance. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be
blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege
them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness
\add there be:\add*\f + \fr 6.28  \ft in the cities…: Heb. in the land of their

\v 29  \add Then\add* what prayer \add or\add* what supplication
soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every
one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
his hands in this house:\f + \fr 6.29  \ft in: or, toward\f*\f + \fr 6.29 
\ft toward…: or, in this place\f* 
\v 30  Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart
thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of

\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices;
and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* filled the house. 
\v 2  And the priests could not enter into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
because the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* had filled the \nd LORD’s\nd*
house. 
\v 3  And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* upon the house, they bowed themselves with their
faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised
the \nd LORD\nd*, \add saying\add*, For \add he is\add* good; for his
mercy \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before
the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 5  And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the
people dedicated the house of God. 
\v 6  And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
instruments of musick of the \nd LORD\nd*, which David the king had
made to praise the \nd LORD\nd*, because his mercy \add endureth\add*
for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.\f + \fr 7.6  \ft by their…: Heb. by their
hand\f* 
\v 7  Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that \add was\add*
before the house of the \nd LORD\nd*: for there he offered burnt
offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen
altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings,
and the meat offerings, and the fat. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in
of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 
\v 9  And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven
days.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft a solemn…: Heb. a restraint\f* 
\v 10  And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the
goodness that the \nd LORD\nd* had shewed unto David, and to Solomon,
and to Israel his people. 
\v 11  Thus Solomon finished the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the
king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and in his own house, he prosperously
effected. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared  to Solomon by night, and said
unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an
house of sacrifice. 
\v 13  If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command
the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
people; 
\v 14  If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and
pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I
hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their
land.\f + \fr 7.14  \ft which…: Heb. upon whom my name is called\f*

\v 16  For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
perpetually. 
\v 17  And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt
observe my statutes and my judgments; 
\v 18  Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have
covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a

\v 19  But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and
worship them; 
\v 20  Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have
given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name,
will I cast out of my sight, and will make it \add to be\add* a proverb
and a byword among all nations. 
\v 21  And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that
passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the \nd LORD\nd* done
thus unto this land, and unto this house? 
\v 22  And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the \nd LORD\nd*
God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served
them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon
had built the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and his own house, 
\v 2  That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. 
\v 3  And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
\v 4  And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,
which he built in Hamath. 
\v 5  Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether,
fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 
\v 6  And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the
chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon
desired  to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the
land of his dominion.\f + \fr 8.6  \ft all that…: Heb. all the desire of Solomon which he desired to
build\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ \add As for\add* all the people \add that were\add* left of the
Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
and the Jebusites, which \add were\add* not of Israel, 
\v 8  \add But\add* of their children, who were left after them in the
land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
make to pay tribute until this day. 
\v 9  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants
for his work; but they \add were\add* men of war, and chief of his
captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen. 
\v 10 And these \add were\add* the chief of king Solomon’s officers,
\add even\add* two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the
city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said,
My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because
\add the places are\add* holy, whereunto the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*
hath come.\f + \fr 8.11  \ft holy: Heb. holiness\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the \nd LORD\nd*
on the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he had built before the porch,
\v 13  Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn
feasts, three times in the year, \add even\add* in the feast of unleavened
bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their
charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every
day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had
David the man of God commanded.\f + \fr 8.14  \ft so had David…: Heb. so was the commandment of David the man of
God\f* 
\v 15  And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\v 16  Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
foundation of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and until it was finished.
\add So\add* the house of the \nd LORD\nd* was perfected. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea
side in the land of Edom.\f + \fr 8.17  \ft Eloth: also called, Elath\f*
\v 18  And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants
of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents
of gold, and brought \add them\add* to king Solomon. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very
great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance,
and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed
with him of all that was in her heart. 
\v 2  And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
hid from Solomon which he told her not. 
\v 3  And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
and the house that he had built, 
\v 4  And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers
also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*; there was no more spirit in her.\f + \fr 9.4 
\ft cupbearers: or, butlers\f* 
\v 5  And she said to the king, \add It was\add* a true report which I
heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:\f + \fr 9.5 
\ft report: Heb. word\f*\f + \fr 9.5  \ft acts: or, sayings\f* 
\v 6  Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine

of thy wisdom was not told me: \add for\add* thou exceedest the fame
that I heard. 
\v 7  Happy \add are\add* thy men, and happy \add are\add* these thy
servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
\v 8  Blessed be the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, which delighted in thee to
set thee on his throne, \add to be\add* king for the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever,
therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
\v 9  And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such
spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon. 
\v 10  And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.\f + \fr 9.10 
\ft algum…: also called, almug trees\f* 
\v 11  And the king made \add of\add* the algum trees terraces to the

psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the
land of Judah.\f + \fr 9.11  \ft terraces: or, stairs: Heb. highways\f*
\v 12  And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside \add that\add* which she had brought
unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her
servants. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 
\v 14 Beside \add that which\add* chapmen and merchants brought.
And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought
gold and silver to Solomon.\f + \fr 9.14  \ft governors: or, captains\f*
\p
\v 15 ¶ And king Solomon made two hundred targets \add of\add* beaten
gold: six hundred \add shekels\add* of beaten gold went to one target.
\v 16  And three hundred shields \add made he of\add* beaten  gold:
three hundred \add shekels\add* of gold went to one shield. And the
king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
\v 17  Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
it with pure gold. 
\v 18 And \add there were\add* six steps to the throne, with a footstool
of gold, \add which were\add* fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the

\v 19  And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the

\p
\v 20 ¶ And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon \add were of\add*
gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon \add were

\v 21  For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of

gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.\f + \fr 9.21  \ft ivory: or, elephants’

\v 22  And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
and wisdom. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 
\v 24  And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver,
and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
mules, a rate year by year. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities,
and with the king at Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.\f + \fr 9.26

\v 28  And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all

\v 29 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, \add are\add*

of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against
Jeroboam the son of Nebat?\f + \fr 9.29  \ft book: Heb. words\f*
\v 30  And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
\v 31  And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
come to make him king. 
\v 2  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who \add was\add*
in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king,
heard \add it\add*, that Jeroboam returned  out of Egypt. 
\v 3  And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
and spake to Rehoboam, saying, 
\v 4  Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the
grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put
upon us, and we will serve thee. 
\v 5  And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
And the people departed. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel
give ye \add me\add* to return answer to this people? 
\v 7  And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people,
and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants
for ever. 
\v 8  But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took
counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood
before him. 
\v 9  And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the
yoke that thy father did put upon us? 
\v 10  And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him,
saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying,
Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \add it\add* somewhat
lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little \add finger\add*
shall be thicker than my father’s loins. 
\v 11  For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I \add will chastise
you\add* with scorpions.\f + \fr 10.11  \ft my father put: Heb. my father

\p
\v 12  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\v 13  And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
the counsel of the old men, 
\v 14  And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father
chastised  you with whips, but I \add will chastise you\add* with
scorpions. 
\v 15  So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of
God, that the \nd LORD\nd* might perform his word, which he spake
by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And when all Israel \add  saw \add* that the king would not
hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion
have we in David? and \add we have\add* none inheritance in the son
of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: \add and\add* now, David,
see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents. 
\v 17 But \add as for\add* the children of Israel that dwelt in the
cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
\v 18  Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that \add was\add* over the
tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he
died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to \add his\add*
chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.\f + \fr 10.18  \ft made speed: Heb. strengthened

\v 19  And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen
\add men\add*, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might
bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
\v 2  But the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Shemaiah the man of
God, saying, 
\v 3  Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all
Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
\v 4  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Ye shall not go up, nor fight
against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, and
returned from going against Jeroboam. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
in Judah. 
\v 6  He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 
\v 7  And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam, 
\v 8  And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 
\v 9  And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 
\v 10  And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which \add are\add* in
Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities. 
\v 11  And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and
store of victual, and of oil and wine. 
\v 12  And in every several city \add he put\add* shields and spears,
and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And the priests and the Levites that \add were\add* in all
Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.\f + \fr 11.13  \ft resorted…: Heb. presented themselves to

\v 14  For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them
off from executing the priest’s office unto the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 15  And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
devils, and for the calves which he had made. 
\v 16  And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
their hearts to seek the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
to sacrifice unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers. 
\v 17  So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked
in the way of David and Solomon. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
son of David to wife, \add and\add* Abihail the daughter of Eliab
the son of Jesse; 
\v 19  Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
\v 20  And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.\f + \fr 11.20 
\ft Maachah: she is also called Michaiah the daughter of Uriel\f*
\v 21  And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore
concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
\v 22  And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, \add to
be\add* ruler among his brethren: for \add he thought\add* to make him
king. 
\v 23  And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the
countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave
them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.\f + \fr 11.23 
\ft many wives: Heb. a multitude of wives\f* 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,
and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and all Israel with him. 
\v 2 And it came to pass, \add that\add* in the fifth year of king
Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had
transgressed against the \nd LORD\nd*, 
\v 3  With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen:
and the people \add were\add* without number that came with him out of
Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. 
\v 4  And he took the fenced cities which \add pertained\add* to
Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and \add to\add*
the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because
of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Ye have
forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\v 6  Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled  themselves; and they
said, The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* righteous. 
\v 7  And when the \nd LORD\nd* saw that they humbled themselves, the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;
\add therefore\add* I will not destroy them, but I will grant them
some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem
by the hand of Shishak.\f + \fr 12.7  \ft some: or, a little while\f*
\v 8  Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know
my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. 
\v 9  So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
away the treasures of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the treasures
of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields
of gold which Solomon had made. 
\v 10  Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
committed \add them\add* to the hands of the chief of the guard,
that kept the entrance of the king’s house. 
\v 11  And when the king entered into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
guard chamber. 
\v 12  And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the \nd LORD\nd*
turned from him, that he would not destroy \add him\add* altogether:
and also in Judah things went well.\f + \fr 12.12  \ft and also…: or, and yet in Judah there were good
things\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
for Rehoboam \add was\add* one and forty years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the
\nd LORD\nd* had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his
name there. And his mother’s name \add was\add* Naamah an Ammonitess.
\v 14  And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek
the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 12.14  \ft prepared: or, fixed\f* 
\v 15  Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, \add are\add* they not
written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
concerning genealogies? And \add there were\add* wars between Rehoboam
and Jeroboam continually.\f + \fr 12.15  \ft book: Heb. words\f*
\v 16  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.\f + \fr 12.16 
\ft Abijah: also called, Abijam\f* 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
reign over Judah. 
\v 2  He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
\add was\add* Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
\v 3  And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant
men of war, \add even\add* four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam
also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand
chosen men, \add being\add* mighty men of valour.\f + \fr 13.3  \ft Abijah set: Heb. Abijah bound
together\f* 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which \add is\add*
in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
\v 5  Ought ye not to know that the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel gave
the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, \add even\add* to him and to his
sons by a covenant of salt? 
\v 6  Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. 
\v 7  And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,
and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon,
when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand
them. 
\v 8  And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the \nd LORD\nd*
in the hand of the sons of David; and ye \add be\add* a great multitude, and
\add there are\add* with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
gods. 
\v 9  Have ye not cast out the priests of the \nd LORD\nd*, the sons
of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the
nations of \add other\add* lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate
himself with a young bullock and seven rams, \add the same\add* may be a
priest of \add them that are\add* no gods.\f + \fr 13.9  \ft to consecrate…: Heb. to fill his
hand\f* 
\v 10  But as for us, the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* our God, and we have not
forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add are\add* the sons of Aaron, and the Levites \add wait\add* upon
\add their\add* business: 
\v 11  And they burn unto the \nd LORD\nd* every morning and every
evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also \add set they in
order\add* upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the
lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the
\nd LORD\nd* our God; but ye have forsaken him. 
\v 12  And, behold, God himself \add is\add* with us for \add our\add*
captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
children of Israel, fight ye not against the \nd LORD\nd* God of your
fathers; for ye shall not prosper. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were
before Judah, and the ambushment \add was\add* behind them. 
\v 14  And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle \add was\add*
before and behind: and they cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and the
priests sounded with the trumpets. 
\v 15  Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel
before Abijah and Judah. 
\v 16  And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered
them into their hand. 
\v 17  And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter:
so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\v 18  Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the
\nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers. 
\v 19  And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and
Ephrain with the towns thereof. 
\v 20  Neither did Jeroboam recover  strength again in the days of
Abijah: and the \nd LORD\nd* struck him, and he died. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and
begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 
\v 22  And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
sayings, \add are\add* written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days
the land was quiet ten years. 
\v 2  And Asa did \add that which was\add* good and right in the
eyes of the \nd LORD\nd* his God: 
\v 3  For he took away the altars of the strange \add gods\add*,
and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the
groves:\f + \fr 14.3  \ft images: Heb. statues\f* 
\v 4  And commanded Judah to seek the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers,
and to do the law and the commandment. 
\v 5  Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.\f + \fr 14.5 
\ft images: Heb. sun images\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
and he had no war in those years; because the \nd LORD\nd* had given him
rest. 
\v 7  Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
about \add them\add* walls, and towers, gates, and bars, \add while\add*
the land \add is\add* yet before us; because we have sought the \nd LORD\nd*
our God, we have sought \add him\add*, and he hath given us rest
on every side. So they built and prospered. 
\v 8  And Asa had an army \add of men\add* that bare targets and
spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin,
that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these
\add were\add* mighty men of valour. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came
unto Mareshah. 
\v 10  Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
\v 11  And Asa cried unto the \nd LORD\nd* his God, and said, \nd LORD\nd*,
\add it is\add* nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no
power: help us, O \nd LORD\nd* our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy
name we go against this multitude. O \nd LORD\nd*, thou \add art\add*
our God; let not man prevail against thee.\f + \fr 14.11  \ft man: or, mortal
man\f* 
\v 12  So the \nd LORD\nd* smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before
Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 
\v 13  And Asa and the people that \add were\add* with him pursued
them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.\f + \fr 14.13 
\ft destroyed: Heb. broken\f* 
\v 14  And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
of the \nd LORD\nd* came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
for there was exceeding much spoil in them. 
\v 15  They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 
\v 2  And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* with you, while ye be with him; and if ye
seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will
forsake you.\f + \fr 15.2  \ft to meet…: Heb. before Asa\f* 
\v 3  Now for a long season Israel \add hath been\add* without the
true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. 
\v 4  But when they in their trouble did turn unto the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. 
\v 5  And in those times \add there was\add* no peace to him that went
out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations \add were\add*
upon all the inhabitants of the countries. 
\v 6  And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
did vex them with all adversity.\f + \fr 15.6  \ft destroyed: Heb. beaten in
pieces\f* 
\v 7  Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your
work shall be rewarded. 
\p
\v 8  And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the
land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken
from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*, that
\add was\add* before the porch of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 15.8 
\ft abominable…: Heb. abominations\f* 
\v 9  And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of
Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of
Israel in abundance, when they saw that the \nd LORD\nd* his God
\add was\add* with him. 
\v 10  So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 
\v 11  And they offered unto the \nd LORD\nd* the same time, of the
spoil \add which\add* they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven
thousand sheep.\f + \fr 15.11  \ft the same…: Heb. in that day\f*
\v 12  And they entered into a covenant to seek the \nd LORD\nd*
God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
\v 13  That whosoever would not seek the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel
should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\v 14  And they sware unto the \nd LORD\nd* with a loud voice, and with
shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 
\v 15  And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their
heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the
\nd LORD\nd* gave them rest round about. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And also \add concerning\add* Maachah the mother of Asa the
king, he removed her from \add being\add* queen, because she had
made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped \add it\add*,
and burnt \add it\add* at the brook Kidron.\f + \fr 15.16  \ft mother: that is,
grandmother\f*\f + \fr 15.16  \ft idol: Heb. horror\f* 
\v 17  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the
heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And he brought into the house of God the things that his
father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver,
and gold, and vessels. 
\v 19 And there was no \add more\add* war unto the five and thirtieth
year of the reign of Asa. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that
he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
\v 2  Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the \nd LORD\nd* and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad
king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,\f + \fr 16.2  \ft Damascus: Heb.
Darmesek\f* 
\v 3  \add There is\add* a league between me and thee, as \add there
was\add* between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee
silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel,
that he may depart from me. 
\v 4  And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains
of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.\f + \fr 16.4 
\ft his: Heb. which were his\f* 
\v 5  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard \add it\add*, that he left
off building of Ramah, and let his work cease. 
\v 6  Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building;
and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria,
and not relied on the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, therefore is the host
of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand. 
\v 8  Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the \nd LORD\nd*,
he delivered them into thine hand.\f + \fr 16.8  \ft a huge: Heb. in
abundance\f* 
\v 9  For the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd* run to and fro throughout the whole
earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of \add them\add* whose
heart \add is\add* perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.\f + \fr 16.9  \ft to shew…: or, strongly to hold with them,
etc\f* 
\v 10  Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
house; for \add he was\add* in a rage with him because of this \add thing\add*.
And Asa oppressed \add some\add* of the people the same time.\f + \fr 16.10 
\ft oppressed: Heb. crushed\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they \add are\add*
written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
\v 12  And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
in his feet, until his disease \add was\add* exceeding \add great:\add*
yet in his disease he sought not to the \nd LORD\nd*, but to the
physicians. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
year of his reign. 
\v 14  And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was
filled with sweet odours and divers kinds \add of spices\add* prepared
by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for
him.\f + \fr 16.14  \ft had made: Heb. had digged\f* 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
himself against Israel. 
\v 2  And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim,
which Asa his father had taken. 
\v 3  And the \nd LORD\nd* was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked
in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;\f + \fr 17.3 
\ft of…: or, of his father, and of David\f* 
\v 4  But sought to the \add  \+nd Lord\+nd*\add* God of his father,
and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
\v 5  Therefore the \nd LORD\nd* stablished the kingdom in his hand;
and all Judah brought  to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches
and honour in abundance.\f + \fr 17.5  \ft brought: Heb. gave\f*
\v 6  And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the \nd LORD\nd*:
moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.\f + \fr 17.6 
\ft was…: that is, was encouraged\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
\add even\add* to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 
\v 8 And with them \add he sent\add* Levites, \add even\add* Shemaiah,
and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan,
and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them
Elishama and Jehoram, priests. 
\v 9  And they taught in Judah, and \add had\add* the book of the
law of the \nd LORD\nd* with them, and went about throughout all the
cities of Judah, and taught the people. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the fear of the \nd LORD\nd* fell upon all the kingdoms

war against Jehoshaphat.\f + \fr 17.10  \ft fell: Heb. was\f* 
\v 11 Also \add some\add* of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat
presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks,
seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven

\p
\v 12 ¶ And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in
Judah castles, and cities of store.\f + \fr 17.12  \ft castles: or,
palaces\f* 
\v 13  And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
of war, mighty men of valour, \add were\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And these \add are\add* the numbers of them according to the
house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah
the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.
\v 15  And next to him \add was\add* Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
hundred and fourscore thousand.\f + \fr 17.15  \ft next…: Heb. at his

\v 16  And next him \add was\add* Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly

\v 17  And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed
men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. 
\v 18  And next him \add was\add* Jehozabad, and with him an hundred
and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. 
\v 19  These waited on the king, beside \add those\add* whom the
king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
affinity with Ahab. 
\v 2  And after \add certain\add* years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.
And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
people that \add he had\add* with him, and persuaded him to go up
\add with him\add* to Ramoth-gilead.\f + \fr 18.2  \ft after…: Heb. at the end of

\v 3  And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I \add am\add* as thou
\add art\add*, and my people as thy people; and \add we will be\add*
with thee in the war. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the
word of the \nd LORD\nd* to day. 
\v 5  Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead
to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will
deliver \add it\add* into the king’s hand. 
\v 6  But Jehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a prophet
of the \nd LORD\nd* besides, that we might enquire of him?\f + \fr 18.6 
\ft besides: Heb. yet, or, more\f* 
\v 7  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \add There is\add*

\add is\add* Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the

\v 8  And the king of Israel called for one \add of his\add* officers,

\v 9  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either

prophets prophesied before them.\f + \fr 18.9  \ft void…: or, floor\f*
\v 10  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,

\v 12  And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
saying, Behold, the words of the prophets \add declare\add* good

one of theirs, and speak thou good.\f + \fr 18.12  \ft with…: Heb. with one

\v 13  And Micaiah said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, even what my

\v 14  And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?
And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your

\v 15  And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou
say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 16  Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,
as sheep that have no shepherd: and the \nd LORD\nd* said, These have no
master; let them return \add therefore\add* every man to his house
in peace. 
\v 17  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
\add that\add* he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?\f + \fr 18.17 
\ft but evil: or, but for evil\f* 
\v 18  Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*;
I saw the \nd LORD\nd* sitting  upon his throne, and all the host
of heaven standing on his right hand and \add on\add* his left. 
\v 19  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel,
that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying
after this manner, and another saying after that manner. 
\v 20  Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and said, I will entice him. And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Wherewith?
\v 21  And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
of all his prophets. And \add the \+nd Lord\+nd*\add* said, Thou shalt

\add even\add* so. 
\v 22  Now therefore, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath put a lying spirit
in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken
evil against thee. 
\v 23  Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah
upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd*
from me to speak unto thee? 
\v 24  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt
go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.\f + \fr 18.24  \ft into…: or, from chamber to chamber: Heb. a chamber in a

\v 25  Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him

\v 26  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this \add fellow\add* in the
prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction,
until I return in peace. 
\v 27  And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, \add then\add*
hath not the \nd LORD\nd* spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye

\p
\v 28  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
up to Ramoth-gilead. 
\v 29  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the
king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. 
\v 30  Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that
\add were\add* with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great,
save only with the king of Israel. 
\v 31  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat, that they said, It \add is\add* the king of Israel.
Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried
out, and the \nd LORD\nd* helped him; and God moved them \add to

\v 33 And a \add certain\add* man drew a bow at a venture, and smote

\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
peace to Jerusalem. 
\v 2  And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love
them that hate the \nd LORD\nd*? therefore \add is\add* wrath upon thee from
before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 3  Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken
away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to
seek God. 
\v 4  And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the
people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the
\nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers.\f + \fr 19.4  \ft he went…: Heb. he returned and went

\v 5 ¶ And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities

not for man, but for the \nd LORD\nd*, who \add is\add* with you in the

\p
\v 8 ¶ Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
\add of\add* the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel,
for the judgment of the \nd LORD\nd*, and for controversies, when they
returned to Jerusalem. 
\v 9  And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
\nd LORD\nd*, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 
\v 10  And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment,
statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass
not against the \nd LORD\nd*, and \add so\add* wrath come upon you, and upon your

\v 11  And, behold, Amariah the chief priest \add is\add* over you in all

and the \nd LORD\nd* shall be with the good.\f + \fr 19.11  \ft Deal…: Heb. Take courage and

\c 20  
\p
\v 1  It came to pass after this also, \add that\add* the children
of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them \add other\add*
beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 
\v 2  Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they
\add be\add* in Hazazon-tamar, which \add is\add* En-gedi. 
\v 3  And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the \nd LORD\nd*,
and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.\f + \fr 20.3  \ft himself: Heb. his

\v 4  And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask \add help\add*
of the \nd LORD\nd*: even out of all the cities of Judah they came
to seek the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,
in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, before the new court, 
\v 6  And said, O \nd LORD\nd* God of our fathers, \add art\add*
not thou God in heaven? and rulest \add not\add* thou over all the
kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand \add is there not\add*
power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? 
\v 7  \add Art\add* not thou our God, \add who\add* didst drive out
the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest
it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?\f + \fr 20.7  \ft who: Heb.

\v 8  And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy

presence, (for thy name \add is\add* in this house,) and cry unto thee in our
affliction, then thou wilt hear and help. 
\v 10  And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out
of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
\v 11 Behold, \add I say, how\add* they reward us, to come to cast us
out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. 
\v 12  O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we
what to do: but our eyes \add are\add* upon thee. 
\v 13  And all Judah stood before the \nd LORD\nd*, with their little
ones, their wives, and their children. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph,
came the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* in the midst of the congregation;
\v 15  And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*
unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude;
for the battle \add is\add* not yours, but God’s. 
\v 16  To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the

\v 18  And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with \add his\add* face to the
ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before
the \nd LORD\nd*, worshipping the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 19  And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the \nd LORD\nd* God
of Israel with a loud voice on high. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and
said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe
in the \nd LORD\nd* your God, so shall ye be established; believe
his prophets, so shall ye prosper. 
\v 21  And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers
unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and that should praise the beauty of holiness,
as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the \nd LORD\nd*;
for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever.\f + \fr 20.21  \ft that…: Heb.

\p
\v 22 ¶ And when they began to sing and to praise, the \nd LORD\nd*
set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir,
which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.\f + \fr 20.22

\v 23  For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants

\v 24  And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they \add were\add*

\ft none…: Heb. there was not an escaping\f* 
\v 25  And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead
bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more
than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering
of the spoil, it was so much. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
of Berachah; for there they blessed the \nd LORD\nd*: therefore the
name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this
day.\f + \fr 20.26  \ft Berachah: that is, blessing\f* 
\v 27  Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and

\ft forefront: Heb. head\f* 
\v 28  And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets
unto the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 29  And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of \add those\add*
countries, when they had heard that the \nd LORD\nd* fought against the
enemies of Israel. 
\v 30  So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
rest round about. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: \add he was\add* thirty
and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty
and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \add was\add*
Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
\v 32  And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it,
doing \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 33  Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
\v 34  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they
\add are\add* written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who
\add is\add* mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.\f + \fr 20.34

\p
\v 35 ¶ And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 
\v 36  And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish:
and they made the ships in Ezion-geber. 
\v 37  Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,
the \nd LORD\nd* hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken,
that they were not able to go to Tarshish. 
\c 21  
\p
\v 1  Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\v 2  And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,
and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these
\add were\add* the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
\v 3  And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom
gave he to Jehoram; because he \add was\add* the firstborn. 
\v 4  Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father,
he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and
\add divers\add* also of the princes of Israel. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Jehoram \add was\add* thirty and two years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
\v 6  And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he
wrought \add that which was\add* evil in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 7  Howbeit the \nd LORD\nd* would not destroy the house of David,
because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised
to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.\f + \fr 21.7  \ft light: Heb. lamp, or,

\p
\v 8 ¶ In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion
of Judah, and made themselves a king.\f + \fr 21.8  \ft dominion: Heb.

\v 9  Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
in, and the captains of the chariots. 
\v 10  So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
day. The same time \add also\add* did Libnah revolt from under his
hand; because he had forsaken the \nd LORD\nd* God of his fathers.
\v 11  Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the
inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah
\add thereto\add*. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of David thy father, Because thou hast not
walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of
Asa king of Judah, 
\v 13  But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the
whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren
of thy father’s house, \add which were\add* better than thyself:
\v 14  Behold, with a great plague will the \nd LORD\nd* smite thy

\v 15 And thou \add shalt have\add* great sickness by disease of thy

\p
\v 16 ¶ Moreover the \nd LORD\nd* stirred up against Jehoram the
spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that \add were\add*
near the Ethiopians: 
\v 17  And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his
sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save
Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.\f + \fr 21.17  \ft carried…: Heb. carried

\p
\v 18 ¶ And after all this the \nd LORD\nd* smote him in his bowels
with an incurable disease. 
\v 19  And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end
of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he
died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the
burning of his fathers. 
\v 20  Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.
Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres
of the kings.\f + \fr 21.20  \ft without…: Heb. without desire\f*
\c 22  
\p
\v 1  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest
son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians
to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram
king of Judah reigned. 
\v 2  Forty and two years old \add was\add* Ahaziah when he began to
reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
\add was\add* Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
\v 3  He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother
was his counsellor to do wickedly. 
\v 4  Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd* like the
house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
father to his destruction. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram
the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. 
\v 6  And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to
see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.\f + \fr 22.6 
\ft which…: Heb. wherewith they wounded him\f*\f + \fr 22.6  \ft Azariah: also called, Ahaziah, or,

\v 7  And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son
of Nimshi, whom the \nd LORD\nd* had anointed to cut off the house
of Ahab.\f + \fr 22.7  \ft destruction: Heb. treading down\f* 
\v 8  And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons
of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
\v 9  And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid
in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they
buried him: Because, said they, he \add is\add* the son of Jehoshaphat,
who sought the \nd LORD\nd* with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah
had no power to keep still the kingdom. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son
was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
of Judah. 
\v 11  But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the
son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were
slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath,
the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the
sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.\f + \fr 22.11 
\ft Jehoshabeath: also called, Jehosheba\f* 
\v 12  And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
Athaliah reigned over the land. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael
the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the
son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
\v 2  And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the
cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they
came to Jerusalem. 
\v 3  And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall
reign, as the \nd LORD\nd* hath said of the sons of David. 
\v 4 This \add is\add* the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, \add shall
be\add* porters of the doors;\f + \fr 23.4  \ft doors: Heb. thresholds\f*
\v 5  And a third part \add shall be\add* at the king’s house; and a third
part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people \add shall
be\add* in the courts of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  But let none come into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, save the
priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they
\add are\add* holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 7  And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever \add else\add* cometh
into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
when he cometh in, and when he goeth out. 
\v 8  So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come
in on the sabbath, with them that were to go \add out\add* on the
sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. 
\v 9  Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
spears, and bucklers, and shields, that \add had been\add* king David’s, which
\add were\add* in the house of God. 
\v 10  And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple,
along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.\f + \fr 23.10 
\ft side: Heb. shoulder\f*\f + \fr 23.10  \ft temple: Heb. house\f*
\v 11  Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the

Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.\f + \fr 23.11 
\ft God…: Heb. Let the king live\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*:
\v 13  And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar
at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets,
also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing
praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.\f + \fr 23.13 
\ft Treason: Heb. Conspiracy\f* 
\v 14  Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the
ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword.
For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 15  So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering
of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
people, and between the king, that they should be the \nd LORD’s\nd*
people. 
\v 17  Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan
the priest of Baal before the altars. 
\v 18  Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*
by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed
in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, to offer the burnt offerings of the
\nd LORD\nd*, as \add it is\add* written in the law of Moses, with

\v 20  And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought
down the king from the house of the \nd LORD\nd*: and they came through
the high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne
of the kingdom. 
\v 21  And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was

\v 1  Joash \add was\add* seven years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also \add was\add*

\v 2  And Joash did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the

\v 3  And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and

\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to pass after this, \add that\add* Joash was minded
to repair the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 24.4  \ft to repair: Heb. to

\v 5  And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel
money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye
hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened \add it\add* not.
\v 6  And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not
required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem
the collection, \add according to the commandment\add* of Moses the
servant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and of the congregation of Israel, for the
tabernacle of witness? 
\v 7  For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up
the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
of the \nd LORD\nd* did they bestow upon Baalim. 
\v 8  And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it
without at the gate of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring
in to the \nd LORD\nd* the collection \add that\add* Moses the servant

\v 10  And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought

\v 11  Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they
saw that \add there was\add* much money, the king’s scribe and the
high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and
carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered
money in abundance. 
\v 12  And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work
of the service of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hired masons
and carpenters to repair the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and also such as
wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.\f + \fr 24.13

\v 16  And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his
house. 
\v 17  Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah,
and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
\v 18  And they left the house of the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers,
and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem
for this their trespass. 
\v 19  Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
\nd LORD\nd*; and they testified against them: but they would not give
ear. 
\v 20  And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus
saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*,
that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*,
he hath also forsaken you.\f + \fr 24.20  \ft came…: Heb. clothed\f*
\v 21  And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones
at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22  Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he
said, The \nd LORD\nd* look upon \add it\add*, and require \add it\add*.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of the year, \add that\add*
the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the

\v 24  For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
and the \nd LORD\nd* delivered a very great host into their hand,
because they had forsaken the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers.
So they executed judgment against Joash. 
\v 25  And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood
of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he
died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the
sepulchres of the kings. 
\v 26  And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.\f + \fr 24.26

And his mother’s name \add was\add* Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
\v 2  And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, but not with a perfect heart. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he
slew his servants that had killed the king his father.\f + \fr 25.3 
\ft established…: Heb. confirmed upon him\f* 
\v 4  But he slew not their children, but \add did\add* as \add it
is\add* written in the law in the book of Moses, where the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the
children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own
sin. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains
over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of
\add their\add* fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he
numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three
hundred thousand choice \add men, able\add* to go forth to war, that could
handle spear and shield. 
\v 6  He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 
\v 7  But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the
army of Israel go with thee; for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* not with
Israel, \add to wit, with\add* all the children of Ephraim. 
\v 8  But if thou wilt go, do \add it\add*, be strong for the battle:
God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
help, and to cast down. 
\v 9  And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the
man of God answered, The \nd LORD\nd* is able to give thee much more than
this.\f + \fr 25.9  \ft army: Heb. band\f* 
\v 10  Then Amaziah separated them, \add to wit\add*, the army that was

was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great
anger.\f + \fr 25.10  \ft home again: Heb. to their place\f*\f + \fr 25.10

\p
\v 11 ¶ And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir
ten thousand. 
\v 12 And \add other\add* ten thousand \add left\add* alive did the
children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top
of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in
pieces. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not
go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria
even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took
much spoil.\f + \fr 25.13  \ft the soldiers…: Heb. the sons of the

\p
\v 14 ¶ Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children
of Seir, and set them up \add to be\add* his gods, and bowed down
himself before them, and burned incense unto them. 
\v 15  Wherefore the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against
Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou
sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own
people out of thine hand? 
\v 16  And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that \add the
king\add* said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel? forbear;
why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,

\p
\v 17 ¶ Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash,
the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come,
let us see one another in the face. 
\v 18  And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
The thistle that \add was\add* in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
\add was\add* in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to

\v 20  But Amaziah would not hear; for it \add came\add* of God,
that he might deliver them into the hand \add of their enemies\add*,
because they sought after the gods of Edom. 
\v 21  So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another

\v 23  And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the

\p
\v 25 ¶ And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the

\v 26  Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,

\v 27 ¶ Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following

\v 17  And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore

\v 19  Then Uzziah was wroth, and \add had\add* a censer in his hand

\v 12  Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah

offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table,
with all the vessels thereof. 
\v 19  Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they
\add are\add* before the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers
of the city, and went up to the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 21  And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the
sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of
Aaron to offer \add them\add* on the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
blood, and sprinkled \add it\add* on the altar: likewise, when they had
killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed
also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. 
\v 23  And they brought forth the he goats \add for\add* the sin
offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
hands upon them:\f + \fr 29.23  \ft forth: Heb. near\f* 
\v 24  And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation
with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel:
for the king commanded \add that\add* the burnt offering and the sin
offering \add should be made\add* for all Israel. 
\v 25  And he set the Levites in the house of the \nd LORD\nd* with
cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for
\add so was\add* the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* by his prophets.\f + \fr 29.25 
\ft commandment of the \+nd LORD\+nd*: Heb. commandment by the hand of the
\+nd LORD\+nd*\f*\f + \fr 29.25  \ft by: Heb. by the hand of\f* 
\v 26  And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
priests with the trumpets. 
\v 27  And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the \nd LORD\nd*
began \add also\add* with the trumpets, and with the instruments
\add ordained\add* by David king of Israel.\f + \fr 29.27  \ft when: Heb. in the
time\f*\f + \fr 29.27  \ft the instruments: Heb. hands of instruments\f*
\v 28  And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang,
and the trumpeters sounded: \add and\add* all \add this continued\add*
until the burnt offering was finished.\f + \fr 29.28  \ft singers: Heb.
song\f* 
\v 29  And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were
present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.\f + \fr 29.29 
\ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 30  Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded  the
Levites to sing praise unto the \nd LORD\nd* with the words of David,
and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their
heads and worshipped. 
\v 31  Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the
\nd LORD\nd*, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings
into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. And the congregation brought
in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free
heart burnt offerings.\f + \fr 29.31  \ft consecrated…: or, filled your
hand\f* 
\v 32  And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, \add and\add*
two hundred lambs: all these \add were\add* for a burnt offering
to the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 33  And the consecrated things \add were\add* six hundred oxen
and three thousand sheep. 
\v 34  But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay
all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
help them, till the work was ended, and until the \add other\add*
priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites \add were\add*
more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.\f + \fr 29.34 
\ft did help…: Heb. strengthened them\f* 
\v 35  And also the burnt offerings \add were\add* in abundance,
with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for
\add every\add* burnt offering. So the service of the house of the
\nd LORD\nd* was set in order. 
\v 36  And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared
the people: for the thing was \add done\add* suddenly. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1  And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house
of the \nd LORD\nd* at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel. 
\v 2  For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
\v 3  For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people
gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 
\v 4  And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.\f + \fr 30.4 
\ft pleased…: Heb. was right in the eyes of the king\f* 
\v 5  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep
the passover unto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not
done \add it\add* of a long \add time in such sort\add* as it was
written. 
\v 6  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment
of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant
of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.\f + \fr 30.6 
\ft from: Heb. from the hand\f* 
\v 7  And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
trespassed against the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, \add who\add*
therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. 
\v 8  Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers \add were, but\add*
yield yourselves unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and enter into his sanctuary,
which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the \nd LORD\nd* your
God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.\f + \fr 30.8 
\ft be ye…: Heb. harden not your necks\f*\f + \fr 30.8  \ft yield…: Heb. give the
hand\f* 
\v 9  For if ye turn again unto the \nd LORD\nd*, your brethren and your
children \add shall find\add* compassion before them that lead them
captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the \nd LORD\nd*
your God \add is\add* gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
\add his\add* face from you, if ye return unto him. 
\v 10  So the posts passed from city to city through the country
of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to
scorn, and mocked them. 
\v 11  Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 
\v 12  Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to
do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the
feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
\v 14  And they arose and took away the altars that \add were\add*
in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
cast \add them\add* into the brook Kidron. 
\v 15  Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth \add day\add*
of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 16  And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the
law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, \add which they
received\add* of the hand of the Levites.\f + \fr 30.16  \ft their place: Heb. their
standing\f* 
\v 17 For \add there were\add* many in the congregation that were not
sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the
passovers for every one \add that was\add* not clean, to sanctify
\add them\add* unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 18  For a multitude of the people, \add even\add* many of Ephraim,
and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they
eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed
for them, saying, The good \nd LORD\nd* pardon every one 
\v 19  \add That\add* prepareth his heart to seek God, the \nd LORD\nd*
God of his fathers, though \add he be\add* not \add cleansed\add*
according to the purification of the sanctuary. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* hearkened  to Hezekiah, and healed the
people. 
\p
\v 21  And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem
kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
and the Levites and the priests praised the \nd LORD\nd* day by day,
\add singing\add* with loud instruments unto the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 30.21 
\ft present: Heb. found\f*\f + \fr 30.21  \ft loud…: Heb. instruments of
strength\f* 
\v 22  And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
the good knowledge of the \nd LORD\nd*: and they did eat throughout the
feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession
to the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers.\f + \fr 30.22  \ft comfortably…: Heb. to the heart of
all\f* 
\v 23  And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
and they kept \add other\add* seven days with gladness. 
\v 24  For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave
to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great
number of priests sanctified themselves.\f + \fr 30.24  \ft did give: Heb. lifted up, or,
offered\f*\f + \fr 30.24  \ft gave: Heb. lifted up, or, offered\f*
\v 25  And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the
strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in
Judah, rejoiced. 
\v 26  So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
Solomon the son of David king of Israel \add there was\add* not the like in
Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people:
and their voice was heard, and their prayer came \add up\add* to his
holy dwelling place, \add even\add* unto heaven.\f + \fr 30.27  \ft his holy…: Heb. the habitation of his
holiness\f* 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1  Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces,
and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars
out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly
destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every
man to his possession, into their own cities.\f + \fr 31.1  \ft present: Heb.
found\f*\f + \fr 31.1  \ft images: Heb. statues\f*\f + \fr 31.1 
\ft until…: Heb. until to make an end\f* 
\p
\v 2 ¶ And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
Levites after their courses, every man according to his service,
the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings,
to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the
tents of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 3  \add He appointed\add* also the king’s portion of his substance
for the burnt offerings, \add to wit\add*, for the morning and evening
burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new
moons, and for the set feasts, as \add it is\add* written in the
law of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 4  Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be
encouraged in the law of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil,
and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all
\add things\add* brought they in abundantly.\f + \fr 31.5  \ft came…: Heb. brake
forth\f*\f + \fr 31.5  \ft honey: or, dates\f* 
\v 6 And \add concerning\add* the children of Israel and Judah, that
dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the
\nd LORD\nd* their God, and laid \add them\add* by heaps.\f + \fr 31.6 
\ft by heaps: Heb. heaps, heaps\f* 
\v 7  In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
heaps, and finished \add them\add* in the seventh month. 
\v 8  And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
blessed the \nd LORD\nd*, and his people Israel. 
\v 9  Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the
heaps. 
\v 10  And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
him, and said, Since \add the people\add* began to bring the offerings
into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, we have had enough to eat, and have
left plenty: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath blessed his people; and that which is
left \add is\add* this great store. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house
of the \nd LORD\nd*; and they prepared \add them\add*,\f + \fr 31.11 
\ft chambers: or, storehouses\f* 
\v 12  And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
\add things\add* faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite \add was\add*
ruler, and Shimei his brother \add was\add* the next. 
\v 13  And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, \add were\add*

of God.\f + \fr 31.13  \ft under…: Heb. at the hand\f* 
\v 14  And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the

the oblations of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the most holy things. 
\v 15 And next him \add were\add* Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua,
and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in
\add their\add* set office, to give to their brethren by courses,
as well to the great as to the small:\f + \fr 31.15  \ft next…: Heb. at his

\v 17  Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their
charges by their courses; 
\v 18  And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation:
for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:\f + \fr 31.18 
\ft set…: or, trust\f* 
\v 19  Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, \add which were\add*
in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,

males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies
among the Levites. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought \add that which
was\add* good and right and truth before the \nd LORD\nd* his God.
\v 21  And in every work that he began in the service of the house
of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
he did \add it\add* with all his heart, and prospered. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1  After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the
fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.\f + \fr 32.1 
\ft to win…: Heb. to break them up\f* 
\v 2  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was

\v 3  He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
the waters of the fountains which \add were\add* without the city:
and they did help him. 
\v 4  So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land,
saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?\f + \fr 32.4 
\ft ran: Heb. overflowed\f* 
\v 5  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
broken, and raised \add it\add* up to the towers, and another wall
without, and repaired Millo \add in\add* the city of David, and made
darts and shields in abundance.\f + \fr 32.5  \ft darts: or, swords, or,

\v 6  And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake
comfortably to them, saying,\f + \fr 32.6  \ft spake…: Heb. he spoke to their
heart\f* 
\v 7  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that \add is\add* with him: for
\add there be\add* more with us than with him: 
\v 8 With him \add is\add* an arm of flesh; but with us \add is\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the
people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.\f + \fr 32.8 
\ft rested…: Heb. leaned\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
to Jerusalem, (but he \add himself laid siege\add* against Lachish,
and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all
Judah that \add were\add* at Jerusalem, saying,\f + \fr 32.9  \ft power: Heb.

\v 10  Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?\f + \fr 32.10  \ft siege: or, strong
hold\f* 
\v 11  Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to
die by famine and by thirst, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* our God shall
deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
\v 12  Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship
before one altar, and burn incense upon it? 
\v 13  Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of
\add other\add* lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands
any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? 
\v 14 Who \add was there\add* among all the gods of those nations
that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people
out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine
hand? 
\v 15  Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet
believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver
his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your
God deliver you out of mine hand? 
\v 16  And his servants spake yet \add more\add* against the \nd LORD\nd*
God, and against his servant Hezekiah. 
\v 17  He wrote also letters to rail on the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel,
and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of \add other\add*
lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the
God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. 
\v 18  Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the
people of Jerusalem that \add were\add* on the wall, to affright
them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 
\v 19  And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
gods of the people of the earth, \add which were\add* the work of the
hands of man. 
\v 20 And for this \add cause\add* Hezekiah the king, and the prophet
Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty
men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king
of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was
come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels
slew him there with the sword.\f + \fr 32.21  \ft slew…: Heb. made him

\v 22  Thus the \nd LORD\nd* saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
hand of all \add other\add*, and guided them on every side. 
\v 23  And many brought gifts unto the \nd LORD\nd* to Jerusalem,
and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.\f + \fr 32.23  \ft presents: Heb. precious

\p
\v 24 ¶ In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed
unto the \nd LORD\nd*: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.\f + \fr 32.24 
\ft gave…: or, wrought a miracle for him\f* 
\v 25  But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit \add done\add*
unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath
upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
\v 26  Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
heart, \add both\add* he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
wrath of the \nd LORD\nd* came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.\f + \fr 32.26 
\ft pride: Heb. lifting up\f* 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he
made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant
jewels;\f + \fr 32.27  \ft pleasant…: Heb. instruments of desire\f*
\v 28  Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 
\v 29  Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks
and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.
\v 30  This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David.
And Hezekiah prospered  in all his works. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Howbeit in \add the business of\add* the ambassadors of the
princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
\add done\add* in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might
know all \add that was\add* in his heart.\f + \fr 32.31  \ft ambassadors: Heb.

\p
\v 32 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they

\ft goodness: Heb. kindnesses\f* 
\v 33  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the

inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh

\p
\v 1  Manasseh \add was\add* twelve years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 
\v 2  But did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*,
like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the \nd LORD\nd*
had cast out before the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves,
and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.\f + \fr 33.3 
\ft he built…: Heb. he returned and built\f* 
\v 4  Also he built altars in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, whereof the
\nd LORD\nd* had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever. 
\v 5  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments,
and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards:
he wrought much evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to provoke him to
anger. 
\v 7  And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son,
In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the
tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
\v 8  Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out
of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take
heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole
law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. 
\v 9  So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
err, \add and\add* to do worse than the heathen, whom the \nd LORD\nd*
had destroyed before the children of Israel. 
\v 10  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake to Manasseh, and to his people:
but they would not hearken. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* brought upon them the captains
of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the
thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.\f + \fr 33.11 
\ft of the king: Heb. which were the king’s\f*\f + \fr 33.11  \ft fetters: or,

\v 12  And when he was in affliction, he besought the \nd LORD\nd*
his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
\v 13  And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
Then Manasseh knew that the \nd LORD\nd* he \add was\add* God. 
\v 14  Now after this he built a wall without the city of David,
on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in

\add them\add* out of the city. 
\v 16  And he repaired the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*, and sacrificed

\v 17  Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,

\v 21 ¶ Amon \add was\add* two and twenty years old when he began to
reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
\v 22  But he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; 
\v 23  And humbled not himself before the \nd LORD\nd*, as Manasseh
his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.\f + \fr 33.23

\v 24  And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own

\v 1  Josiah \add was\add* eight years old when he began to reign,

\add neither\add* to the right hand, nor to the left. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth
year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places,
and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. 
\v 4  And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
images, that \add were\add* on high above them, he cut down; and the
groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in
pieces, and made dust \add of them\add*, and strowed \add it\add*

\v 5  And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and

\p
\v 8 ¶ Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and
Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the
recorder, to repair the house of the \nd LORD\nd* his God. 
\v 9  And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites
that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim,
and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin;
and they returned to Jerusalem. 
\v 10  And they put \add it\add* in the hand of the workmen that had the
oversight of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and they gave it to the
workmen that wrought in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, to repair
and amend the house:

which the kings of Judah had destroyed.\f + \fr 34.11  \ft to floor: or, to

\v 12  And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them

and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set

skill of instruments of musick. 
\v 13 Also \add they were\add* over the bearers of burdens, and \add were\add*
overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service:
and of the Levites \add there were\add* scribes, and officers, and

\p
\v 14 ¶ And when they brought out the money that was brought into
the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the

delivered the book to Shaphan. 
\v 16  And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the

\v 17  And they have gathered together the money that was found in the

\v 18  Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the

\ft it: Heb. in it\f* 
\v 19  And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the

\v 20  And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a

\v 21  Go, enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* for me, and for them that are

found: for great \add is\add* the wrath of the \nd LORD\nd* that is poured
out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the \nd LORD\nd*,
to do after all that is written in this book. 
\v 22  And Hilkiah, and \add they\add* that the king \add had appointed\add*,
went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem

\p
\v 23 ¶ And she answered them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, 
\v 24  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, \add even\add* all the curses
that are written in the book which they have read before the king
of Judah: 
\v 25  Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works
of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this
place, and shall not be quenched. 
\v 26  And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
\nd LORD\nd*, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel \add concerning\add* the words which thou hast heard;
\v 27  Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the

thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard \add thee\add*
also, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 28  Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the
evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants
of the same. So they brought the king word again. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
Judah and Jerusalem. 
\v 30  And the king went up into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and all the

which are written in this book. 
\v 32  And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin

\v 33  And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that

\p
\v 1  Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the \nd LORD\nd* in Jerusalem:
and they killed the passover on the fourteenth \add day\add* of the
first month. 
\v 2  And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the
service of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, 
\v 3  And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
holy unto the \nd LORD\nd*, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon
the son of David king of Israel did build; \add it shall\add* not
\add be\add* a burden upon \add your\add* shoulders: serve now the

\v 4  And prepare \add yourselves\add* by the houses of your fathers,
after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel,
and according to the writing of Solomon his son. 
\v 5  And stand in the holy \add place\add* according to the divisions

\v 6  So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare

\v 7  And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the
number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these \add were\add*
of the king’s substance.\f + \fr 35.7  \ft gave: Heb. offered\f*
\v 8  And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests,
and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the

\v 9  Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and

and five hundred oxen.\f + \fr 35.9  \ft gave: Heb. offered\f* 
\v 10  So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s
commandment. 
\v 11  And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled \add the
blood\add* from their hands, and the Levites flayed \add them\add*.
\v 12  And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer

Moses. And so \add did they\add* with the oxen. 
\v 13  And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the

\v 14  And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron \add were busied\add*
in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the
Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of
Aaron. 
\v 15  And the singers the sons of Asaph \add were\add* in their
place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters \add waited\add* at every

\v 16  So all the service of the \nd LORD\nd* was prepared the same

\v 18  And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the

Jerusalem.\f + \fr 35.18  \ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 19  In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover

\p
\v 20 ¶ After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and
Josiah went out against him.\f + \fr 35.20  \ft temple: Heb. house\f*
\v 21  But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou

\v 22  Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but

\v 24  His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put

\v 14 ¶ Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed
