\c 1  
\p
\v 1  The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
\add were\add* in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
\v 2  To whom the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came in the days of Josiah
the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\v 3  It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of
Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive
in the fifth month. 
\p
\v 4  Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 5  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest
forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, \add and\add* I ordained
thee a prophet unto the nations.\f + \fr 1.5  \ft ordained: Heb.
gave\f* 
\v 6  Then said I, Ah, Lord \nd GOD\nd*! behold, I cannot speak: for I
\add am\add* a child. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ But the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Say not, I \add am\add*
a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I
command thee thou shalt speak. 
\v 8  Be not afraid of their faces: for I \add am\add* with thee to
deliver thee, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  Then the \nd LORD\nd* put forth his hand, and touched my mouth.
And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy
mouth. 
\v 10  See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw
down, to build, and to plant. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
\v 12  Then said the \nd LORD\nd* unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
hasten my word to perform it. 
\v 13  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me the second time,
saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the
face thereof \add is\add* toward the north.\f + \fr 1.13  \ft toward…: Heb. from the face of the
north\f* 
\v 14  Then the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Out of the north an evil
shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.\f + \fr 1.14 
\ft shall…: Heb. shall be opened\f* 
\v 15  For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
north, saith the \nd LORD\nd*; and they shall come, and they shall
set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem,
and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the
cities of Judah. 
\v 16  And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I
command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee
before them.\f + \fr 1.17  \ft confound: or, break to pieces\f* 
\v 18  For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the
kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests
thereof, and against the people of the land. 
\v 19  And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I
\add am\add* with thee, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, to deliver thee.
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to me, saying, 
\v 2  Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the
\nd LORD\nd*; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love
of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness,
in a land \add that was\add* not sown.\f + \fr 2.2  \ft thee: or, for thy
sake\f* 
\v 3  Israel \add was\add* holiness unto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add*
the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend;
evil shall come upon them, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 4  Hear ye the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, O house of Jacob, and all the
families of the house of Israel: 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, What iniquity have your fathers
found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after
vanity, and are become vain? 
\v 6  Neither said they, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd* that brought us
up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness,
through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought,
and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through,
and where no man dwelt? 
\v 7  And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled
my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.\f + \fr 2.7  \ft a plentiful…: or, the land of
Carmel\f* 
\v 8  The priests said not, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*?
and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed
against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after
\add things that\add* do not profit. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
and with your children’s children will I plead. 
\v 10  For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto
Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.\f + \fr 2.10 
\ft over: or, over to\f* 
\v 11  Hath a nation changed \add their\add* gods, which \add are\add*
yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for \add that
which\add* doth not profit. 
\v 12  Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
be ye very desolate, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken
me the fountain of living waters, \add and\add* hewed them out cisterns,
broken cisterns, that can hold no water. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ \add Is\add* Israel a servant? \add is\add* he a homeborn
\add slave\add*? why is he spoiled?\f + \fr 2.14  \ft spoiled: Heb. become a
spoil?\f* 
\v 15  The young lions roared upon him, \add and\add* yelled, and they
made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.\f + \fr 2.15 
\ft yelled: Heb. gave out their voice\f* 
\v 16  Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy
head.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft have…: or, feed on thy crown\f* 
\v 17  Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
forsaken the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, when he led thee by the way? 
\v 18  And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink
the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria,
to drink the waters of the river? 
\v 19  Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings
shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that \add it is\add* an
evil \add thing\add* and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God, and that my fear \add is\add* not in thee, saith the Lord
\nd GOD\nd* of hosts. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ For of old time I have broken thy yoke, \add and\add* burst
thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every
high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the
harlot.\f + \fr 2.20  \ft transgress: or, serve\f* 
\v 21  Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed:
how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
\v 22  For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap,
\add yet\add* thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*. 
\v 23  How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: \add thou
art\add* a swift dromedary traversing her ways;\f + \fr 2.23  \ft thou art…: or, O swift
dromedary\f* 
\v 24  A wild ass used to the wilderness, \add that\add* snuffeth
up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away?
all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall
find her.\f + \fr 2.24  \ft A wild…: or, O wild ass, etc\f*\f + \fr 2.24 
\ft used: Heb. taught\f*\f + \fr 2.24  \ft her pleasure: Heb. the desire of her
heart\f*\f + \fr 2.24  \ft turn…: or, reverse it?\f* 
\v 25  Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:
but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers,
and after them will I go.\f + \fr 2.25  \ft There…: or, Is the case
desperate?\f* 
\v 26  As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house
of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests,
and their prophets, 
\v 27  Saying to a stock, Thou \add art\add* my father; and to a
stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned \add their\add*
back unto me, and not \add their\add* face: but in the time of their
trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.\f + \fr 2.27  \ft brought…: or, begotten
me\f*\f + \fr 2.27  \ft their back: Heb. the hinder part of the neck\f*
\v 28 But where \add are\add* thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them
arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for \add according
to\add* the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.\f + \fr 2.28 
\ft trouble: Heb. evil\f* 
\p
\v 29  Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed
against me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 30  In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction:
your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\p
\v 31 ¶ O generation, see ye the word of the \nd LORD\nd*. Have I been a
wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people,
We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?\f + \fr 2.31  \ft We are…: Heb. We have
dominion\f* 
\v 32  Can a maid forget her ornaments, \add or\add* a bride her
attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. 
\v 33  Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also
taught the wicked ones thy ways. 
\v 34  Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the
poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all
these.\f + \fr 2.34  \ft secret…: Heb. digging\f* 
\v 35  Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall
turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest,
I have not sinned. 
\v 36  Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be
ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 
\v 37  Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine
head: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not
prosper in them. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become
another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land
be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers;
yet return again to me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 3.1  \ft They say: Heb.
Saying\f* 
\v 2  Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been
lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the
wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy
wickedness. 
\v 3  Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter
rain; and thou hadst a whore’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
\v 4  Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou \add art\add*
the guide of my youth? 
\v 5  Will he reserve \add his anger\add* for ever? will he keep
\add it\add* to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things
as thou couldest. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ The \nd LORD\nd* said also unto me in the days of Josiah the
king, Hast thou seen \add that\add* which backsliding Israel hath
done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green
tree, and there hath played the harlot. 
\v 7  And I said after she had done all these \add things\add*, Turn
thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah
saw \add it\add*. 
\v 8  And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce;
yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the
harlot also. 
\v 9  And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom,
that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with
stocks.\f + \fr 3.9  \ft lightness: or, fame\f* 
\v 10  And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not
turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 3.10 
\ft feignedly: Heb. in falsehood\f* 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, The backsliding Israel
hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
thou backsliding Israel, saith the \nd LORD\nd*; \add and\add* I will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you: for I \add am\add* merciful, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add and\add* I will not keep \add anger\add* for ever. 
\v 13  Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
against the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the
strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 14  Turn, O backsliding children, saith the \nd LORD\nd*; for I am
married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a
family, and I will bring you to Zion: 
\v 15  And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall
feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
\v 16  And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased
in the land, in those days, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, they shall say
no more, The ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*: neither shall it
come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they
visit \add it;\add* neither shall \add that\add* be done any more.\f + \fr 3.16 
\ft come to mind: Heb. come upon the heart\f*\f + \fr 3.16  \ft that…: or, it be
magnified\f* 
\v 17  At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the \nd LORD\nd*;
and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the
\nd LORD\nd*, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after
the imagination of their evil heart.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft imagination: or,
stubbornness\f* 
\v 18  In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house
of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north
to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.\f + \fr 3.18 
\ft with: or, to\f*\f + \fr 3.18  \ft given…: or, caused your fathers to
possess\f* 
\v 19  But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give
thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations?
and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away
from me.\f + \fr 3.19  \ft from me: Heb. from after me\f*\f + \fr 3.19 
\ft a goodly…: Heb. an heritage of glory, or, beauty\f*\f + \fr 3.19 
\ft pleasant…: Heb. land of desire\f* 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Surely \add as\add* a wife treacherously departeth from her
husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 3.20  \ft husband: Heb. friend\f*
\v 21  A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping \add and\add*
supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted
their way, \add and\add* they have forgotten the \nd LORD\nd* their
God. 
\v 22  Return, ye backsliding children, \add and\add* I will heal
your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou \add art\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* our God. 
\v 23  Truly in vain \add is salvation hoped for\add* from the hills,
\add and from\add* the multitude of mountains: truly in the \nd LORD\nd*
our God \add is\add* the salvation of Israel. 
\v 24  For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our
youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\v 25  We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have
sinned against the \nd LORD\nd* our God, we and our fathers, from our
youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*
our God. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, return
unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight,
then shalt thou not remove. 
\v 2  And thou shalt swear, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth, in truth, in
judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they
glory. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. 
\v 4  Circumcise yourselves to the \nd LORD\nd*, and take away the
foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench
\add it\add*, because of the evil of your doings. 
\p
\v 5  Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow
ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble
yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. 
\v 6  Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.\f + \fr 4.6 
\ft retire: or, strengthen\f*\f + \fr 4.6  \ft destruction: Heb.
breaking\f* 
\v 7  The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy
land desolate; \add and\add* thy cities shall be laid waste, without an
inhabitant. 
\v 8  For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the
fierce anger of the \nd LORD\nd* is not turned back from us. 
\v 9  And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add that\add* the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart
of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets
shall wonder. 
\v 10  Then said I, Ah, Lord \nd GOD\nd*! surely thou hast greatly
deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace;
whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. 
\v 11  At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter
of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, 
\v 12  \add Even\add* a full wind from those \add places\add* shall
come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.\f + \fr 4.12 
\ft a full…: or, a fuller wind than those\f*\f + \fr 4.12  \ft give…: Heb. utter
judgments\f* 
\v 13  Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots \add shall
be\add* as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are
spoiled. 
\v 14  O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be
saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? 
\v 15  For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction
from mount Ephraim. 
\v 16  Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,
\add that\add* watchers come from a far country, and give out their
voice against the cities of Judah. 
\v 17  As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been
rebellious against me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 18  Thy way and thy doings have procured these \add things\add* unto thee; this
\add is\add* thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth
unto thine heart. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard,
O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.\f + \fr 4.19 
\ft my very…: Heb. the walls of my heart\f* 
\v 20  Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land
is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, \add and\add* my curtains
in a moment. 
\v 21  How long shall I see the standard, \add and\add* hear the
sound of the trumpet? 
\v 22  For my people \add is\add* foolish, they have not known me; they
\add are\add* sottish children, and they have none understanding: they
\add are\add* wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\v 23  I beheld the earth, and, lo, \add it was\add* without form,
and void; and the heavens, and they \add had\add* no light. 
\v 24  I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the
hills moved lightly. 
\v 25  I beheld, and, lo, \add there was\add* no man, and all the
birds of the heavens were fled. 
\v 26  I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place \add was\add* a wilderness,
and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the
\nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* by his fierce anger. 
\v 27  For thus hath the \nd LORD\nd* said, The whole land shall be
desolate; yet will I not make a full end. 
\v 28  For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black:
because I have spoken \add it\add*, I have purposed \add it\add*,
and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it. 
\v 29  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:
every city \add shall be\add* forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
\v 30 And \add when\add* thou \add art\add* spoiled, what wilt thou
do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest
thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting,
in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; \add thy\add* lovers will despise
thee, they will seek thy life.\f + \fr 4.30  \ft face: Heb. eyes\f*
\v 31  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, \add and\add*
the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice
of the daughter of Zion, \add that\add* bewaileth herself, \add that\add*
spreadeth her hands, \add saying\add*, Woe \add is\add* me now! for my
soul is wearied because of murderers. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see
now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find
a man, if there be \add any\add* that executeth judgment, that seeketh
the truth; and I will pardon it. 
\v 2  And though they say, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth; surely they swear
falsely. 
\v 3  O \nd LORD\nd*, \add are\add* not thine eyes upon the truth?
thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them,
\add but\add* they have refused to receive correction: they have made their
faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. 
\v 4  Therefore I said, Surely these \add are\add* poor; they are
foolish: for they know not the way of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add nor\add*
the judgment of their God. 
\v 5  I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have
known the way of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* the judgment of their
God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, \add and\add* burst
the bonds. 
\v 6  Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, \add and\add*
a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their
cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces:
because their transgressions are many, \add and\add* their backslidings
are increased.\f + \fr 5.6  \ft evenings: or, deserts\f*\f + \fr 5.6 
\ft are increased: Heb. are strong\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken
me, and sworn by \add them that are\add* no gods: when I had fed them to the
full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops
in the harlots’ houses. 
\v 8 They were \add as\add* fed horses in the morning: every one
neighed after his neighbour’s wife. 
\v 9  Shall I not visit for these \add things\add*? saith the \nd LORD\nd*:
and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full
end: take away her battlements; for they \add are\add* not the \nd LORD’s\nd*.
\v 11  For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt
very treacherously against me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 12  They have belied the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, \add It is\add*
not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword
nor famine: 
\v 13  And the prophets shall become wind, and the word \add is\add*
not in them: thus shall it be done unto them. 
\v 14  Wherefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of hosts, Because ye
speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire,
and this people wood, and it shall devour them. 
\v 15  Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*: it \add is\add* a mighty nation, it \add is\add*
an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither
understandest what they say. 
\v 16  Their quiver \add is\add* as an open sepulchre, they \add are\add*
all mighty men. 
\v 17  And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, \add which\add*
thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks
and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall
impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
\v 18  Nevertheless in those days, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I will not
make a full end with you. 
\p

behold, their ear \add is\add* uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
behold, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* is unto them a reproach; they have no

\v 11  Therefore I am full of the fury of the \nd LORD\nd*; I am
weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad,

\v 12  And their houses shall be turned unto others, \add with their\add*

\v 16  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Stand ye in the ways, and see,

therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not
walk \add therein\add*. 
\v 17  Also I set watchmen over you, \add saying\add*, Hearken to the

\v 19  Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,

\v 20  To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the

\v 21  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will lay

\v 12  But go ye now unto my place which \add was\add* in Shiloh,
where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the

\v 13  And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,

\v 18  The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,

called by my name, to pollute it. 
\v 31  And they have built the high places of Tophet, which \add is\add*

\p
\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came also unto me, saying,

\v 5  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Enter not into the house of

\v 8  Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to

\v 9  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel;
Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your
days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people
all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the

our iniquity? or what \add is\add* our sin that we have committed
against the \nd LORD\nd* our God? 
\v 11  Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken
me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and have walked after other gods, and have
served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not
kept my law; 
\v 12  And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye

\v 13  Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye

\p
\v 14 ¶ Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
that it shall no more be said, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth, that brought
up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
\v 15  But, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth, that brought up the children
of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had
driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave
unto their fathers.

\v 16 ¶ Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,

\v 17  For mine eyes \add are\add* upon all their ways: they are not

\v 18  And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance
with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things. 
\v 19  O \nd LORD\nd*, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge
in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the

\v 22  Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I
commanded your fathers. 
\v 23  But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their
neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.

of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. 
\v 26  And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places
about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain,
and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings,

\v 27  But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem
on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall

\v 1  The word which came to Jeremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
\v 2  Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to

\p
\v 11 ¶ Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, I
frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every

\v 12  And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own
devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
\v 13  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Ask ye now among the

and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their

\v 8  And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that

and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them. 
\p
\v 10  Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that

Even so will I break this people and this city, as \add one\add*

\v 14  Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the \nd LORD\nd* had

and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no
wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow,
neither shed innocent blood in this place. 
\v 4  For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the
gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding
in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.\f + \fr 22.4

\v 5  But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith

\v 6  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou
\add art\add* Gilead unto me, \add and\add* the head of Lebanon:
\add yet\add* surely I will make thee a wilderness, \add and\add*
cities \add which\add* are not inhabited. 
\v 7  And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his

into the fire. 
\v 8  And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* done
thus unto this great city? 
\v 9  Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant
of the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: \add but\add*
weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor
see his native country. 
\v 11  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* touching Shallum the son of
Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father,
which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
\v 12  But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive,
and shall see this land no more. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
and his chambers by wrong; \add that\add* useth his neighbour’s service
without wages, and giveth him not for his work; 
\v 14  That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers,

\add and\add* then \add it was\add* well with him? 
\v 16  He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then \add it was\add*
well \add with him: was\add* not this to know me? saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 17  But thine eyes and thine heart \add are\add* not but for thy
covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression,
and for violence, to do \add it\add*.\f + \fr 22.17  \ft violence: or,

\v 18  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* concerning Jehoiakim
the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, \add saying\add*,
Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, \add saying\add*,
Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! 
\v 19  He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast
forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

and into the hand \add of them\add* whose face thou fearest, even into the
hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the
Chaldeans. 
\v 26  And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into

\v 27  But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not
return.\f + \fr 22.27  \ft desire: Heb. lift up their mind\f* 
\v 28  \add Is\add* this man Coniah a despised broken idol? \add is

\v 29  O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 30  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Write ye this man childless,
a man \add that\add* shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his
seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling
any more in Judah. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep
of my pasture! saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 2  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel against the
pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them
away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the
evil of your doings, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 3  And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds;
and they shall be fruitful and increase. 
\v 4  And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall
fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that I will
raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. 
\v 6  In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this
\add is\add* his name whereby he shall be called, THE \nd LORD\nd* OUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS.\f + \fr 23.6  \ft THE \+nd LORD\+nd*…: Heb. Jehovah-tsidkenu\f*
\v 7  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that they shall no more
say, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth, which brought up the children of Israel
out of the land of Egypt; 
\v 8  But, The \nd LORD\nd* liveth, which brought up and which led
the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own
land. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath
overcome, because of the \nd LORD\nd*, and because of the words of his
holiness. 
\v 10  For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing
the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried

\v 11  For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house
have I found their wickedness, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 12  Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery \add ways\add*
in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will
bring evil upon them, \add even\add* the year of their visitation,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied
in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.\f + \fr 23.13  \ft folly: or, an absurd thing: Heb.
unsavoury\f* 
\v 14  I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible
thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the
hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as
Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.\f + \fr 23.14  \ft an…: or,

\v 15  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts concerning the

\v 16  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, Hearken not unto the

they speak a vision of their own heart, \add and\add* not out of the
mouth of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 17  They say still unto them that despise me, The \nd LORD\nd*
hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that
walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon
you.\f + \fr 23.17  \ft imagination: or, stubbornness\f* 
\v 18  For who hath stood in the counsel of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hath
perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard
\add it\add*?\f + \fr 23.18  \ft counsel: or, secret\f* 
\v 19  Behold, a whirlwind of the \nd LORD\nd* is gone forth in fury,

of the wicked. 
\v 20  The anger of the \nd LORD\nd* shall not return, until he have
executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the
latter days ye shall consider it perfectly. 
\v 21  I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
to them, yet they prophesied. 
\v 22  But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people
to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil
way, and from the evil of their doings. 
\v 23  \add Am\add* I a God at hand, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and not a
God afar off? 
\v 24  Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see
him? saith the \nd LORD\nd*. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith
the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 25  I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. 
\v 26 How long shall \add this\add* be in the heart of the prophets
that prophesy lies? yea, \add they are\add* prophets of the deceit
of their own heart; 
\v 27  Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers
have forgotten my name for Baal. 
\v 28  The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my
word, let him speak my word faithfully. What \add is\add* the chaff
to the wheat? saith the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 23.28  \ft that hath a dream: Heb. with whom is,
etc\f* 
\v 29  \add Is\add* not my word like as a fire? saith the \nd LORD\nd*;
and like a hammer \add that\add* breaketh the rock in pieces? 
\v 30 Therefore, behold, I \add am\add* against the prophets, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
\v 31 Behold, I \add am\add* against the prophets, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
that use their tongues, and say, He saith.\f + \fr 23.31  \ft that…: or, that smooth their
tongues\f* 
\v 32 Behold, I \add am\add* against them that prophesy false dreams,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and do tell them, and cause my people to
err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor
commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall
ask thee, saying, What \add is\add* the burden of the \nd LORD\nd*?
thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 34 And \add as for\add* the prophet, and the priest, and the people,
that shall say, The burden of the \nd LORD\nd*, I will even punish
that man and his house.\f + \fr 23.34  \ft punish: Heb. visit upon\f*
\v 35  Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one
to his brother, What hath the \nd LORD\nd* answered? and, What hath the

\v 36  And the burden of the \nd LORD\nd* shall ye mention no more: for every
man’s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the
living God, of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts our God. 
\v 37  Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the \nd LORD\nd*
answered thee? and, What hath the \nd LORD\nd* spoken? 
\v 38  But since ye say, The burden of the \nd LORD\nd*; therefore thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Because ye say this word, The burden of the
\nd LORD\nd*, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say,
The burden of the \nd LORD\nd*; 
\v 39  Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will
forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, \add and cast
you\add* out of my presence: 
\v 40  And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual
shame, which shall not be forgotten. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1  The \nd LORD\nd* shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs
\add were\add* set before the temple of the \nd LORD\nd*, after that
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah
the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the
carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
\v 2  One basket \add had\add* very good figs, \add even\add* like the
figs \add that are\add* first ripe: and the other basket \add had\add*
very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.\f + \fr 24.2 
\ft they…: Heb. for badness\f* 
\v 3  Then said the \nd LORD\nd* unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah?
And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil,
that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ Again the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 5  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel; Like these
good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive
of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the
Chaldeans for \add their\add* good.\f + \fr 24.5  \ft them…: Heb. the

\v 6  For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them
again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull \add them\add*
down; and I will plant them, and not pluck \add them\add* up. 
\v 7  And I will give them an heart to know me, that I \add am\add*
the \nd LORD\nd*: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
surely thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, So will I give Zedekiah the king
of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain
in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 
\v 9  And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms
of the earth for \add their\add* hurt, \add to be\add* a reproach
and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall
drive them.\f + \fr 24.9  \ft to be removed: Heb. for removing, or,

\v 10  And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their
fathers. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of
Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that
\add was\add* the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 
\v 2  The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of
Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
\v 3  From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of
Judah, even unto this day, that \add is\add* the three and twentieth
year, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* hath come unto me, and I have
spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent unto you all his servants the
prophets, rising early and sending \add them;\add* but ye have not
hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. 
\v 5  They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the
evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the \nd LORD\nd*
hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 
\v 6  And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to
anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. 
\v 7  Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*;
that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own
hurt. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; Because ye have not
heard my words, 
\v 9  Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants
thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly
destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and
perpetual desolations. 
\v 10  Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the
voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the

\v 12 ¶ And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,
\add that\add* I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation,

\v 14  For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will

\v 28  And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand

\v 29  For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called

\p
\v 1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah came this word from the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Stand in the court of the \nd LORD’s\nd*
house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship
in the \nd LORD’s\nd* house, all the words that I command thee to

\v 3  If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil
way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them
because of the evil of their doings. 
\v 4  And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*;
If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set

\v 5  To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I

but ye have not hearkened; 
\v 6  Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this

\p
\v 7  So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
speaking these words in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
all that the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded \add him\add* to speak unto all the

\v 9  Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate
without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah
in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came

\v 13  Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the

\p
\v 16 ¶ Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests
and to the prophets; This man \add is\add* not worthy to die: for he hath
spoken to us in the name of the \nd LORD\nd* our God. 
\v 17  Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake
to all the assembly of the people, saying, 
\v 18  Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king
of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith
the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; Zion shall be plowed \add like\add* a
field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the
house as the high places of a forest. 
\v 19  Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
death? did he not fear the \nd LORD\nd*, and besought the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the \nd LORD\nd* repented him of the evil which he had pronounced
against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.\f + \fr 26.19

\v 20  And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
\nd LORD\nd*, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied
against this city and against this land according to all the words
of Jeremiah: 
\v 21  And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the
princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when
Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 
\v 22  And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, \add namely\add*,
Elnathan the son of Achbor, and \add certain\add* men with him into
Egypt. 
\v 23  And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto
Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead
body into the graves of the common people.\f + \fr 26.23  \ft common…: Heb. sons of the

\v 24  Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people
to put him to death. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*,
saying, 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* to me; Make thee bonds and yokes,
and put them upon thy neck,\f + \fr 27.2  \ft saith…: or, hath the

\v 3  And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the
king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem
unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 
\v 4  And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the

\v 5  I have made the earth, the man and the beast that \add are\add*
upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have
given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me. 
\v 6  And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I
given him also to serve him. 
\v 7  And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s
son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations
and great kings shall serve themselves of him. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the nation and kingdom
which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
that nation will I punish, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, with the sword,
and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed
them by his hand. 
\v 9  Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,
nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers,
which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:\f + \fr 27.9 
\ft dreamers: Heb. dreams\f* 
\v 10  For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your

\v 11  But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the
king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own
land, saith the \nd LORD\nd*; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\p
\v 12 ¶ I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
and serve him and his people, and live. 
\v 13  Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence, as the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken against the
nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
\v 14  Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that
speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they
prophesy a lie unto you. 
\v 15  For I have not sent them, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, yet they
prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might
perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.\f + \fr 27.15 
\ft a lie: Heb. in a lie, or, lyingly\f* 
\v 16  Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying,
Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Hearken not to the words of your prophets
that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the \nd LORD’s\nd*
house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy
a lie unto you. 
\v 17  Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
wherefore should this city be laid waste? 
\v 18 But if they \add be\add* prophets, and if the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
be with them, let them now make intercession to the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and
\add in\add* the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go
not to Babylon. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts concerning the pillars,
and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the
residue of the vessels that remain in this city, 
\v 20  Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away
captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem
to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
\v 21  Yea, thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel,
concerning the vessels that remain \add in\add* the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*, and \add in\add* the house of the king of Judah and of
Jerusalem; 
\v 22  They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the
day that I visit them, saith the \nd LORD\nd*; then will I bring
them up, and restore them to this place. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the
reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, \add and\add*
in the fifth month, \add that\add* Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which
\add was\add* of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying, 
\v 2  Thus speaketh the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel,
saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
\v 3  Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the
vessels of the \nd LORD’s\nd* house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:\f + \fr 28.3

saith the \nd LORD\nd*: for I will break the yoke of the king of
Babylon.\f + \fr 28.4  \ft captives: Heb. captivity\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the
presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that
stood in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, 
\v 6  Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the \nd LORD\nd* do so: the
\nd LORD\nd* perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring
again the vessels of the \nd LORD’s\nd* house, and all that is carried away
captive, from Babylon into this place. 
\v 7  Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine
ears, and in the ears of all the people; 
\v 8  The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old
prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms,
of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
\v 9  The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
prophet shall come to pass, \add  then\add* shall the prophet be
known, that the \nd LORD\nd* hath truly sent him. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it. 
\v 11  And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two
full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto Jeremiah \add the
prophet\add*, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke
from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 13  Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*;
Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them
yokes of iron. 
\v 14  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel;
I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may
serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have
given him the beasts of the field also. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,
Hear now, Hananiah; The \nd LORD\nd* hath not sent thee; but thou makest this
people to trust in a lie. 
\v 16  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, I will cast
thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast
taught rebellion against the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 28.16  \ft rebellion: Heb.

\v 17  So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh

\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the words of the letter that Jeremiah
the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away
captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the
people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem
to Babylon; 
\v 2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs,
the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths,
were departed from Jerusalem;)\f + \fr 29.2  \ft eunuchs: or, chamberlains\f*
\v 3  By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the
son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, 
\v 4  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away
captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto
Babylon; 
\v 5  Build ye houses, and dwell \add in them;\add* and plant gardens,

for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may
bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not
diminished. 
\v 7  And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away
captives, and pray unto the \nd LORD\nd* for it: for in the peace
thereof shall ye have peace. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel;
Let not your prophets and your diviners, that \add be\add* in the

\p
\v 10 ¶ For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, That after seventy years

\v 11  For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the

\v 12  Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will

\v 14  And I will be found of you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: and I will turn

and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*;
and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away
captive. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Because ye have said, The \nd LORD\nd* hath raised us up

\v 16  \add Know\add* that thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of the king
that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that

\v 17  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; Behold, I will send
upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make
them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 
\v 18  And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine,
and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the

\p
\v 20 ¶ Hear ye therefore the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, all ye of the

\v 21  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, of
Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which
prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the
hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your

\v 22  And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity
of Judah which \add are\add* in Babylon, saying, The \nd LORD\nd*
make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted
in the fire; 
\v 23  Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed
adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words
in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and \add am\add*

for every man \add that is\add* mad, and maketh himself a prophet,
that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. 
\v 27  Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,

\v 23  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall
use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring
again their captivity; The \nd LORD\nd* bless thee, O habitation
of justice, \add and\add* mountain of holiness. 
\v 24  And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
thereof together, husbandmen, and they \add that\add* go forth with
flocks. 
\v 25  For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished
every sorrowful soul. 
\v 26  Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
\p
\v 27 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that I will
sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man,
and with the seed of beast. 
\v 28 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* like as I have watched
over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to
destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to
plant, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 29  In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten
a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge. 
\v 30  But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that I will
make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house
of Judah: 
\v 32  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
in the day \add that\add* I took them by the hand to bring them out
of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an
husband unto them, saith the \nd LORD\nd*:\f + \fr 31.32  \ft although…: or, should I have continued an husband unto
them?\f* 
\v 33 But this \add shall be\add* the covenant that I will make with the
house of Israel; After those days, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I will
put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their
God, and they shall be my people. 
\v 34  And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every
man his brother, saying, Know the \nd LORD\nd*: for they shall all
know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
their sin no more. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, which giveth the sun for a light
by day, \add and\add* the ordinances of the moon and of the stars
for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof
roar; The \nd LORD\nd* of hosts \add is\add* his name: 
\v 36  If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add then\add* the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
before me for ever. 
\v 37  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; If heaven above can be measured,
and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast
off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 38 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that the city
shall be built to the \nd LORD\nd* from the tower of Hananeel unto the
gate of the corner. 
\v 39  And the measuring line  shall yet go forth over against it upon the
hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. 
\v 40  And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes,
and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the
horse gate toward the east, \add shall be\add* holy unto the \nd LORD\nd*;
it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd LORD\nd* in the
tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which \add was\add* the eighteenth
year of Nebuchadrezzar. 
\v 2  For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and
Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which
\add was\add* in the king of Judah’s house. 
\v 3  For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou
prophesy, and say, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will give
this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\v 4  And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand
of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the
king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his
eyes shall behold his eyes; 
\v 5  And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I
visit him, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: though ye fight with the Chaldeans,
ye shall not prosper. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Jeremiah said, The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me,
saying, 
\v 7  Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come
unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that \add is\add* in Anathoth:
for the right of redemption \add is\add* thine to buy \add it\add*.
\v 8  So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the
prison according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, and said unto me,
Buy my field, I pray thee, that \add is\add* in Anathoth, which \add is\add*
in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance \add is\add*
thine, and the redemption \add is\add* thine; buy \add it\add* for thyself. Then I
knew that this \add was\add* the word of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that \add was\add*
in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, \add even\add* seventeen
shekels of silver.\f + \fr 32.9  \ft seventeen…: or, seven shekels and ten pieces of
silver\f* 
\v 10  And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed \add it\add*, and
took witnesses, and weighed \add him\add* the money in the balances.\f + \fr 32.10 
\ft subscribed…: Heb. wrote in the book\f* 
\v 11  So I took the evidence of the purchase, \add both\add* that which was
sealed \add according\add* to the law and custom, and that which was
open: 
\v 12  And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son
of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s
\add son\add*, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed
the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court
of the prison. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
\v 14  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; Take
these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed,
and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel,
that they may continue many days. 
\v 15  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel;
Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this
land. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
\v 17  Ah Lord \nd GOD\nd*! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the
earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, \add and\add* there is
nothing too hard for thee:\f + \fr 32.17  \ft too…: or, hid from

his name, 
\v 19  Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes \add are\add*

\v 21  And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of
Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched
out arm, and with great terror; 
\v 22  And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their
fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
\v 23  And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy
voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou
commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil
to come upon them: 
\v 24  Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the
city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it,
because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast

\v 25  And thou hast said unto me, O Lord \nd GOD\nd*, Buy thee the

\p
\v 26 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Jeremiah, saying,
\v 27 Behold, I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of all flesh:
is there any thing too hard for me? 
\v 28  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, I will give
this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon, and he shall take it: 
\v 29  And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come
and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose
roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings
unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
\v 30  For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel
have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith
 the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 31  For this city hath been to me \add as\add* a provocation of mine
anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this
day; that I should remove it from before my face,\f + \fr 32.31 
\ft a provocation…: Heb. for my anger\f* 
\v 32  Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their
kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the
men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 33  And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I
taught them, rising up early and teaching \add them\add*, yet they have not
hearkened to receive instruction.\f + \fr 32.33  \ft back: Heb. neck\f*
\v 34  But they set their abominations in the house, which is called
by my name, to defile it. 
\v 35  And they built the high places of Baal, which \add are\add*
in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
daughters to pass through \add the fire\add* unto Molech; which I
commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should
do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And now therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of
Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered
into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine,
and by the pestilence; 
\v 37  Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have
driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them
again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: 
\v 38  And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 
\v 39  And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may
fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after
them:\f + \fr 32.39  \ft for ever: Heb. all days\f* 
\v 40  And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me.\f + \fr 32.40  \ft from them: Heb. from after
them\f* 
\v 41  Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole
soul.\f + \fr 32.41  \ft assuredly: Heb. in truth, or, stability\f*
\v 42  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Like as I have brought all this
great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good
that I have promised them. 
\v 43  And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, \add It
is\add* desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand
of the Chaldeans. 
\v 44  Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
seal \add them\add*, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin,
and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the
cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the
cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1  Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto Jeremiah the
second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
saying, 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* the maker thereof, the \nd LORD\nd*
that formed it, to establish it; the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* his
name;\f + \fr 33.2  \ft the \+nd LORD\+nd* is: or, \+nd JEHOVAH\+nd*,

\v 3  Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not.\f + \fr 33.3  \ft mighty: or, hidden\f*
\v 4  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, concerning the
houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah,
which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 
\v 5  They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but \add it is\add*
to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine
anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my
face from this city. 
\v 6  Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will
reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
\v 7  And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 
\v 8  And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have
sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have
sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good
that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the
goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it. 
\p
\v 10  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Again there shall be heard in this
place, which ye say \add shall be\add* desolate without man and without
beast, \add even\add* in the cities of Judah, and in the streets
of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant,
and without beast, 
\v 11  The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall
say, Praise the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts: for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add*
good; for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever: \add and\add* of them that shall
bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first,
saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 12  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts; Again in this place,
which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities
thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing \add their\add*
flocks to lie down. 
\v 13  In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale,
and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places
about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass
again under the hands of him that telleth \add them\add*, saith the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 14  Behold, the days come, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that I will
perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel
and to the house of Judah. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch
of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment
and righteousness in the land. 
\v 16  In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
safely: and this \add is the name\add* wherewith she shall be called,
The \nd LORD\nd* our righteousness.\f + \fr 33.16  \ft The \+nd LORD\+nd*…: Heb.

\ft David…: Heb. There shall not be cut off from David\f* 
\v 18  Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to
offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice
continually. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto Jeremiah, saying,
\v 20  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; If ye can break my covenant of the
day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day
and night in their season; 
\v 21  \add Then\add* may also my covenant be broken with David my
servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne;
and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 
\v 22  As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand
of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant,
and the Levites that minister unto me. 
\v 23  Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Jeremiah, saying,
\v 24  Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying,
The two families which the \nd LORD\nd* hath chosen, he hath even cast them
off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a
nation before them. 
\v 25  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; If my covenant \add be\add* not with
day and night, \add and if\add* I have not appointed the ordinances
of heaven and earth; 
\v 26  Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant,
\add so\add* that I will not take \add any\add* of his seed \add to
be\add* rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their
captivity to return, and have mercy on them. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, when
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms
of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against
Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,\f + \fr 34.1 
\ft of his…: Heb. the dominion of his hand\f* 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel; Go and speak
to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*;
Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
and he shall burn it with fire: 
\v 3  And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely
be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold
the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth
to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.\f + \fr 34.3  \ft he shall…: Heb. his mouth shall speak to thy
mouth\f* 
\v 4  Yet hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, O Zedekiah king of Judah;
Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
\v 5  \add But\add* thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings
of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they
burn \add odours\add* for thee; and they will lament thee, \add saying\add*,
Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith  the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6  Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
\v 7  When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the
cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah:
for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ \add This is\add* the word that came unto Jeremiah from the
\nd LORD\nd*, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the
people which \add were\add* at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
\v 9  That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
maidservant, \add being\add* an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free;
that none should serve himself of them, \add to wit\add*, of a Jew
his brother. 
\v 10  Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered
into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant,
and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they
obeyed, and let \add them\add* go. 
\v 11  But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into
subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Therefore the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Jeremiah from the
\nd LORD\nd*, saying, 
\v 13  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel; I made a covenant
with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, 
\v 14  At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother
an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served
thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers
hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.\f + \fr 34.14 
\ft hath been…: or, hath sold himself\f* 
\v 15  And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a
covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:\f + \fr 34.15 
\ft now: Heb. to day\f*\f + \fr 34.15  \ft which…: Heb. whereupon my name is
called\f* 
\v 16  But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their
pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for
servants and for handmaids. 
\v 17  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Ye have not hearkened
unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every
man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;
and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.\f + \fr 34.17 
\ft to be…: Heb. for a removing\f* 
\v 18  And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had
made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the
parts thereof, 
\v 19  The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs,
and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the
parts of the calf; 
\v 20  I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the
hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for
meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
\v 21  And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the
hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their
life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone
up from you. 
\v 22  Behold, I will command, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and cause them to
return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and
burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation
without an inhabitant. 
\c 35  
\p
\v 1  The word which came unto Jeremiah from the \nd LORD\nd* in the
days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
\v 2  Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
bring them into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, into one of the chambers,
and give them wine to drink. 
\v 3  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,
and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
\v 4  And I brought them into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, into the
chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which
\add was\add* by the chamber of the princes, which \add was\add*
above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the
door:\f + \fr 35.4  \ft door: Heb. threshold, or, vessel\f* 
\v 5  And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
\v 6  But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, \add neither
ye\add*, nor your sons for ever: 
\v 7  Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have
\add any:\add* but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may
live many days in the land where ye \add be\add* strangers. 
\v 8  Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab
our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our
days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 
\v 9  Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard,
nor field, nor seed: 
\v 10  But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that
Jonadab our father commanded us. 
\v 11  But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came
up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem
for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the
Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Jeremiah, saying,
\v 13  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; Go
and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not
receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith  the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 14  The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded
his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they
drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have
spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.
\v 15  I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up
early and sending \add them\add*, saying, Return ye now every man
from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other
gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given
to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor
hearkened unto me. 
\v 16  Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this
people hath not hearkened unto me: 
\v 17  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of hosts, the God
of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have
spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not
answered. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have
obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts,
and done according unto all that he hath commanded you: 
\v 19  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of
Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before
me for ever.\f + \fr 35.19  \ft Jonadab…: Heb. There shall not a man be cut off from Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand,
etc\f* 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son
of Josiah king of Judah, \add that\add* this word came unto Jeremiah
from the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, 
\v 2  Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words
that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the
nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah,
even unto this day. 
\v 3  It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his
evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. 
\v 4  Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he had
spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. 
\v 5  And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I \add am\add* shut
up; I cannot go into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 6  Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written
from my mouth, the words of the \nd LORD\nd* in the ears of the people
in the \nd LORD’s\nd* house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt
read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
\v 7  It may be they will present their supplication before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and will return every one from his evil way: for great \add is\add*
the anger and the fury that the \nd LORD\nd* hath pronounced against this
people.\f + \fr 36.7  \ft they…: Heb. their supplication shall fail\f*
\v 8  And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the \nd LORD\nd*
in the \nd LORD’s\nd* house. 
\p
\v 9  And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son
of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, \add that\add* they
proclaimed a fast before the \nd LORD\nd* to all the people in Jerusalem,
and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.
\v 10  Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the
house of the \nd LORD\nd*, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of
Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new
gate of the \nd LORD’s\nd* house, in the ears of all the people.\f + \fr 36.10 
\ft entry: or, door\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
heard out of the book all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, 
\v 12  Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s
chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, \add even\add* Elishama
the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son
of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son
of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
\v 13  Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
\v 14  Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take
in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the
people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his
hand, and came unto them. 
\v 15  And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
So Baruch read \add it\add* in their ears. 
\v 16  Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were
afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell
the king of all these words. 
\v 17  And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
write all these words at his mouth? 
\v 18  Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his
mouth, and I wrote \add them\add* with ink in the book. 
\v 19  Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid
up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the
words in the ears of the king. 
\v 21  So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the
king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
\v 22  Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
\add there was a fire\add* on the hearth burning before him. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Jehudi had read three
or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast \add it\add*
into the fire that \add was\add* on the hearth, until all the roll
was consumed in the fire that \add was\add* on the hearth. 
\v 24  Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, \add neither\add*
the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. 
\v 25  Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession
to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
\v 26  But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take
Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the \nd LORD\nd*
hid them.\f + \fr 36.26  \ft of Hammelech: or, of the king\f* 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Jeremiah, after
that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote
at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 28  Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah
hath burned. 
\v 29  And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith
the \nd LORD\nd*; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou
written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come
and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and
beast? 
\v 30  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of Jehoiakim king of
Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead
body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the
frost. 
\v 31  And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced
against them; but they hearkened not.\f + \fr 36.31  \ft punish: Heb. visit

\p
\v 32 ¶ Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah
all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned
in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.\f + \fr 36.32 
\ft like: Heb. as they\f* 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1  And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah
the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king
in the land of Judah. 
\v 2  But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land,
did hearken unto the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake by
the prophet Jeremiah.\f + \fr 37.2  \ft by…: Heb. by the hand of the
prophet\f* 
\v 3  And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah,
saying, Pray now unto the \nd LORD\nd* our God for us. 
\v 4  Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not
put him into prison. 
\v 5  Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed
from Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto the prophet Jeremiah,
saying, 
\v 7  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye
say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold,
Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to
Egypt into their own land. 
\v 8  And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this
city, and take it, and burn it with fire. 
\v 9  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Deceive not yourselves, saying,
The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.\f + \fr 37.9 
\ft yourselves: Heb. your souls\f* 
\v 10  For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans
that fight against you, and there remained \add but\add* wounded

tent, and burn this city with fire.\f + \fr 37.10  \ft wounded: Heb. thrust

\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans
was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,\f + \fr 37.11 
\ft broken…: Heb. made to ascend\f* 
\v 12  Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.\f + \fr 37.12 
\ft separate…: or, to slip away from thence in the midst of the people\f*
\v 13  And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the
ward \add was\add* there, whose name \add was\add* Irijah, the son
of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet,
saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans. 
\v 14  Then said Jeremiah, \add It is\add* false; I fall not away
to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah,
and brought him to the princes.\f + \fr 37.14  \ft false: Heb. falsehood, or, a
lie\f* 
\v 15  Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote
him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had
made that the prison. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the
cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;\f + \fr 37.16 
\ft cabins: or, cells\f* 
\v 17  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king
asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there \add any\add*
word from the \nd LORD\nd*? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said
he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\v 18  Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended
against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have
put me in prison? 
\v 19 Where \add are\add* now your prophets which prophesied unto you,
saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this
land? 
\v 20  Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my
supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to
return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.\f + \fr 37.20 
\ft let…: Heb. let my supplication fall\f* 
\v 21  Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah
into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily
a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the
city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained  in the court of the prison.
\c 38  
\p
\v 1  Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah,
heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, He that remaineth in this city
shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth
forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a
prey, and shall live. 
\v 3  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, This city shall surely be given
into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.
\v 4  Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this
man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of
war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in
speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare
of this people, but the hurt.\f + \fr 38.4  \ft welfare: Heb. peace\f*
\v 5  Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he \add is\add* in your
hand: for the king \add is\add* not \add he that\add* can do \add any\add*
thing against you. 
\v 6  Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah
the son of Hammelech, that \add was\add* in the court of the prison:
and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon \add there
was\add* no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.\f + \fr 38.6 
\ft of Hammelech: or, of the king\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the
king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the
king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 
\v 8  Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the
king, saying, 
\v 9  My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have
done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon;
and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for \add there
is\add* no more bread in the city.\f + \fr 38.9  \ft he is like…: Heb. he will
die\f* 
\v 10  Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,
Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet
out of the dungeon, before he die.\f + \fr 38.10  \ft with thee: Heb. in thine
hand\f* 
\v 11  So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house
of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and
old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\v 12  And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now
\add these\add* old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes
under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. 
\v 13  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
unto him into the third entry that \add is\add* in the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a
thing; hide nothing from me.\f + \fr 38.14  \ft third: or, principal\f*
\v 15  Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare \add it\add*
unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee
counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me? 
\v 16  So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying,
\add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to
death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek
thy life. 
\v 17  Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth
unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this
city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine
house: 
\v 18  But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall
burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. 
\v 19  And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their
hand, and they mock me. 
\v 20  But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver \add thee\add*.
Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, which I speak
unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
\v 21  But if thou refuse to go forth, this \add is\add* the word
that the \nd LORD\nd* hath shewed me: 
\v 22  And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s
house \add shall be\add* brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those
\add women\add* shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have
prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, \add and\add*
they are turned away back.\f + \fr 38.22  \ft Thy friends: Heb. Men of thy

\v 23  So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the

taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this
city to be burned with fire.\f + \fr 38.23  \ft thou shalt cause…: Heb. thou shalt burn,
etc\f* 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
words, and thou shalt not die. 
\v 25  But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast
said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to
death; also what the king said unto thee: 
\v 26  Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s
house, to die there. 
\v 27  Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
told them according to all these words that the king had commanded.
So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.\f + \fr 38.27 
\ft they…: Heb. they were silent from him\f* 
\v 28  So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day
that Jerusalem was taken: and he was \add there\add* when Jerusalem
was taken. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1  In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,
came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem,
and they besieged it. 
\v 2  \add And\add* in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth
month, the ninth \add day\add* of the month, the city was broken
up. 
\v 3  And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat
in the middle gate, \add even\add* Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo,
Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue
of the princes of the king of Babylon. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Zedekiah the king
of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went
forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden,
by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the
plain. 
\v 5  But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah
in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him
up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath,
where he gave judgment upon him.\f + \fr 39.5  \ft gave…: Heb. spake with him

\v 6  Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of
Judah. 
\v 7  Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains,
to carry him to Babylon.\f + \fr 39.7  \ft with…: Heb. with two brasen chains, or,

\p
\v 8 ¶ And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses
of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 9  Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive
into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city,
and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the
people that remained.\f + \fr 39.9  \ft captain…: or, chief marshal: Heb. chief of the executioners, or,

\v 10  But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor

\v 13  So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,

\v 14  Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the
prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the
people. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
up in the court of the prison, saying, 
\v 16  Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith
the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring
my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be
\add accomplished\add* in that day before thee. 
\v 17  But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*:
and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou
\add art\add* afraid. 
\v 18  For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy
trust in me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1  The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, after
that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah,
when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away
captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto
Babylon.\f + \fr 40.1  \ft chains: or, manicles\f* 
\v 2  And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The

\v 3  Now the \nd LORD\nd* hath brought \add it\add*, and done according as he hath
said: because ye have sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*, and have not
obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. 
\v 4  And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
\add were\add* upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come
with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem
ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the

\v 5  Now while he was not yet gone back, \add he said\add*, Go back
also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king
of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell
with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient
unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a
reward, and let him go. 
\v 6  Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now when all the captains of the forces which \add were\add*
in the fields, \add even\add* they and their men, heard that the
king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the
land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the
poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\v 8  Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah
the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and
Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. 
\v 9  And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their
men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land,
and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 
\v 10  As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans,
which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits,

\v 11  Likewise when all the Jews that \add were\add* in Moab, and among the

heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had
set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 
\v 12  Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah,
and gathered wine and summer fruits very much. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
of the forces that \add were\add* in the fields, came to Gedaliah
to Mizpah, 
\v 14  And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay

\v 15  Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael

slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be

\v 16  But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of

\c 41  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass in the seventh month, \add that\add* Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the
princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the
son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in
Mizpah. 
\v 2  Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and
smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword,
and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the
land. 
\v 3  Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, \add even\add*
with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,
\add and\add* the men of war. 
\v 4  And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah,
and no man knew \add it\add*, 
\v 5  That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
Samaria, \add even\add* fourscore men, having their beards shaven,
and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings
and incense in their hand, to bring \add them\add* to the house of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to
meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he
met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.\f + \fr 41.6 
\ft weeping…: Heb. in going and weeping\f* 
\v 7 And it was \add so\add*, when they came into the midst of the
city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, \add and cast
them\add* into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that \add were\add* with him.
\v 8  But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay
us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley,
and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among
their brethren. 
\v 9  Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, \add was\add* it which
Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: \add and\add*
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with \add them that were\add*
slain.\f + \fr 41.9  \ft because…: or, near Gedaliah: Heb. by the hand, or, by the side of
Gedaliah\f* 
\v 10  Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that
\add were\add* in Mizpah, \add even\add* the king’s daughters, and all the
people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the
son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over
to the Ammonites. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
of the forces that \add were\add* with him, heard of all the evil
that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
\v 12  Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that \add are\add*
in Gibeon. 
\v 13 Now it came to pass, \add that\add* when all the people which
\add were\add* with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the
captains of the forces that \add were\add* with him, then they were
glad. 
\v 14  So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of
Kareah. 
\v 15  But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
eight men, and went to the Ammonites. 
\v 16  Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
of the forces that \add were\add* with him, all the remnant of the
people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from
Mizpah, after \add that\add* he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
\add even\add* mighty men of war, and the women, and the children,
and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: 
\v 17  And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,
which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 
\v 18  Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1  Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the
least even unto the greatest, came near, 
\v 2  And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God, \add even\add* for all this remnant; (for we are left \add but\add*
a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)\f + \fr 42.2  \ft Let…: or, Let our supplication fall before
thee\f* 
\v 3  That the \nd LORD\nd* thy God may shew us the way wherein we may
walk, and the thing that we may do. 
\v 4  Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard \add you;\add*
behold, I will pray unto the \nd LORD\nd* your God according to your
words; and it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whatsoever thing
the \nd LORD\nd* shall answer you, I will declare \add it\add* unto you; I will
keep nothing back from you. 
\v 5  Then they said to Jeremiah, The \nd LORD\nd* be a true and
faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things
for the which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God shall send thee to us. 
\v 6 Whether \add it be\add* good, or whether \add it be\add* evil,
we will obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God, to whom we send
thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the
\nd LORD\nd* our God. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
came unto Jeremiah. 
\v 8  Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
of the forces which \add were\add* with him, and all the people from the
least even to the greatest, 
\v 9  And said unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of
Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;
\v 10  If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull
\add you\add* down, and I will plant you, and not pluck \add you\add*
up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you. 
\v 11  Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid;
be not afraid of him, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: for I \add am\add*
with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. 
\v 12  And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to
return to your own land. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey
the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, 
\v 14  Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall
see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of
bread; and there will we dwell: 
\v 15  And now therefore hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, ye remnant
of Judah; Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel;
If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
\v 16 Then it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the sword, which ye
feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine,
whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt;
and there ye shall die.\f + \fr 42.16  \ft shall follow…: Heb. shall cleave after
you\f* 
\v 17  So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go
into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape
from the evil that I will bring upon them.\f + \fr 42.17  \ft So…: Heb. So shall all the men
be\f* 
\v 18  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel;
As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants
of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall
enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment,
and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
\p
\v 19 ¶ The \nd LORD\nd* hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of
Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished
you this day.\f + \fr 42.19  \ft admonished…: Heb. testified against
you\f* 
\v 20  For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the

our God; and according unto all that the \nd LORD\nd* our God shall
say, so declare unto us, and we will do \add it\add*.\f + \fr 42.20 
\ft ye dissembled…: or, ye have used deceit against your souls\f*
\v 21 And \add now\add* I have this day declared \add it\add* to you; but ye have not
obeyed the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, nor any \add thing\add*
for the which he hath sent me unto you. 
\v 22  Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword,
by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire
to go \add and\add* to sojourn.\f + \fr 42.22  \ft to go…: or, to go to
sojourn\f* 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Jeremiah had made an
end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*
their God, for which the \nd LORD\nd* their God had sent him to them,
\add even\add* all these words, 
\v 2  Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son
of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest
falsely: the \nd LORD\nd* our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into
Egypt to sojourn there: 
\v 3  But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for
to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to
death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. 
\v 4  So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, to
dwell in the land of Judah. 
\v 5  But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all
nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;
\v 6  \add Even\add* men, and women, and children, and the king’s
daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
\v 7  So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
voice of the \nd LORD\nd*: thus came they \add even\add* to Tahpanhes.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
saying, 
\v 9  Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay
in the brickkiln, which \add is\add* at the entry of Pharaoh’s house
in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 
\v 10  And say unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the
God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king
of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones
that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
\v 11  And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, \add and
deliver\add* such \add as are\add* for death to death; and such \add as
are\add* for captivity to captivity; and such \add as are\add* for the
sword to the sword. 
\v 12  And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall
array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his
garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. 
\v 13  He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that \add is\add*
in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians
shall he burn with fire.\f + \fr 43.13  \ft images: Heb. statues, or, standing

\c 44  
\p
\v 1  The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes,
and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have
seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the
cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they \add are\add* a desolation,
and no man dwelleth therein, 
\v 3  Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to
anger, in that they went to burn incense, \add and\add* to serve
other gods, whom they knew not, \add neither\add* they, ye, nor your
fathers. 
\v 4  Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
early and sending \add them\add*, saying, Oh, do not this abominable
thing that I hate. 
\v 5  But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
\v 6  Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are
wasted \add and\add* desolate, as at this day. 
\v 7  Therefore now thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of hosts,
the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye \add this\add* great evil
against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and
suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;\f + \fr 44.7 
\ft out…: Heb. out of the midst of Judah\f* 
\v 8  In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands,
burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be
gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a
curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
\v 9  Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness
of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own
wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed
in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?\f + \fr 44.9 
\ft wickedness…: Heb. wickednesses, or, punishments, etc\f* 
\v 10  They are not humbled \add even\add* unto this day, neither have they
feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before
you and before your fathers.\f + \fr 44.10  \ft humbled: Heb. contrite\f*
\p
\v 11 ¶ Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of
Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut
off all Judah. 
\v 12  And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their
faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be
consumed, \add and\add* fall in the land of Egypt; they shall \add even\add*
be consumed by the sword \add and\add* by the famine: they shall
die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the
famine: and they shall be an execration, \add and\add* an astonishment,
and a curse, and a reproach. 
\v 13  For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have
punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\v 14  So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the
land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should
return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to
return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.\f + \fr 44.14 
\ft have…: Heb. lift up their soul\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense
unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude,
even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros,
answered  Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 16  \add As for\add* the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the
name of the \nd LORD\nd*, we will not hearken unto thee. 
\v 17  But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own
mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out
drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our
kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets
of Jerusalem: for \add then\add* had we plenty of victuals, and were
well, and saw no evil.\f + \fr 44.17  \ft queen…: or, frame of heaven\f*\f + \fr 44.17 
\ft victuals: Heb. bread\f* 
\v 18  But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all \add things\add*,
and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 
\v 19  And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour
out drink offerings unto her, without our men?\f + \fr 44.19  \ft men: or,
husbands?\f* 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the
women, and to all the people which had given him \add that\add* answer,
saying, 
\v 21  The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your
princes, and the people of the land, did not the \nd LORD\nd* remember
them, and came it \add not\add* into his mind? 
\v 22  So that the \nd LORD\nd* could no longer bear, because of the
evil of your doings, \add and\add* because of the abominations which ye have
committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment,
and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 
\v 23  Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
against the \nd LORD\nd*, and have not obeyed the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*,
nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies;
therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day. 
\v 24  Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
women, Hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, all Judah that \add are\add*
in the land of Egypt: 
\v 25  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, saying;
Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled
with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have
vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely
perform your vows. 
\v 26  Therefore hear ye the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, all Judah
that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great
name, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that my name shall no more be named
in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,
The Lord \nd GOD\nd* liveth. 
\v 27  Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good:
and all the men of Judah that \add are\add* in the land of Egypt
shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an
end of them. 
\v 28  Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out
of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant
of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall
know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.\f + \fr 44.28  \ft mine…: Heb. from me, or, from
them\f* 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words
shall surely stand against you for evil: 
\v 30  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra
king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that
seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\p
\v 1  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake  unto Baruch the son
of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth
of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
of Judah, saying, 
\v 2  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, unto thee, O

\v 3  Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the \nd LORD\nd* hath added
grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

\add that\add* which I have built will I break down, and that which I have
planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. 
\v 5  And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek \add them\add*
not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the \nd LORD\nd*:
but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou

king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of

\v 10  And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
