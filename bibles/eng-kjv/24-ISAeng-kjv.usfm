\v 1  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add*
Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
\p
\v 2  Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the \nd LORD\nd*
hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
rebelled against me. 
\v 3  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: \add but\add*
Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. 
\v 4  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers,
children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*,
they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone
away backward.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft laden: Heb. of heaviness\f*\f + \fr 1.4 
\ft gone…: Heb. alienated, or, separated\f*

\ft revolt…: Heb. increase revolt\f* 
\v 6  From the sole of the foot even unto the head \add there is\add*
no soundness in it; \add but\add* wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified
with ointment.\f + \fr 1.6  \ft ointment: or, oil\f* 
\v 7  Your country \add is\add* desolate, your cities \add are\add*
burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and
\add it is\add* desolate, as overthrown by strangers.\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft overthrown…: Heb. the overthrow of\f* 
\v 8  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
\v 9  Except the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts had left unto us a very small
remnant, we should have been as Sodom, \add and\add* we should have been
like unto Gomorrah. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, ye rulers of Sodom; give
ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. 
\v 11  To what purpose \add is\add* the multitude of your sacrifices
unto me? saith the \nd LORD\nd*: I am full of the burnt offerings

of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft he goats: Heb. great he

\v 12  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your
hand, to tread my courts?\f + \fr 1.12  \ft to appear: Heb. to be
seen\f* 
\v 13  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new
moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with;
\add it is\add* iniquity, even the solemn meeting.\f + \fr 1.13 
\ft iniquity: or, grief\f* 
\v 14  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a
trouble unto me; I am weary to bear \add them\add*.

from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands
are full of blood.\f + \fr 1.15  \ft make…: Heb. multiply prayer\f*\f + \fr 1.15 
\ft blood: Heb. bloods\f* 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 
\v 17  Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
the fatherless, plead for the widow.\f + \fr 1.17  \ft relieve: or,
righten\f* 
\v 18  Come now, and let us reason together, saith the \nd LORD\nd*:
though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be
red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 
\v 19  If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
land: 
\v 20  But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the
sword: for the mouth of the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken \add it\add*.
\p
\v 21 ¶ How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. 
\v 22  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 
\v 23  Thy princes \add are\add* rebellious, and companions of thieves:
every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the
fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. 
\v 24  Therefore saith the Lord, the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the mighty
One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge
me of mine enemies:

thy dross, and take away all thy tin:\f + \fr 1.25  \ft purely: Heb. according to

\v 26  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors

righteousness.\f + \fr 1.27  \ft her…: or, they that return of her\f*

\add shall be\add* together, and they that forsake the \nd LORD\nd*
shall be consumed.\f + \fr 1.28  \ft destruction: Heb. breaking\f*
\v 29  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 
\v 30  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
that hath no water. 
\v 31  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark,
and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench \add them\add*.\f + \fr 1.31 
\ft maker…: or, and his work\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem. 
\v 2  And it shall come to pass in the last days, \add that\add*
the mountain of the \nd LORD’s\nd* house shall be established in the
top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
nations shall flow unto it.\f + \fr 2.2  \ft established: or, prepared\f*
\v 3  And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up
to the mountain of the \nd LORD\nd*, to the house of the God of Jacob;
and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
from Jerusalem. 
\v 4  And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\f + \fr 2.4  \ft pruninghooks: or,
scythes\f* 
\v 5  O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
because they be replenished from the east, and \add are\add* soothsayers
like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children
of strangers.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft from…: or, more than the\f*\f + \fr 2.6

\v 7  Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither \add is there
any\add* end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither
\add is there any\add* end of their chariots: 
\v 8  Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
hands, that which their own fingers have made: 
\v 9  And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore
forgive them not. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear
of the \nd LORD\nd*, and for the glory of his majesty. 
\v 11  The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
of men shall be bowed down, and the \nd LORD\nd* alone shall be exalted
in that day. 
\v 12  For the day of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts \add shall be\add* upon every
\add one that is\add* proud and lofty, and upon every \add one that
is\add* lifted up; and he shall be brought low: 
\v 13  And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, \add that are\add* high
and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 
\v 14  And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills \add that
are\add* lifted up, 
\v 15  And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 
\v 16  And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
pictures.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft pleasant…: Heb. pictures of desire\f*
\v 17  And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
of men shall be made low: and the \nd LORD\nd* alone shall be exalted
in that day. 
\v 18  And the idols he shall utterly abolish.\f + \fr 2.18  \ft he…: or, shall utterly pass
away\f* 
\v 19  And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
caves of the earth, for fear of the \nd LORD\nd*, and for the glory
of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\f + \fr 2.19 
\ft of the earth: Heb. of the dust\f* 
\v 20  In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
idols of gold, which they made \add each one\add* for himself to
worship, to the moles and to the bats;\f + \fr 2.20  \ft his idols of silver…: Heb. the idols of his silver,
etc\f*\f + \fr 2.20  \ft each…: or, for him\f* 
\v 21  To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged
rocks, for fear of the \nd LORD\nd*, and for the glory of his majesty,
when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. 
\v 22  Cease ye from man, whose breath \add is\add* in his nostrils:
for wherein is he to be accounted of? 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  For, behold, the Lord, the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, doth take
away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, 
\v 2  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,
and the prudent, and the ancient, 
\v 3  The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor,
and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.\f + \fr 3.3 
\ft the honourable…: Heb. a man eminent in countenance\f*\f + \fr 3.3 
\ft eloquent…: or, skilful of speech\f* 
\v 4  And I will give children \add to be\add* their princes, and
babes shall rule over them. 
\v 5  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every
one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the
ancient, and the base against the honourable. 
\v 6  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
father, \add saying\add*, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and
\add let\add* this ruin \add be\add* under thy hand: 
\v 7  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
for in my house \add is\add* neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
ruler of the people.\f + \fr 3.7  \ft swear: Heb. lift up the hand\f*\f + \fr 3.7 
\ft healer: Heb. binder up\f* 
\v 8  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
tongue and their doings \add are\add* against the \nd LORD\nd*, to
provoke the eyes of his glory. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they
declare their sin as Sodom, they hide \add it\add* not. Woe unto their
soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 
\v 10  Say ye to the righteous, that \add it shall be\add* well \add with
him:\add* for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 
\v 11  Woe unto the wicked! \add it shall be\add* ill \add with him:\add*
for the reward of his hands shall be given him.\f + \fr 3.11  \ft given…: Heb. done to
him\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ \add As for\add* my people, children \add are\add* their

\ft lead…: or, call thee blessed\f*\f + \fr 3.12  \ft destroy: Heb. swallow

\v 13  The \nd LORD\nd* standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge
the people. 
\v 14  The \nd LORD\nd* will enter into judgment with the ancients
of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
vineyard; the spoil of the poor \add is\add* in your houses.\f + \fr 3.14 
\ft eaten: or, burnt\f* 
\v 15 What mean ye \add that\add* ye beat my people to pieces, and
grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* of hosts.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Moreover the \nd LORD\nd* saith, Because the daughters of
Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton
eyes, walking and mincing \add as\add* they go, and making a tinkling
with their feet:\f + \fr 3.16  \ft wanton…: Heb. deceiving with their

their secret parts.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft discover: Heb. make naked\f*
\v 18  In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of \add their\add*
tinkling ornaments \add about their feet\add*, and \add their\add*
cauls, and \add their\add* round tires like the moon,\f + \fr 3.18 
\ft cauls: or, networks\f* 
\v 19  The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,\f + \fr 3.19 
\ft chains: or, sweet balls\f*\f + \fr 3.19  \ft mufflers: or, spangled

\v 20  The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
and the tablets, and the earrings,\f + \fr 3.20  \ft tablets: Heb. houses of the

\v 24 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* instead of sweet
smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well
set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;
\add and\add* burning instead of beauty. 
\v 25  Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.\f + \fr 3.25 
\ft mighty: Heb. might\f* 
\v 26  And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she \add being\add*
desolate shall sit upon the ground.\f + \fr 3.26  \ft desolate: or, emptied: Heb.

\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying,

\v 4  When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* will create upon every dwelling place
of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
\add shall be\add* a defence.\f + \fr 4.5  \ft upon all: or, above

\v 6  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime

\ft a very…: Heb. the horn of the son of oil\f* 
\v 2  And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and

\v 3  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. 
\v 4  What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
brought it forth wild grapes? 
\v 5  And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; \add and\add*
break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:\f + \fr 5.5 
\ft trodden…: Heb. for a treading\f* 
\v 6  And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the

of the righteous from him! 
\v 24  Therefore as the fire devoureth  the stubble, and the flame
consumeth the chaff, \add so\add* their root shall be as rottenness,

\add me\add* with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught

\v 14  Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work

\v 1  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
\add that\add* Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
defenced cities of Judah, and took them. 
\v 2  And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit
of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.

this wherein thou trustest? 
\v 5  I say, \add sayest thou\add*, (but \add they are but\add* vain

\add is\add* Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him. 
\v 7  But if thou say to me, We trust in the \nd LORD\nd* our God:
\add is it\add* not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah
hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
before this altar? 
\v 8  Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king
of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be
able on thy part to set riders upon them.\f + \fr 36.8  \ft pledges: or,

\v 9  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the

\v 10  And am I now come up without the \nd LORD\nd* against this
land to destroy it? the \nd LORD\nd* said unto me, Go up against this
land, and destroy it. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak,
I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand
\add it:\add* and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears
of the people that \add are\add* on the wall. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master
and to thee to speak these words? \add hath he\add* not \add sent
me\add* to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own
dung, and drink their own piss with you? 
\v 13  Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king
of Assyria. 
\v 14  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be
able to deliver you. 
\v 15  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
The \nd LORD\nd* will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 16  Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
Make \add an agreement\add* with me \add by\add* a present, and come
out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig
tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;\f + \fr 36.16

\v 17  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
\v 18  \add Beware\add* lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The \nd LORD\nd*
will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered  his
land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
\v 19 Where \add are\add* the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where \add are\add*
the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my

\v 20 Who \add are they\add* among all the gods of these lands, that have
delivered their land out of my hand, that the \nd LORD\nd* should
deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? 
\v 21  But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the
king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

\v 1  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard \add it\add*,

\v 2  And he sent Eliakim, who \add was\add* over the household,

\p
\v 8 ¶ So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\v 9  And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come
forth to make war with thee. And when he heard \add it\add*, he sent
messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
\v 10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
given into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done
to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
\v 12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
have destroyed, \add as\add* Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the

\v 13 Where \add is\add* the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad,
and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers,
and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and spread it before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 15  And Hezekiah prayed unto the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, 
\v 16  O \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest \add between\add*
the cherubims, thou \add art\add* the God, \add even\add* thou alone, of all the

\v 20  Now therefore, O \nd LORD\nd* our God, save us from his hand,
that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou \add art\add*

\p
\v 21 ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against

\v 22 This \add is\add* the word which the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken

against the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 24  By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said,
By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the

\v 2  And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious

answered, All that \add is\add* in mine house have they seen: there is

\v 21 ¶ Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with

\v 2  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, \add and\add* sit down,
O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive

\v 3  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Ye have sold yourselves for

\v 4  For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, My people went down aforetime
into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without

\v 5  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that my

\v 8  He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare

and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities

\v 4  Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded;

\v 10  And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their

when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did
choose \add that\add* wherein I delighted not. 
\v 13  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, Behold, my servants
shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink,
but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be
ashamed: 
\v 14  Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall
cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.\f + \fr 65.14 
\ft vexation: Heb. breaking\f* 
\v 15  And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the
Lord \nd GOD\nd* shall slay thee, and call his servants by another
name: 
\v 16  That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the
God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the
God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are
hid from mine eyes. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.\f + \fr 65.17 
\ft come…: Heb. come upon the heart\f* 
\v 18  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever \add in that\add* which I
create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people
a joy. 
\v 19  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of
crying. 
\v 20  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old
man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred
years old; but the sinner \add being\add* an hundred years old shall be
accursed. 
\v 21  And they shall build houses, and inhabit \add them;\add* and they shall
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
\v 22  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree \add are\add* the
days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their
hands.\f + \fr 65.22  \ft shall long…: Heb. shall make them continue long, or, shall wear
out\f* 
\v 23  They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they
\add are\add* the seed of the blessed of the \nd LORD\nd*, and their
offspring with them. 
\v 24  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;
and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
\v 25  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
eat straw like the bullock: and dust \add shall be\add* the serpent’s
meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 66  
\p
\v 1  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, The heaven \add is\add* my throne,
and the earth \add is\add* my footstool: where \add is\add* the house
that ye build unto me? and where \add is\add* the place of my rest?
\v 2 For all those \add things\add* hath mine hand made, and all those
\add things\add* have been, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: but to this \add man\add*
will I look, \add even\add* to \add him that is\add* poor and of a
contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. 
\v 3  He that killeth an ox \add is as if\add* he slew a man; he that
sacrificeth a lamb, \add as if\add* he cut off a dog’s neck; he that
offereth an oblation, \add as if he offered\add* swine’s blood; he that
burneth incense, \add as if\add* he blessed an idol. Yea, they have
chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.\f + \fr 66.3

\v 4  I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake,
they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose
\add that\add* in which I delighted not.\f + \fr 66.4  \ft delusions: or,
devices\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, ye that tremble at his
word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s
sake, said, Let the \nd LORD\nd* be glorified: but he shall appear
to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. 
\v 6  A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a
voice of the \nd LORD\nd* that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
\v 7  Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
she was delivered of a man child. 
\v 8  Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the
earth be made to bring forth in one day? \add or\add* shall a nation
be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth
her children. 
\v 9  Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith
the \nd LORD\nd*: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut \add the
womb\add*? saith thy God.\f + \fr 66.9  \ft not…: or, not beget?\f*
\v 10  Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that
love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 
\v 11  That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance
of her glory.\f + \fr 66.11  \ft abundance: or, brightness\f* 
\v 12  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will extend peace
to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing
stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon \add her\add*
sides, and be dandled upon \add her\add* knees. 
\v 13  As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be
comforted in Jerusalem. 
\v 14  And when ye see \add this\add*, your heart shall rejoice,
and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*
shall be known toward his servants, and \add his\add* indignation
toward his enemies. 
\p
\v 15  For, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* will come with fire, and with his
chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his
rebuke with flames of fire. 
\v 16  For by fire and by his sword will the \nd LORD\nd* plead with all
flesh: and the slain of the \nd LORD\nd* shall be many. 
\v 17  They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one \add tree\add* in the midst, eating  swine’s flesh,
and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 66.17  \ft behind…: or, one after another\f*
\v 18 For I \add know\add* their works and their thoughts: it shall
come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall
come, and see my glory. 
\v 19  And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
escape of them unto the nations, \add to\add* Tarshish, Pul, and
Lud, that draw the bow, \add to\add* Tubal, and Javan, \add to\add*
the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen
my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 
\v 20  And they shall bring all your brethren \add for\add* an offering
unto the \nd LORD\nd* out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots,
and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy
mountain Jerusalem, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, as the children of Israel
bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 66.20 
\ft litters: or, coaches\f* 
\v 21  And I will also take of them for priests \add and\add* for
Levites, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
shall remain before me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, so shall your seed
and your name remain. 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* from one new moon
to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come
to worship before me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 66.23  \ft from one new…: Heb. from new moon to his new moon, and from
sabbath to his sabbath\f* 
\v 24  And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the
men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die,
neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring
unto all flesh.
