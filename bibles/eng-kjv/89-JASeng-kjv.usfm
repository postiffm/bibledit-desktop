\mt1 THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. 
\p
\v 2  My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
\v 3  Knowing \add this\add*, that the trying of your faith worketh
patience. 
\v 4  But let patience have \add her\add* perfect work, that ye may
be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. 
\v 5  If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth
to all \add men\add* liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be
given him. 
\v 6  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
\v 7  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing
of the Lord. 
\v 8  A double minded man \add is\add* unstable in all his ways.
\v 9  Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
\v 10  But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower
of the grass he shall pass away. 
\v 11  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace
of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away
in his ways. 
\v 12  Blessed \add is\add* the man that endureth temptation: for
when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord
hath promised to them that love him. 
\v 13  Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 
\v 14  But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
lust, and enticed. 
\v 15  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and
sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 
\v 16  Do not err, my beloved brethren. 
\v 17  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning. 
\v 18  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. 
\p
\v 19  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 
\v 20  For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
\v 21  Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save
your souls. 
\v 22  But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
your own selves. 
\v 23  For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is
like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: 
\v 24  For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
\v 25  But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
\add therein\add*, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. 
\v 26  If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion \add is\add*
vain. 
\v 27  Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, \add and\add*
to keep himself unspotted from the world. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, \add the
Lord\add* of glory, with respect of persons. 
\v 2  For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
\v 3  And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor,
Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 
\v 4  Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
of evil thoughts? 
\v 5  Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor
of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath
promised to them that love him? 
\v 6  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
and draw you before the judgment seats? 
\v 7  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
called? 
\v 8  If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 
\v 9  But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced
of the law as transgressors. 
\v 10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in
one \add point\add*, he is guilty of all. 
\v 11  For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art
become a transgressor of the law. 
\v 12  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
law of liberty. 
\v 13  For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed
no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. 
\v 14  What \add doth it\add* profit, my brethren, though a man say
he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
\v 15  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
\v 16  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be \add ye\add*
warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are
needful to the body; what \add doth it\add* profit? 
\v 17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
\v 18  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew
me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by
my works. 
\v 19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
devils also believe, and tremble. 
\v 20  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
dead? 
\v 21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 
\v 22  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works
was faith made perfect? 
\v 23  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called
the Friend of God. 
\v 24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not
by faith only. 
\v 25  Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
when she had received the messengers, and had sent \add them\add*
out another way? 
\v 26  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
works is dead also. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
the greater condemnation. 
\v 2  For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
word, the same \add is\add* a perfect man, \add and\add* able also
to bridle the whole body. 
\v 3  Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey
us; and we turn about their whole body. 
\v 4  Behold also the ships, which though \add they be\add* so great,
and \add are\add* driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about
with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. 
\v 5  Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! 
\v 6  And the tongue \add is\add* a fire, a world of iniquity: so
is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body,
and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
hell. 
\v 7  For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 
\v 8  But the tongue can no man tame; \add it is\add* an unruly evil,
full of deadly poison. 
\v 9  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 
\v 10  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
brethren, these things ought not so to be. 
\v 11  Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet \add water\add*
and bitter? 
\v 12  Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either
a vine, figs? so \add can\add* no fountain both yield salt water
and fresh. 
\v 13  Who \add is\add* a wise man and endued with knowledge among
you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness
of wisdom. 
\v 14  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
not, and lie not against the truth. 
\v 15  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but \add is\add* earthly,
sensual, devilish. 
\v 16  For where envying and strife \add is\add*, there \add is\add*
confusion and every evil work. 
\v 17  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, \add and\add* easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good
fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 
\v 18  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
make peace. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  From whence \add come\add* wars and fightings among you? \add come
they\add* not hence, \add even\add* of your lusts that war in your
members? 
\v 2  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot
obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 
\v 3  Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
consume \add it\add* upon your lusts. 
\v 4  Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship
of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend
of the world is the enemy of God. 
\v 5  Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? 
\v 6  But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. 
\v 7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
flee from you. 
\v 8  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse \add your\add*
hands, \add ye\add* sinners; and purify \add your\add* hearts, \add ye\add*
double minded. 
\v 9  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
to mourning, and \add your\add* joy to heaviness. 
\v 10  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
you up. 
\v 11  Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh
evil of \add his\add* brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh
evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law,
thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
\v 12  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy:
who art thou that judgest another? 
\p
\v 13  Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into
such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get
gain: 
\v 14  Whereas ye know not what \add shall be\add* on the morrow.
For what \add is\add* your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth
for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 
\v 15  For that ye \add ought\add* to say, If the Lord will, we shall
live, and do this, or that. 
\v 16  But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is
evil. 
\v 17  Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth \add it\add*
not, to him it is sin. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Go to now, \add ye\add* rich men, weep and howl for your miseries
that shall come upon \add you\add*. 
\v 2  Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
\v 3  Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall
be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.
Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. 
\v 4  Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries
of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
sabaoth. 
\v 5  Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 
\v 6  Ye have condemned \add and\add* killed the just; \add and\add*
he doth not resist you. 
\p
\v 7  Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,
and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter
rain. 
\v 8  Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the
Lord draweth nigh. 
\v 9  Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
behold, the judge standeth before the door. 
\v 10  Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name
of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
\v 11  Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord
is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. 
\v 12  But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea
be yea; and \add your\add* nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
\v 13  Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing
psalms. 
\v 14  Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the
church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
name of the Lord: 
\v 15  And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be
forgiven him. 
\v 16  Confess \add your\add* faults one to another, and pray one
for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer
of a righteous man availeth much. 
\v 17  Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the
earth by the space of three years and six months. 
\v 18  And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
brought forth her fruit. 
\v 19  Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
him; 
\v 20  Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude
of sins.
