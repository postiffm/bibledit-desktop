\v 1  The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love
in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the
truth; 
\v 2  For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
us for ever. 
\v 3  Grace be with you, mercy, \add and\add* peace, from God the
Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in
truth and love. 
\p
\v 4  I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 
\v 5  And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment
unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love
one another. 
\v 6  And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This
is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should
walk in it. 
\v 7  For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
an antichrist. 
\v 8  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
wrought, but that we receive a full reward. 
\v 9  Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ,
he hath both the Father and the Son. 
\v 10  If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
him not into \add your\add* house, neither bid him God speed: 
\v 11  For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
deeds. 
\p
\v 12  Having many things to write unto you, I would not \add write\add*
with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face
to face, that our joy may be full. 
\v 13  The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
