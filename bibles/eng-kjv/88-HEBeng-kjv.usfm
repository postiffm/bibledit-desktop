\c 1  
\p
\v 1  God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets, 
\v 2  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by \add his\add* Son,
whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
worlds; 
\v 3  Who being the brightness of \add his\add* glory, and the express
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high; 
\v 4  Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than they. 
\v 5  For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art
my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him
a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? 
\v 6  And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world,
he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. 
\v 7  And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits,
and his ministers a flame of fire. 
\v 8  But unto the Son \add he saith\add*, Thy throne, O God, \add is\add*
for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness \add is\add* the sceptre
of thy kingdom. 
\v 9  Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
God, \add even\add* thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows. 
\v 10  And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation
of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: 
\v 11  They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
old as doth a garment; 
\v 12  And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. 
\v 13  But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? 
\v 14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
for them who shall be heirs of salvation? 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have
heard, lest at any time we should let \add them\add* slip. 
\v 2  For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 
\v 3  How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto
us by them that heard \add him\add*; 
\v 4  God also bearing \add them\add* witness, both with signs and
wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according
to his own will? 
\p
\v 5  For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world
to come, whereof we speak. 
\v 6  But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest
him? 
\v 7  Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy
hands: 
\v 8  Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For
in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing \add that
is\add* not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put
under him. 
\v 9  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he
by the grace of God should taste death for every man. 
\v 10  For it became him, for whom \add are\add* all things, and
by whom \add are\add* all things, in bringing many sons unto glory,
to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
\v 11  For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified \add are\add*
all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
\v 12  Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
of the church will I sing praise unto thee. 
\v 13  And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I
and the children which God hath given me. 
\v 14  Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through
death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is,
the devil; 
\v 15  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage. 
\v 16  For verily he took not on \add him the nature of\add* angels;
but he took on \add him\add* the seed of Abraham. 
\v 17  Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
\add his\add* brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful
high priest in things \add pertaining\add* to God, to make reconciliation
for the sins of the people. 
\v 18  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is
able to succour them that are tempted. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
\v 2  Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses \add was
faithful\add* in all his house. 
\v 3  For this \add man\add* was counted worthy of more glory than
Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
than the house. 
\v 4  For every house is builded by some \add man\add*; but he that
built all things \add is\add* God. 
\v 5  And Moses verily \add was\add* faithful in all his house, as
a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken
after; 
\v 6  But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we,
if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
unto the end. 
\v 7  Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear
his voice, 
\v 8  Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
temptation in the wilderness: 
\v 9  When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty
years. 
\v 10  Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
do alway err in \add their\add* heart; and they have not known my
ways. 
\v 11  So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
\v 12  Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
\v 13  But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
\v 14  For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
of our confidence stedfast unto the end; 
\v 15  While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden
not your hearts, as in the provocation. 
\v 16  For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
that came out of Egypt by Moses. 
\v 17  But with whom was he grieved forty years? \add was it\add*
not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
\v 18  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest,
but to them that believed not? 
\v 19  So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left \add us\add*
of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of
it. 
\v 2  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them:
but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith
in them that heard \add it\add*. 
\v 3  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said,
As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although
the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
\v 4  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh \add day\add*
on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
\v 5  And in this \add place\add* again, If they shall enter into
my rest. 
\v 6  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of
unbelief: 
\v 7  Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice,
harden not your hearts. 
\v 8  For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
have spoken of another day. 
\v 9  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 
\v 10  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased
from his own works, as God \add did\add* from his. 
\v 11  Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any
man fall after the same example of unbelief. 
\v 12  For the word of God \add is\add* quick, and powerful, and
sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder
of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and \add is\add*
a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 
\v 13  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
sight: but all things \add are\add* naked and opened unto the eyes
of him with whom we have to do. 
\v 14  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast \add our\add*
profession. 
\v 15  For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as \add we are,
yet\add* without sin. 
\v 16  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for
men in things \add pertaining\add* to God, that he may offer both
gifts and sacrifices for sins: 
\v 2  Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the
way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. 
\v 3  And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
himself, to offer for sins. 
\v 4  And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
called of God, as \add was\add* Aaron. 
\v 5  So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten
thee. 
\v 6  As he saith also in another \add place\add*, Thou \add art\add*
a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
\v 7  Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was
able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 
\v 8  Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
which he suffered; 
\v 9  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
unto all them that obey him; 
\v 10  Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
\p
\v 11  Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
seeing ye are dull of hearing. 
\v 12  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
that one teach you again which \add be\add* the first principles
of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk,
and not of strong meat. 
\v 13  For every one that useth milk \add is\add* unskilful in the
word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 
\v 14  But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, \add even\add*
those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern
both good and evil. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of
repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
\v 2  Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and
of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 
\v 3  And this will we do, if God permit. 
\v 4  For \add it is\add* impossible for those who were once enlightened,
and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
the Holy Ghost, 
\v 5  And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
world to come, 
\v 6  If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put
\add him\add* to an open shame. 
\v 7  For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed,
receiveth blessing from God: 
\v 8  But that which beareth thorns and briers \add is\add* rejected,
and \add is\add* nigh unto cursing; whose end \add is\add* to be
burned. 
\v 9  But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
accompany salvation, though we thus speak. 
\v 10  For God \add is\add* not unrighteous to forget your work and
labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered
to the saints, and do minister. 
\v 11  And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence
to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 
\v 12  That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
faith and patience inherit the promises. 
\v 13  For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear
by no greater, he sware by himself, 
\v 14  Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying
I will multiply thee. 
\v 15  And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
\v 16  For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation
\add is\add* to them an end of all strife. 
\v 17  Wherein  God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs
of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed \add it\add*
by an oath: 
\v 18  That by two immutable things, in which \add it was\add* impossible
for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for
refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: 
\v 19  Which \add hope\add* we have as an anchor of the soul, both
sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
\v 20  Whither the forerunner is for us entered, \add even\add* Jesus,
made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and
blessed him; 
\v 2  To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of
Salem, which is, King of peace; 
\v 3  Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of
God; abideth a priest continually. 
\v 4  Now consider how great this man \add was\add*, unto whom even
the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 
\v 5  And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the
priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according
to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the
loins of Abraham: 
\v 6  But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 
\v 7  And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
\v 8  And here men that die receive tithes; but there he \add receiveth
them\add*, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 
\v 9  And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed
tithes in Abraham. 
\v 10  For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec
met him. 
\v 11  If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood,
(for under it the people received the law,) what further need \add was
there\add* that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec,
and not be called after the order of Aaron? 
\v 12  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity
a change also of the law. 
\v 13  For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 
\v 14  For \add it is\add* evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda;
of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. 
\v 15  And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude
of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 
\v 16  Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
after the power of an endless life. 
\v 17  For he testifieth, Thou \add art\add* a priest for ever after
the order of Melchisedec. 
\v 18  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 
\v 19  For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
better hope \add did\add*; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 
\v 20  And inasmuch as not without an oath \add he was made priest\add*:
\v 21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with
an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent,
Thou \add art\add* a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
\v 22  By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
\v 23  And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered
to continue by reason of death: 
\v 24  But this \add man\add*, because he continueth ever, hath an
unchangeable priesthood. 
\v 25  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
for them. 
\v 26  For such an high priest became us, \add who is\add* holy,
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
heavens; 
\v 27  Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for
this he did once, when he offered up himself. 
\v 28  For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity;
but the word of the oath, which was since the law, \add maketh\add*
the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Now of the things which we have spoken \add this is\add* the
sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
throne of the Majesty in the heavens; 
\v 2  A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which
the Lord pitched, and not man. 
\v 3  For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore \add it is\add* of necessity that this man have somewhat
also to offer. 
\v 4  For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there
are priests that offer gifts according to the law: 
\v 5  Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle:
for, See, saith he, \add that\add* thou make all things according
to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. 
\v 6  But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established
upon better promises. 
\v 7  For if that first \add covenant\add* had been faultless, then should
no place have been sought for the second. 
\v 8  For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of
Israel and with the house of Judah: 
\v 9  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land
of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded
them not, saith the Lord. 
\v 10  For this \add is\add* the covenant that I will make with the
house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to
them a God, and they shall be to me a people: 
\v 11  And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every
man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from
the least to the greatest. 
\v 12  For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. 
\v 13  In that he saith, A new \add covenant\add*, he hath made the
first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old \add is\add* ready
to vanish away. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Then verily the first \add covenant\add* had also ordinances
of divine service, and a worldly  sanctuary. 
\v 2  For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein \add was\add*
the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called
the sanctuary. 
\v 3  And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
Holiest of all; 
\v 4  Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid
round about with gold, wherein \add was\add* the golden pot that
had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
\v 5  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat;
of which we cannot  now speak particularly. 
\v 6  Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service \add of
God\add*. 
\v 7  But into the second \add went\add* the high priest alone once
every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and
\add for\add* the errors of the people: 
\v 8  The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of
all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was
yet standing: 
\v 9  Which \add was\add* a figure for the time then present, in
which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make
him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
\v 10  \add Which stood\add* only in meats and drinks, and divers
washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed \add on them\add* until
the time of reformation. 
\v 11  But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come,
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that
is to say, not of this building; 
\v 12  Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
\add for us\add*. 
\v 13  For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
flesh: 
\v 14  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God? 
\v 15  And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions
\add that were\add* under the first testament, they which are called
might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. 
\v 16  For where a testament \add is\add*, there must also of necessity be
the death of the testator. 
\v 17  For a testament \add is\add* of force after men are dead:
otherwise it is of no strength  at all while the testator liveth.
\v 18  Whereupon neither the first \add testament\add* was dedicated
without blood. 
\v 19  For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with
water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book,
and all the people, 
\v 20  Saying, This \add is\add* the blood of the testament which
God hath enjoined unto you. 
\v 21  Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and
all the vessels of the ministry. 
\v 22  And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
without shedding of blood is no remission. 
\v 23  \add It was\add* therefore necessary that the patterns of
things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly
things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
\v 24  For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
\add which are\add* the figures of the true; but into heaven itself,
now to appear in the presence of God for us: 
\v 25  Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; 
\v 26  For then must he often have suffered since the foundation
of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared
to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
\v 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
the judgment: 
\v 28  So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look
for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, \add and\add*
not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto
perfect. 
\v 2  For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience
of sins. 
\v 3  But in those \add sacrifices there is\add* a remembrance again
\add made\add* of sins every year. 
\v 4  For \add it is\add* not possible that the blood of bulls and
of goats should take away sins. 
\v 5  Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
\v 6  In burnt offerings and \add sacrifices\add* for sin thou hast
had no pleasure. 
\v 7  Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
of me,) to do thy will, O God. 
\v 8  Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
and \add offering\add* for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
\add therein\add*; which are offered by the law; 
\v 9  Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
the first, that he may establish the second. 
\v 10  By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
body of Jesus Christ once \add for all\add*. 
\v 11  And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: 
\v 12  But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; 
\v 13  From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
\v 14  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified. 
\v 15  \add Whereof\add* the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us:
for after that he had said before, 
\v 16  This \add is\add* the covenant that I will make with them
after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,
and in their minds will I write them; 
\v 17  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. 
\v 18  Now where remission of these \add is, there is\add* no more
offering for sin. 
\p
\v 19  Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
by the blood of Jesus, 
\v 20  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
\v 21  And \add having\add* an high priest over the house of God;
\v 22  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
washed with pure water. 
\v 23  Let us hold fast the profession of \add our\add* faith without
wavering; (for he \add is\add* faithful that promised;) 
\v 24  And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
good works: 
\v 25  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
manner of some \add is\add*; but exhorting \add one another\add*:
and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. 
\v 26  For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 
\v 27  But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation,
which shall devour the adversaries. 
\v 28  He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or
three witnesses: 
\v 29  Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted
the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
\v 30  For we know him that hath said, Vengeance \add belongeth\add*
unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall
judge his people. 
\v 31  \add It is\add* a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God. 
\v 32  But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; 
\v 33  Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches
and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that
were so used. 
\v 34  For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully
the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in
heaven a better and an enduring substance. 
\v 35  Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
recompence of reward. 
\v 36  For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
will of God, ye might receive the promise. 
\v 37  For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come,
and will not tarry. 
\v 38  Now the just shall live by faith: but if \add any man\add*
draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
\v 39  But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that
believe to the saving of the soul. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
of things not seen. 
\v 2  For by it the elders obtained a good report. 
\v 3  Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
appear. 
\v 4  By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying
of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
\v 5  By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;
and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his
translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
\v 6  But without faith \add it is\add* impossible to please \add him\add*:
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and \add that\add*
he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
\v 7  By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the
which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness
which is by faith. 
\v 8  By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went
out, not knowing whither he went. 
\v 9  By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as \add in\add*
a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob,
the heirs with him of the same promise: 
\v 10  For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder
and maker \add is\add* God. 
\v 11  Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because
she judged him faithful who had promised. 
\v 12  Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
\add so many\add* as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the
sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. 
\v 13  These all died in faith, not having received the promises,
but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of \add them\add*,
and embraced \add them\add*, and confessed that they were strangers
and pilgrims on the earth. 
\v 14  For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek
a country. 
\v 15  And truly, if they had been mindful of that \add country\add*
from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
returned. 
\v 16  But now they desire a better \add country\add*, that is, an
heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for
he hath prepared for them a city. 
\v 17  By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and
he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten \add son\add*,
\v 18  Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
\v 19  Accounting that God \add was\add* able to raise \add him\add*
up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
\v 20  By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
come. 
\v 21  By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons
of Joseph; and worshipped, \add leaning\add* upon the top of his
staff. 
\v 22  By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing
of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
\v 23  By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of
his parents, because they saw \add he was\add* a proper child; and
they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. 
\v 24  By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; 
\v 25  Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
\v 26  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 
\v 27  By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
\v 28  Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of
blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
\v 29  By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry \add land\add*:
which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. 
\v 30  By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed
about seven days. 
\v 31  By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
not, when she had received the spies with peace. 
\v 32  And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell
of Gedeon, and \add of\add* Barak, and \add of\add* Samson, and \add of\add*
Jephthae; \add of\add* David also, and Samuel, and \add of\add* the
prophets: 
\v 33  Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
\v 34  Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
flight the armies of the aliens. 
\v 35  Women received their dead raised to life again: and others
were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain
a better resurrection: 
\v 36  And others had trial of \add cruel\add* mockings and scourgings,
yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 
\v 37  They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;
being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 
\v 38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts,
and \add in\add* mountains, and \add in\add* dens and caves of the
earth. 
\v 39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
received not the promise: 
\v 40  God having provided some better thing for us, that they without
us should not be made perfect. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great
a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
which doth so easily beset \add us\add*, and let us run with patience
the race that is set before us, 
\v 2  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of \add our\add*
faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne
of God. 
\v 3  For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 
\v 4  Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
\v 5  And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the
Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 
\v 6  For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth. 
\v 7  If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
\v 8  But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
then are ye bastards, and not sons. 
\v 9  Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
\add us\add*, and we gave \add them\add* reverence: shall we not
much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
\v 10  For they verily for a few days chastened \add us\add* after
their own pleasure; but he for \add our\add* profit, that \add we\add*
might be partakers of his holiness. 
\v 11  Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit
of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. 
\v 12  Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
knees; 
\v 13  And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. 
\v 14  Follow peace with all \add men\add*, and holiness, without
which no man shall see the Lord: 
\v 15  Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God;
lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble  \add you\add*,
and thereby many be defiled; 
\v 16  Lest there \add be\add* any fornicator, or profane person,
as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. 
\v 17  For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance,
though he sought it carefully with tears. 
\v 18  For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched,
and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
tempest, 
\v 19  And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which
\add voice\add* they that heard intreated that the word should not
be spoken to them any more: 
\v 20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much
as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through
with a dart: 
\v 21  And so terrible  was the sight, \add that\add* Moses said,
I exceedingly fear and quake:) 
\v 22  But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company
of angels, 
\v 23  To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits
of just men made perfect, 
\v 24  And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than \add that of\add*
Abel. 
\v 25  See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
not who refused him that spake on earth, much more \add shall not\add*
we \add escape\add*, if we turn away from him that \add speaketh\add*
from heaven: 
\v 26  Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
\v 27  And this \add word\add*, Yet once more, signifieth the removing
of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that
those things which cannot be shaken may remain. 
\v 28  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear: 
\v 29  For our God \add is\add* a consuming fire. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  Let brotherly love continue. 
\v 2  Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares. 
\v 3  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; \add and\add*
them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
\v 4  Marriage \add is\add* honourable in all, and the bed undefiled:
but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. 
\v 5  \add Let your\add* conversation \add be\add* without covetousness;
\add and be\add* content with such things as ye have: for he hath
said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. 
\v 6  So that we may boldly say, The Lord \add is\add* my helper,
and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. 
\p
\v 7  Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken
unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end
of \add their\add* conversation. 
\v 8  Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
\v 9  Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For
\add it is\add* a good thing that the heart be established with grace;
not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied
therein. 
\v 10  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
serve the tabernacle. 
\v 11  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the
camp. 
\v 12  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
his own blood, suffered without the gate. 
\v 13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
his reproach. 
\v 14  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
\v 15  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of \add our\add* lips giving thanks
to his name. 
\v 16  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased. 
\v 17  Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that
they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that \add is\add*
unprofitable for you. 
\p
\v 18  Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
things willing to live honestly. 
\v 19  But I beseech \add you\add* the rather to do this, that I may be
restored to you the sooner. 
\v 20  Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of
the everlasting covenant, 
\v 21  Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working
in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ;
to whom \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
\v 22  And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation:
for I have written a letter unto you in few words. 
\v 23  Know ye that \add our\add* brother Timothy is set at liberty;
with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 
\v 24  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.
They of Italy salute you. 
\v 25  Grace \add be\add* with you all. Amen. 
\s1 Written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy.
