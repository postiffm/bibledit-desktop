\p
\v 1  The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
\v 2  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all
\add is\add* vanity. 
\v 3  What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
sun? 
\p
\v 4  \add One\add* generation passeth away, and \add another\add*
generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 
\v 5  The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his
place where he arose.\f + \fr 1.5  \ft hasteth: Heb. panteth\f* 
\v 6  The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again
according to his circuits. 
\v 7  All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea \add is\add* not
full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
again.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft return…: Heb. return to go\f* 
\v 8  All things \add are\add* full of labour; man cannot utter \add it:\add*
the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
\p
\v 9 The thing that hath been, it \add is that\add* which shall be; and that which is
done \add is\add* that which shall be done: and \add there is\add*
no new \add thing\add* under the sun. 
\v 10  Is there \add any\add* thing whereof it may be said, See, this
\add is\add* new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
\v 11  \add There is\add* no remembrance of former \add things;\add* neither shall there be
\add any\add* remembrance of \add things\add* that are to come with
\add those\add* that shall come after. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
\v 13  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
\add things\add* that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath
God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.\f + \fr 1.13 
\ft to be…: or, to afflict them\f* 
\v 14  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all
\add is\add* vanity and vexation of spirit. 
\v 15  \add That which is\add* crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is
wanting cannot be numbered.\f + \fr 1.15  \ft that which is wanting: Heb.
defect\f* 
\v 16  I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all \add they\add* that have been
before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom
and knowledge.\f + \fr 1.16  \ft had…: Heb. had seen much\f* 
\v 17  And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
\v 18  For in much wisdom \add is\add* much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth  sorrow. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also \add is\add* vanity.
\v 2  I said of laughter, \add It is\add* mad: and of mirth, What
doeth it? 
\v 3  I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting
mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what
\add was\add* that good for the sons of men, which they should do
under the heaven all the days of their life.\f + \fr 2.3  \ft to give…: Heb. to draw my flesh with
wine\f*\f + \fr 2.3  \ft all…: Heb. the number of the days of their
life\f* 
\v 4  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
\v 5  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all
\add kind of\add* fruits: 
\v 6  I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth
forth trees: 
\v 7  I got \add me\add* servants and maidens, and had servants born
in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
above all that were in Jerusalem before me:\f + \fr 2.7  \ft servants born…: Heb. sons of my
house\f* 
\v 8  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers,
and the delights of the sons of men, \add as\add* musical instruments, and that of all
sorts.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft musical…: Heb. musical instrument and instruments\f*
\v 9  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
\v 10  And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour:
and this was my portion of all my labour. 
\v 11  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,
and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all \add was\add*
vanity and vexation of spirit, and \add there was\add* no profit
under the sun. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what
\add can\add* the man \add do\add* that cometh after the king? \add even\add*
that which hath been already done.\f + \fr 2.12  \ft even…: or, in those things which have been already
done\f* 
\v 13  Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
darkness.\f + \fr 2.13  \ft that…: Heb. that there is an excellency in wisdom more than in folly,
etc\f* 
\v 14  The wise man’s eyes \add are\add* in his head; but the fool
walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
\v 15  Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my
heart, that this also \add is\add* vanity.\f + \fr 2.15  \ft happeneth even…: Heb. happeneth to me, even to
me\f* 
\v 16 For \add there is\add* no remembrance of the wise more than
of the fool for ever; seeing that which now \add is\add* in the days
to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise \add man\add*?
as the fool. 
\p
\v 17  Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the
sun \add is\add* grievous unto me: for all \add is\add* vanity and
vexation of spirit. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.\f + \fr 2.18 
\ft taken: Heb. laboured\f* 
\v 19  And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise \add man\add* or a
fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This \add is\add*
also vanity. 
\v 20  Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
labour which I took under the sun. 
\v 21  For there is a man whose labour \add is\add* in wisdom, and in
knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it \add for\add* his portion. This also \add is\add* vanity
and a great evil.\f + \fr 2.21  \ft leave: Heb. give\f* 
\v 22  For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 
\v 23  For all his days \add are\add* sorrows, and his travail grief;
yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
\p
\v 24 ¶ \add There is\add* nothing better for a man, \add than\add*
that he should eat and drink, and \add that\add* he should make his
soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it \add was\add*
from the hand of God.\f + \fr 2.24  \ft should make…: or, delight his
senses\f* 
\v 25  For who can eat, or who else can hasten \add hereunto\add*,
more than I? 
\v 26 For \add God\add* giveth to a man that \add is\add* good in his
sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth
travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to \add him that
is\add* good before God. This also \add is\add* vanity and vexation
of spirit.\f + \fr 2.26  \ft in his…: Heb. before him\f* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 To every \add thing there is\add* a season, and a time to every
purpose under the heaven: 
\v 2  A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
time to pluck up \add that which is\add* planted;\f + \fr 3.2  \ft to be…: Heb. to
bear\f* 
\v 3  A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a
time to build up; 
\v 4  A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
time to dance; 
\v 5  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;\f + \fr 3.5 
\ft to refrain from: Heb. to be far from\f* 
\v 6  A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
to cast away;\f + \fr 3.6  \ft get: or, seek\f* 
\v 7  A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence,
and a time to speak; 
\v 8  A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
of peace. 
\v 9  What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
\v 10  I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons
of men to be exercised in it. 
\p
\v 11  He hath made every \add thing\add* beautiful in his time:
also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find
out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. 
\v 12  I know that \add there is\add* no good in them, but for \add a
man\add* to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 
\v 13  And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
good of all his labour, it \add is\add* the gift of God. 
\v 14  I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing
can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth \add it\add*, that
\add men\add* should fear before him. 
\v 15  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
already been; and God requireth that which is past.\f + \fr 3.15 
\ft that which is past: Heb. that which is driven away\f* 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, \add that\add*
wickedness \add was\add* there; and the place of righteousness, \add that\add*
iniquity \add was\add* there. 
\v 17  I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
wicked: for \add there is\add* a time there for every purpose and for every
work. 
\v 18  I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of
men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they
themselves are beasts.\f + \fr 3.18  \ft that God…: or, that they might clear God, and see,
etc\f* 
\v 19  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other;
yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence
above a beast: for all \add is\add* vanity. 
\v 20  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
dust again. 
\v 21  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?\f + \fr 3.21  \ft of man: Heb. of the sons of
man\f*\f + \fr 3.21  \ft goeth upward: Heb. is ascending, etc\f*
\v 22  Wherefore I perceive that \add there is\add* nothing better,
than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that \add is\add*
his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
done under the sun: and behold the tears of \add such as were\add*
oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors
\add there was\add* power; but they had no comforter.\f + \fr 4.1 
\ft side: Heb. hand\f* 
\v 2  Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the
living which are yet alive. 
\v 3  Yea, better \add is he\add* than both they, which hath not
yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the
sun. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a
man is envied of his neighbour. This \add is\add* also vanity and
vexation of spirit.\f + \fr 4.4  \ft every…: Heb. all the rightness of
work\f*\f + \fr 4.4  \ft for this…: Heb. this is the envy of a man from his
neighbour\f* 
\v 5  The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
\v 6  Better \add is\add* an handful \add with\add* quietness, than both the
hands full \add with\add* travail and vexation of spirit. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
\v 8  There is one \add alone\add*, and \add there is\add* not a
second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet \add is there\add*
no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
\add saith he\add*, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of
good? This \add is\add* also vanity, yea, it \add is\add* a sore
travail. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Two \add are\add* better than one; because they have a good
reward for their labour. 
\v 10  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him
\add that is\add* alone when he falleth; for \add he hath\add* not
another to help him up. 
\v 11  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
one be warm \add alone\add*? 
\v 12  And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
threefold cord is not quickly broken. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Better \add is\add* a poor and a wise child than an old and
foolish king, who will no more be admonished.\f + \fr 4.13  \ft who…: Heb. who knoweth not to be
admonished\f* 
\v 14  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also \add he that
is\add* born in his kingdom becometh poor. 
\v 15  I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
second child that shall stand up in his stead. 
\v 16  \add There is\add* no end of all the people, \add even\add*
of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not
rejoice in him. Surely this also \add is\add* vanity and vexation
of spirit. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider
not that they do evil. 
\v 2  Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
to utter \add any\add* thing before God: for God \add is\add* in
heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.\f + \fr 5.2 
\ft thing: or, word\f* 
\v 3  For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
fool’s voice \add is known\add* by multitude of words. 
\p
\v 4  When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for \add he
hath\add* no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 
\v 5  Better \add is it\add* that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest
vow and not pay. 
\v 6  Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
thou before the angel, that it \add was\add* an error: wherefore should
God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
\v 7  For in the multitude of dreams and many words \add there are\add* also
\add divers\add* vanities: but fear thou God. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for
\add he that is\add* higher than the highest regardeth; and \add there
be\add* higher than they.\f + \fr 5.8  \ft at the…: Heb. at the will, or,
purpose\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king \add himself\add*
is served by the field. 
\v 10  He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this \add is\add* also
vanity. 
\v 11  When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what
good \add is there\add* to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
\add of them\add* with their eyes? 
\v 12  The sleep of a labouring man \add is\add* sweet, whether he
eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer
him to sleep. 
\v 13  There is a sore evil \add which\add* I have seen under the
sun, \add namely\add*, riches kept for the owners thereof to their
hurt. 
\v 14  But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth
a son, and \add there is\add* nothing in his hand. 
\v 15  As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return
to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry
away in his hand. 
\v 16  And this also \add is\add* a sore evil, \add that\add* in all
points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath
laboured for the wind? 
\v 17  All his days also he eateth in darkness, and \add he hath\add*
much sorrow and wrath with his sickness. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Behold \add that\add* which I have seen: \add it is\add*
good and comely \add for one\add* to eat and to drink, and to enjoy
the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days
of his life, which God giveth him: for it \add is\add* his portion.\f + \fr 5.18 
\ft it is good…: Heb. there is a good which is comely, etc\f*\f + \fr 5.18 
\ft all the days: Heb. the number of the days\f* 
\v 19  Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him
power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his
labour; this \add is\add* the gift of God. 
\v 20  For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
God answereth  \add him\add* in the joy of his heart.\f + \fr 5.20 
\ft For…: or, Though he give not much, yet he remembereth, etc\f*
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it \add is\add*
common among men: 
\v 2  A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he
wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not
power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this \add is\add*
vanity, and it \add is\add* an evil disease. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ If a man beget an hundred \add children\add*, and live many
years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not
filled with good, and also \add that\add* he have no burial; I say,
\add that\add* an untimely birth \add is\add* better than he. 
\v 4  For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his
name shall be covered with darkness. 
\v 5  Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known \add any thing:\add*
this hath more rest than the other. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Yea, though he live a thousand years twice \add told\add*,
yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place? 
\p
\v 7  All the labour of man \add is\add* for his mouth, and yet the
appetite is not filled.\f + \fr 6.7  \ft appetite: Heb. soul\f* 
\v 8  For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
that knoweth to walk before the living? 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Better \add is\add* the sight of the eyes than the wandering
of the desire: this \add is\add* also vanity and vexation of spirit.\f + \fr 6.9 
\ft than…: Heb. than the walking of the soul\f* 
\v 10  That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
\add is\add* man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what \add is\add*
man the better? 
\v 12  For who knoweth what \add is\add* good for man in \add this\add*
life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow?
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?\f + \fr 6.12 
\ft all…: Heb. the number of the days of the life of his vanity\f*
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  A good name \add is\add* better than precious ointment; and the
day of death than the day of one’s birth. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ \add It is\add* better to go to the house of mourning, than to
go to the house of feasting: for that \add is\add* the end of all
men; and the living will lay \add it\add* to his heart. 
\v 3  Sorrow \add is\add* better than laughter: for by the sadness
of the countenance the heart is made better.\f + \fr 7.3  \ft Sorrow: or,
Anger\f* 
\v 4  The heart of the wise \add is\add* in the house of mourning;
but the heart of fools \add is\add* in the house of mirth. 
\v 5  \add It is\add* better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a
man to hear the song of fools. 
\v 6  For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so \add is\add*
the laughter of the fool: this also \add is\add* vanity.\f + \fr 7.6 
\ft crackling: Heb. sound\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
the heart. 
\v 8  Better \add is\add* the end of a thing than the beginning thereof:
\add and\add* the patient in spirit \add is\add* better than the
proud in spirit. 
\v 9  Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools. 
\v 10  Say not thou, What is \add the cause\add* that the former
days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
this.\f + \fr 7.10  \ft wisely: Heb. out of wisdom\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Wisdom \add is\add* good with an inheritance: and \add by it there
is\add* profit to them that see the sun.\f + \fr 7.11  \ft good…: or, as good as an inheritance, yea, better
too\f* 
\v 12  For wisdom \add is\add* a defence, \add and\add* money \add is\add*
a defence: but the excellency of knowledge \add is, that\add* wisdom
giveth life to them that have it.\f + \fr 7.12  \ft defence: Heb.
shadow\f* 
\v 13  Consider the work of God: for who can make \add that\add*
straight, which he hath made crooked? 
\v 14  In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity
consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the
end that man should find nothing after him.\f + \fr 7.14  \ft set: Heb.
made\f* 
\v 15 All \add things\add* have I seen in the days of my vanity:
there is a just \add man\add* that perisheth in his righteousness,
and there is a wicked \add man\add* that prolongeth \add his life\add*
in his wickedness. 
\v 16  Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
why shouldest thou destroy thyself?\f + \fr 7.16  \ft destroy…: Heb. be
desolate?\f* 
\v 17  Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou
die before thy time?\f + \fr 7.17  \ft before…: Heb. not in thy time?\f*
\v 18  \add It is\add* good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from
this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come
forth of them all. 
\v 19  Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty \add men\add*
which are in the city. 
\v 20 For \add there is\add* not a just man upon earth, that doeth
good, and sinneth not. 
\v 21  Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
hear thy servant curse thee:\f + \fr 7.21  \ft take…: Heb. give not thine
heart\f* 
\v 22  For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast
cursed others. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it
\add was\add* far from me. 
\v 24  That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
out? 
\v 25  I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
wisdom, and the reason \add of things\add*, and to know the wickedness
of folly, even of foolishness \add and\add* madness:\f + \fr 7.25 
\ft I applied…: Heb. I and mine heart compassed\f* 
\v 26  And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart \add is\add*
snares and nets, \add and\add* her hands \add as\add* bands: whoso
pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by
her.\f + \fr 7.26  \ft whoso…: Heb. he that is good before God\f*
\v 27  Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, \add counting\add*
one by one, to find out the account:\f + \fr 7.27  \ft counting…: or, weighing one thing after another, to find out the
reason\f* 
\v 28  Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
\v 29  Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
but they have sought out many inventions. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Who \add is\add* as the wise \add man\add*? and who knoweth
the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to
shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.\f + \fr 8.1 
\ft the boldness: Heb. the strength\f* 
\v 2 I \add counsel thee\add* to keep the king’s commandment, and
\add that\add* in regard of the oath of God. 
\v 3  Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;
for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
\v 4  Where the word of a king \add is, there is\add* power: and who may
say unto him, What doest thou? 
\v 5  Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise
man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.\f + \fr 8.5  \ft shall…: Heb. shall
know\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
misery of man \add is\add* great upon him. 
\v 7  For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall
be?\f + \fr 8.7  \ft when…: or, how it shall be?\f* 
\v 8  \add There is\add* no man that hath power over the spirit to
retain the spirit; neither \add hath he\add* power in the day of
death: and \add there is\add* no discharge in \add that\add* war;
neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.\f + \fr 8.8 
\ft discharge: or, casting off weapons\f* 
\p
\v 9  All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
that is done under the sun: \add there is\add* a time wherein one
man ruleth over another to his own hurt. 
\v 10  And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so
done: this \add is\add* also vanity. 
\v 11  Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
evil. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his \add days\add*
be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that
fear God, which fear before him: 
\v 13  But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
prolong \add his\add* days, \add which are\add* as a shadow; because he
feareth not before God. 
\p
\v 14  There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
just \add men\add*, unto whom it happeneth according to the work
of the wicked; again, there be wicked \add men\add*, to whom it happeneth
according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also \add is\add*
vanity. 
\v 15  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall
abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth
him under the sun. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
business that is done upon the earth: (for also \add there is that\add*
neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 
\v 17  Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find
out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek
\add it\add* out, yet he shall not find \add it;\add* yea further; though a
wise \add man\add* think to know \add it\add*, yet shall he not be
able to find \add it\add*. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the
righteous, and the wise, and their works, \add are\add* in the hand
of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred \add by\add* all \add that
is\add* before them.\f + \fr 9.1  \ft I considered…: Heb. I gave, or, set to my
heart\f* 
\v 2 All \add things come\add* alike to all: \add there is\add* one
event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the
clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
sacrificeth not: as \add is\add* the good, so \add is\add* the sinner;
\add and\add* he that sweareth, as \add he\add* that feareth an oath.
\v 3 This \add is\add* an evil among all \add things\add* that are
done under the sun, that \add there is\add* one event unto all: yea, also the
heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness \add is\add*
in their heart while they live, and after that \add they go\add*
to the dead. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope:
for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 
\v 5  For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know
not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
of them is forgotten. 
\v 6  Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
neither have they any more a portion for ever in any \add thing\add*
that is done under the sun. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. 
\v 8  Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
ointment. 
\v 9  Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the
life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the
days of thy vanity: for that \add is\add* thy portion in \add this\add*
life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.\f + \fr 9.9 
\ft Live…: Heb. See, or, Enjoy life\f* 
\v 10  Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do \add it\add* with thy
might; for \add there is\add* no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race \add is\add*
not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread
to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. 
\v 12  For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare;
so \add are\add* the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
falleth suddenly upon them. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it \add seemed\add*
great unto me: 
\v 14  \add There was\add* a little city, and few men within it; and there
came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
\v 15  Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom
delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 
\v 16  Then said I, Wisdom \add is\add* better than strength: nevertheless the poor
man’s wisdom \add is\add* despised, and his words are not heard.
\v 17  The words of wise \add men are\add* heard in quiet more than the
cry of him that ruleth among fools. 
\v 18  Wisdom \add is\add* better than weapons of war: but one sinner
destroyeth much good. 
\c 10

\v 1  Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth

reputation for wisdom \add and\add* honour.\f + \fr 10.1  \ft Dead…: Heb. Flies of
death\f* 
\v 2  A wise man’s heart \add is\add* at his right hand; but a fool’s
heart at his left. 
\v 3  Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom

\v 4  If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy

\v 10  If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he

\v 16 ¶ Woe to thee, O land, when thy king \add is\add* a child,
and thy princes eat in the morning!

the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength,

\v 9 ¶ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
