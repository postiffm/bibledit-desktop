\mt1 THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  Paul, called \add to be\add* an apostle of Jesus Christ through
the will of God, and Sosthenes \add our\add* brother, 
\v 2  Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
sanctified in Christ Jesus, called \add to be\add* saints, with all that
in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both
theirs and ours: 
\v 3  Grace \add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father,
and \add from\add* the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\p
\v 4  I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God
which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
\v 5  That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
and \add in\add* all knowledge; 
\v 6  Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
\v 7  So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ: 
\v 8  Who shall also confirm you unto the end, \add that ye may be\add*
blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 9  God \add is\add* faithful, by whom ye were called unto the
fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
\p
\v 10  Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and \add that\add* there
be no divisions among you; but \add that\add* ye be perfectly joined
together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
\v 11  For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by
them \add which are of the house\add* of Chloe, that there are contentions
among you. 
\v 12  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul;
and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
\v 13  Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
baptized in the name of Paul? 
\v 14  I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
\v 15  Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
\v 16  And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I
know not whether I baptized any other. 
\v 17  For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:
not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none
effect. 
\p
\v 18  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
\v 19  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. 
\v 20  Where \add is\add* the wise? where \add is\add* the scribe?
where \add is\add* the disputer of this world? hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of this world? 
\v 21  For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
that believe. 
\v 22  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
\v 23  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness; 
\v 24  But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 
\v 25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God is stronger than men. 
\v 26  For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, \add are called\add*:
\v 27  But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound
the things which are mighty; 
\v 28  And base things of the world, and things which are despised,
hath God chosen, \add yea\add*, and things which are not, to bring to
nought things that are: 
\v 29  That no flesh should glory in his presence. 
\v 30  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
\v 31  That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
\v 2  For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
Christ, and him crucified. 
\v 3  And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\v 4  And my speech and my preaching \add was\add* not with enticing
words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
power: 
\v 5  That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but
in the power of God. 
\v 6  Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that
come to nought: 
\v 7  But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, \add even\add*
the hidden \add wisdom\add*, which God ordained before the world
unto our glory: 
\v 8  Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
known \add it\add*, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\v 9  But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him. 
\v 10  But God hath revealed \add them\add* unto us by his Spirit:
for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
\v 11  For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit
of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man,
but the Spirit of God. 
\v 12  Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely
given to us of God. 
\v 13  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
things with spiritual. 
\v 14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know \add them\add*,
because they are spiritually discerned. 
\v 15  But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself
is judged of no man. 
\v 16  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
him? But we have the mind of Christ. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
but as unto carnal, \add even\add* as unto babes in Christ. 
\v 2  I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not
able \add to bear it\add*, neither yet now are ye able. 
\p
\v 3  For ye are yet carnal: for whereas \add there is\add* among
you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk
as men? 
\v 4  For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I \add am\add*
of Apollos; are ye not carnal? 
\v 5  Who then is Paul, and who \add is\add* Apollos, but ministers
by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 
\v 6  I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
\v 7  So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 
\v 8  Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 
\v 9  For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry,
\add ye are\add* God’s building. 
\v 10  According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a
wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth
thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 
\v 11  For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
is Jesus Christ. 
\v 12  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
\v 13  Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare
it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try
every man’s work of what sort it is. 
\v 14  If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward. 
\v 15  If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 
\v 16  Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and \add that\add*
the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 
\v 17  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
for the temple of God is holy, which \add temple\add* ye are. 
\p
\v 18  Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to
be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
\v 19  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For
it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 
\v 20  And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
they are vain. 
\v 21  Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
\v 22  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life,
or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
\v 23  And ye are Christ’s; and Christ \add is\add* God’s. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Let a man so account  of us, as of the ministers of Christ,
and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
\v 2  Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
\v 3  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
\v 4  For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
\v 5  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make
manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have
praise of God. 
\v 6  And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred
to myself and \add to\add* Apollos for your sakes; that ye might
learn in us not to think \add of men\add* above that which is written,
that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. 
\v 7  For who maketh thee to differ \add from another\add*? and what
hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive
\add it\add*, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received
\add it\add*? 
\v 8  Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings
without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign
with you. 
\v 9  For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it
were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world,
and to angels, and to men. 
\v 10  We \add are\add* fools for Christ’s sake, but ye \add are\add*
wise in Christ; we \add are\add* weak, but ye \add are\add* strong;
ye \add are\add* honourable, but we \add are\add* despised. 
\v 11  Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 
\v 12  And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: 
\v 13  Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the
world, \add and are\add* the offscouring of all things unto this
day. 
\v 14  I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
I warn \add you\add*. 
\v 15  For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet
\add have ye\add* not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten
you through the gospel. 
\v 16  Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 
\v 17  For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance
of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
\v 18  Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
\v 19  But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will
know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
\v 20  For the kingdom of God \add is\add* not in word, but in power.
\v 21  What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love,
and \add in\add* the spirit of meekness? 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  It is reported commonly \add that there is\add* fornication
among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among
the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife. 
\v 2  And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath
done this deed might be taken away from among you. 
\v 3  For I verily, as absent  in body, but present in spirit, have
judged already, as though I were present, \add concerning\add* him
that hath so done this deed, 
\v 4  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 5  To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6  Your glorying \add is\add* not good. Know ye not that a little
leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
\v 7  Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,
as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed
for us: 
\v 8  Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened
\add bread\add* of sincerity and truth. 
\v 9  I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
\v 10  Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or
with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye
needs go out of the world. 
\v 11  But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an
one no not to eat. 
\v 12  For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?
do not ye judge them that are within? 
\v 13  But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away
from among yourselves that wicked person. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
before the unjust, and not before the saints? 
\v 2  Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if
the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest
matters? 
\v 3  Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this
life? 
\v 4  If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life,
set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 
\v 5  I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
\v 6  But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
unbelievers. 
\v 7  Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye
go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why
do ye not rather \add suffer yourselves to\add* be defrauded? 
\v 8  Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that \add your\add* brethren.
\v 9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom
of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
\v 10  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
\v 11  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit
of our God. 
\p
\v 12  All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient:
all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the
power of any. 
\v 13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
destroy both it and them. Now the body \add is\add* not for fornication,
but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. 
\v 14  And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise
up us by his own power. 
\v 15  Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall
I then take the members of Christ, and make \add them\add* the members
of an harlot? God forbid. 
\v 16  What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is
one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 
\v 17  But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
\v 18  Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the
body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own
body. 
\v 19  What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost \add which is\add* in you, which ye have of God, and ye are
not your own? 
\v 20  For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
body, and in your spirit, which are God’s. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: \add It
is\add* good for a man not to touch a woman. 
\v 2  Nevertheless, \add to avoid\add* fornication, let every man
have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 
\v 3  Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise
also the wife unto the husband. 
\v 4  The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the
wife. 
\v 5  Defraud ye not one the other, except \add it be\add* with consent
for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and
come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
\v 6  But I speak this by permission, \add and\add* not of commandment.
\v 7  For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man
hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after
that. 
\p
\v 8  I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for
them if they abide even as I. 
\v 9  But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
to marry than to burn. 
\v 10  And unto the married I command, \add yet\add* not I, but the
Lord, Let not the wife depart from \add her\add* husband: 
\v 11  But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled
to \add her\add* husband: and let not the husband put away \add his\add*
wife. 
\v 12  But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath
a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him,
let him not put her away. 
\v 13  And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and
if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
\v 14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
children unclean; but now are they holy. 
\v 15  But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or
a sister is not under bondage in such \add cases\add*: but God hath
called us to peace. 
\v 16  For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save \add thy\add*
husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save \add thy\add*
wife? 
\v 17  But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
\v 18  Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.
Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 
\v 19  Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but
the keeping of the commandments of God. 
\v 20  Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
\v 21  Art thou called \add being\add* a servant? care not for it:
but if thou mayest be made free, use \add it\add* rather. 
\v 22  For he that is called in the Lord, \add being\add* a servant,
is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, \add being\add*
free, is Christ’s servant. 
\v 23  Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
\v 24  Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide
with God. 
\p
\v 25  Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord:
yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord
to be faithful. 
\v 26  I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress,
\add I say\add*, that \add it is\add* good for a man so to be. 
\v 27  Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. 
\v 28  But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble
in the flesh: but I spare you. 
\v 29  But this I say, brethren, the time \add is\add* short: it
remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
\v 30  And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though
they possessed not; 
\v 31  And they that use this world, as not abusing \add it\add*:
for the fashion of this world passeth away. 
\v 32  But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please
the Lord: 
\v 33  But he that is married careth for the things that are of the
world, how he may please \add his\add* wife. 
\v 34  There is difference \add also\add* between a wife and a virgin.
The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may
be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth
for the things of the world, how she may please \add her\add* husband.
\v 35  And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast
a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend
upon the Lord without distraction. 
\v 36  But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward
his virgin, if she pass the flower of \add her\add* age, and need
so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
\v 37  Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having
no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed
in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 
\v 38  So then he that giveth \add her\add* in marriage doeth well;
but he that giveth \add her\add* not in marriage doeth better. 
\v 39  The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth;
but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom
she will; only in the Lord. 
\v 40  But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and
I think also that I have the Spirit of God. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we
all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 
\v 2  And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth
nothing yet as he ought to know. 
\v 3  But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 
\v 4  As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto
idols, we know that an idol \add is\add* nothing in the world, and
that \add there is\add* none other God but one. 
\v 5  For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven
or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 
\v 6  But to us \add there is but\add* one God, the Father, of whom
\add are\add* all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom \add are\add* all things, and we by him. 
\v 7  Howbeit \add there is\add* not in every man that knowledge:
for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat \add it\add*
as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak
is defiled. 
\v 8  But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat,
are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
\v 9  But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become
a stumblingblock to them that are weak. 
\v 10  For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in
the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak
be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 
\v 11  And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
whom Christ died? 
\v 12  But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
\v 13  Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no
flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
\v 2  If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you:
for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 
\v 3  Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 
\v 4  Have we not power to eat and to drink? 
\v 5  Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as
other apostles, and \add as\add* the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
\v 6  Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
\v 7  Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth
a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a
flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 
\v 8  Say I these things as a man? or saith  not the law the same
also? 
\v 9  For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth
of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
\v 10  Or saith he \add it\add* altogether for our sakes? For our
sakes, no doubt, \add this\add* is written: that he that ploweth
should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be
partaker of his hope. 
\v 11  If we have sown unto you spiritual things, \add is it\add*
a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? 
\v 12  If others be partakers of \add this\add* power over you, \add are\add*
not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer
all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
\v 13  Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things
live \add of the things\add* of the temple? and they which wait at the
altar are partakers with the altar? 
\v 14  Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the
gospel should live of the gospel. 
\v 15  But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
these things, that it should be so done unto me: for \add it were\add*
better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
\v 16  For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of:
for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not
the gospel! 
\v 17  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if
against my will, a dispensation \add of the gospel\add* is committed unto
me. 
\v 18  What is my reward then? \add Verily\add* that, when I preach the
gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse
not my power in the gospel. 
\v 19  For though I be free from all \add men\add*, yet have I made
myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. 
\v 20  And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might
gain them that are under the law; 
\v 21  To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without
law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without
law. 
\v 22  To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak:
I am made all things to all \add men\add*, that I might by all means
save some. 
\v 23  And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker
thereof with \add you\add*. 
\v 24  Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
\v 25  And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
things. Now they \add do it\add* to obtain a corruptible crown; but
we an incorruptible. 
\v 26  I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as
one that beateth the air: 
\v 27  But I keep under my body, and bring \add it\add* into subjection:
lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
should be a castaway. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through
the sea; 
\v 2  And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
\v 3  And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 
\v 4  And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank
of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
\v 5  But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
overthrown in the wilderness. 
\v 6  Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 
\v 7  Neither be ye idolaters, as \add were\add* some of them; as
it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up
to play. 
\v 8  Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed,
and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 
\v 9  Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted,
and were destroyed of serpents. 
\v 10  Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
destroyed of the destroyer. 
\v 11  Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world
are come. 
\v 12  Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
he fall. 
\v 13  There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
man: but God \add is\add* faithful, who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also
make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 14  Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 
\v 15  I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
\v 16  The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion
of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion
of the body of Christ? 
\v 17  For we \add being\add* many are one bread, \add and\add* one
body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. 
\v 18  Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
sacrifices partakers of the altar? 
\v 19  What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to
idols is any thing? 
\v 20  But I \add say\add*, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye
should have fellowship with devils. 
\v 21  Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils:
ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.
\v 22  Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
\v 23  All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:
all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. 
\v 24  Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s \add wealth\add*.
\v 25  Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, \add that\add* eat, asking
no question for conscience sake: 
\v 26  For the earth \add is\add* the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
\v 27  If any of them that believe not bid you \add to a feast\add*,
and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking
no question for conscience sake. 
\v 28  But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake:
for the earth \add is\add* the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof: 
\v 29  Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why
is my liberty judged of another \add man’s\add* conscience? 
\v 30  For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for
that for which I give thanks? 
\v 31  Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God. 
\v 32  Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles,
nor to the church of God: 
\v 33  Even as I please all \add men\add* in all \add things\add*,
not seeking mine own profit, but the \add profit\add* of many, that
they may be saved. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Be ye followers of me, even as I also \add am\add* of Christ.
\p
\v 2  Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
and keep the ordinances, as I delivered \add them\add* to you. 
\v 3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;
and the head of the woman \add is\add* the man; and the head of Christ
\add is\add* God. 
\v 4  Every man praying or prophesying, having \add his\add* head
covered, dishonoureth his head. 
\v 5  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth  with \add her\add*
head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as
if she were shaven. 
\v 6  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but
if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
\v 7  For a man indeed ought not to cover \add his\add* head, forasmuch as he
is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the
man. 
\v 8  For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
\v 9  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for
the man. 
\v 10  For this cause ought the woman to have power on \add her\add*
head because of the angels. 
\v 11  Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither
the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
\v 12  For as the woman \add is\add* of the man, even so \add is\add*
the man also by the woman; but all things of God. 
\v 13  Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
uncovered? 
\v 14  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long
hair, it is a shame unto him? 
\v 15  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for \add her\add*
hair is given her for a covering. 
\v 16  But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God. 
\p
\v 17  Now in this that I declare \add unto you\add* I praise \add you\add*
not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
\v 18  For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
\v 19  For there must be also heresies among you, that they which
are approved may be made manifest among you. 
\v 20  When ye come together therefore into one place, \add this\add*
is not to eat the Lord’s supper. 
\v 21  For in eating every one taketh before \add other\add* his
own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 
\v 22  What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise
ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I
say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise \add you\add* not.
\v 23  For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
unto you, That the Lord Jesus the \add same\add* night in which he was
betrayed took bread: 
\v 24  And when he had given thanks, he brake \add it\add*, and said,
\wj  Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do
in remembrance of me.\wj* 
\v 25  After the same manner also \add he took\add* the cup, when
he had supped, saying, \wj  This cup is the new testament in my blood:
this do ye, as oft as ye drink \+add it\+add*, in remembrance of
me.\wj* 
\v 26  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
shew the Lord’s death till he come. 
\v 27  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink \add this\add*
cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
of the Lord. 
\v 28  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of \add that\add*
bread, and drink of \add that\add* cup. 
\v 29  For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. 
\v 30  For this cause many \add are\add* weak and sickly among you,
and many sleep. 
\v 31  For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
\v 32  But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with the world. 
\v 33  Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry
one for another. 
\v 34  And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when
I come. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  Now concerning spiritual \add gifts\add*, brethren, I would
not have you ignorant. 
\v 2  Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
idols, even as ye were led. 
\v 3  Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and \add that\add* no man
can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 
\v 4  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
\v 5  And there are differences of administrations, but the same
Lord. 
\v 6  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
God which worketh all in all. 
\v 7  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
withal. 
\v 8  For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
\v 9  To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
healing by the same Spirit; 
\v 10  To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
another discerning of spirits; to another \add divers\add* kinds
of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: 
\v 11  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing
to every man severally as he will. 
\v 12  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also \add is\add*
Christ. 
\v 13  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
\add we be\add* Jews or Gentiles, whether \add we be\add* bond or
free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. 
\v 14  For the body is not one member, but many. 
\v 15  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not
of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
\v 16  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
\v 17  If the whole body \add were\add* an eye, where \add were\add*
the hearing? If the whole \add were\add* hearing, where \add were\add*
the smelling? 
\v 18  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
body, as it hath pleased him. 
\v 19  And if they were all one member, where \add were\add* the
body? 
\v 20  But now \add are they\add* many members, yet but one body.
\v 21  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
\v 22  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
more feeble, are necessary: 
\v 23  And those \add members\add* of the body, which we think to
be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and
our uncomely \add parts\add* have more abundant comeliness. 
\v 24  For our comely \add parts\add* have no need: but God hath
tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to
that \add part\add* which lacked: 
\v 25  That there should be no schism in the body; but \add that\add*
the members should have the same care one for another. 
\v 26  And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with
it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. 
\v 27  Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
\v 28  And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings,
helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 
\v 29  \add Are\add* all apostles? \add are\add* all prophets? \add are\add*
all teachers? \add are\add* all workers of miracles? 
\v 30  Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues?
do all interpret? 
\v 31  But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you
a more excellent way. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
not charity, I am become \add as\add* sounding brass, or a tinkling
cymbal. 
\v 2  And though I have \add the gift of\add* prophecy, and understand
all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
\v 3  And though I bestow all my goods to feed \add the poor\add*,
and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
me nothing. 
\v 4  Charity suffereth long, \add and\add* is kind; charity envieth
not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 
\v 5  Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 
\v 6  Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
\v 7  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things. 
\v 8  Charity never faileth: but whether \add there be\add* prophecies,
they shall fail; whether \add there be\add* tongues, they shall cease;
whether \add there be\add* knowledge, it shall vanish away. 
\v 9  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
\v 10  But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is
in part shall be done away. 
\v 11  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
childish things. 
\v 12  For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
\v 13  And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
greatest of these \add is\add* charity. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  Follow after charity, and desire spiritual \add gifts\add*,
but rather that ye may prophesy. 
\v 2  For he that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue speaketh
not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth \add him\add*;
howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
\v 3  But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men \add to\add* edification,
and exhortation, and comfort. 
\v 4  He that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue edifieth himself;
but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. 
\v 5  I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye
prophesied: for greater \add is\add* he that prophesieth than he
that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church
may receive edifying. 
\v 6  Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation,
or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 
\v 7  And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or
harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be
known what is piped or harped? 
\v 8  For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
himself to the battle? 
\v 9  So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to
be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
speak into the air. 
\v 10  There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,
and none of them \add is\add* without signification. 
\v 11  Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall
be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh \add shall
be\add* a barbarian unto me. 
\v 12  Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual \add gifts\add*,
seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. 
\v 13  Wherefore let him that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue
pray that he may interpret. 
\v 14  For if I pray in an \add unknown\add* tongue, my spirit prayeth,
but my understanding is unfruitful. 
\v 15  What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will
sing with the understanding also. 
\v 16  Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks,
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? 
\v 17  For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
\v 18  I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 
\v 19  Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding,
that \add by my voice\add* I might teach others also, than ten thousand
words in an \add unknown\add* tongue. 
\v 20  Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice
be ye children, but in understanding be men. 
\v 21  In the law it is written, With \add men of\add* other tongues
and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that
will they not hear me, saith the Lord. 
\v 22  Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,
but to them that believe not: but prophesying \add serveth\add* not
for them that believe not, but for them which believe. 
\v 23  If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
and all speak with tongues, and there come in \add those that are\add*
unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? 
\v 24  But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth
not, or \add one\add* unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged
of all: 
\v 25  And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so
falling down on \add his\add* face he will worship God, and report
that God is in you of a truth. 
\v 26  How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one
of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation,
hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
\v 27  If any man speak in an \add unknown\add* tongue, \add let it
be\add* by two, or at the most \add by\add* three, and \add that\add*
by course; and let one interpret. 
\v 28  But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
\v 29  Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
\v 30  If \add any thing\add* be revealed to another that sitteth
by, let the first hold his peace. 
\v 31  For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and
all may be comforted. 
\v 32  And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
\v 33  For God is not \add the author\add* of confusion, but of peace,
as in all churches of the saints. 
\v 34  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
permitted unto them to speak; but \add they are commanded\add* to be under
obedience, as also saith the law. 
\v 35  And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands
at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 
\v 36  What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
only? 
\v 37  If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him
acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments
of the Lord. 
\v 38  But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. 
\v 39  Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to
speak with tongues. 
\v 40  Let all things be done decently and in order. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
\v 2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
\v 3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
\v 4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
according to the scriptures: 
\v 5  And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
\v 6  After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;
of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen
asleep. 
\v 7  After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
\v 8  And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
time. 
\v 9  For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
\v 10  But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
\add was bestowed\add* upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more
abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was
with me. 
\v 11  Therefore whether \add it were\add* I or they, so we preach,
and so ye believed. 
\v 12  Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how
say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
\v 13  But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
not risen: 
\v 14  And if Christ be not risen, then \add is\add* our preaching
vain, and your faith \add is\add* also vain. 
\v 15  Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up,
if so be that the dead rise not. 
\v 16  For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 
\v 17  And if Christ be not raised, your faith \add is\add* vain;
ye are yet in your sins. 
\v 18  Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
\v 19  If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all
men most miserable. 
\v 20  But now is Christ risen from the dead, \add and\add* become
the firstfruits of them that slept. 
\v 21  For since by man \add came\add* death, by man \add came\add*
also the resurrection of the dead. 
\v 22  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive. 
\v 23  But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward
they that are Christ’s at his coming. 
\v 24  Then \add cometh\add* the end, when he shall have delivered
up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down
all rule and all authority and power. 
\v 25  For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
feet. 
\v 26  The last enemy \add that\add* shall be destroyed \add is\add*
death. 
\v 27  For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
all things are put under \add him, it is\add* manifest that he is
excepted, which did put all things under him. 
\v 28  And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall
the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under
him, that God may be all in all. 
\v 29  Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if
the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
\v 30  And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 
\v 31  I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our
Lord, I die daily. 
\v 32  If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink;
for to morrow we die. 
\v 33  Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
\v 34  Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
knowledge of God: I speak \add this\add* to your shame. 
\p
\v 35  But some \add man\add* will say, How are the dead raised up?
and with what body do they come? 
\v 36  \add Thou\add* fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
except it die: 
\v 37  And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other
\add grain\add*: 
\v 38  But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
seed his own body. 
\v 39  All flesh \add is\add* not the same flesh: but \add there
is\add* one \add kind of\add* flesh of men, another flesh of beasts,
another of fishes, \add and\add* another of birds. 
\v 40  \add There are\add* also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial:
but the glory of the celestial \add is\add* one, and the \add glory\add*
of the terrestrial \add is\add* another. 
\v 41  \add There is\add* one glory of the sun, and another glory
of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for \add one\add* star
differeth from \add another\add* star in glory. 
\v 42  So also \add is\add* the resurrection of the dead. It is sown
in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 
\v 43  It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown
in weakness; it is raised in power: 
\v 44  It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
\v 45  And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
soul; the last Adam \add was made\add* a quickening spirit. 
\v 46  Howbeit that \add was\add* not first which is spiritual, but
that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. 
\v 47  The first man \add is\add* of the earth, earthy: the second
man \add is\add* the Lord from heaven. 
\v 48  As \add is\add* the earthy, such \add are\add* they also that are
earthy: and as \add is\add* the heavenly, such \add are\add* they
also that are heavenly. 
\v 49  And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly. 
\v 50  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
\v 51  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but
we shall all be changed, 
\v 52  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. 
\v 53  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
\add must\add* put on immortality. 
\v 54  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
\v 55  O death, where \add is\add* thy sting? O grave, where \add is\add*
thy victory? 
\v 56  The sting of death \add is\add* sin; and the strength of sin
\add is\add* the law. 
\v 57  But thanks \add be\add* to God, which giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 58  Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that
your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

\v 1  Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
\v 2  Upon the first \add day\add* of the week let every one of you
lay by him in store, as \add God\add* hath prospered him, that there
be no gatherings when I come. 
\v 3  And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by \add your\add*
letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
\v 4  And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 
\v 5  Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
for I do pass through Macedonia. 
\v 6  And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you,
that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 
\v 7  For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry
a while with you, if the Lord permit. 
\v 8  But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
\v 9  For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and \add there
are\add* many adversaries. 
\v 10  Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without
fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also \add do\add*.
\v 11  Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
\v 12  As touching \add our\add* brother Apollos, I greatly desired
him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all
to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient
time. 
\v 13  Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
\v 14  Let all your things be done with charity. 
\v 15  I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas,
that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and \add that\add* they have
addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 
\v 16  That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that
helpeth with \add us\add*, and laboureth. 
\v 17  I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus:
for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 
\v 18  For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge
ye them that are such. 
\p
\v 19  The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute
you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
\v 20  All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy
kiss. 
\v 21  The salutation of \add me\add* Paul with mine own hand. 
\v 22  If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
Maranatha. 
\v 23  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you.
\v 24  My love \add be\add* with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. 
\s1 The first \add epistle\add* to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and
Timotheus.
