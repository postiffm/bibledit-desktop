\v 1 O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed;
\v 2 who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof;
\v 3 who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and
glorious name; 
\v 4 whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening
toward sinners is importable: 
\v 5 but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 
\v 6 for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men.
Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee:
and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved.
\v 7 Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner:
\v 8 for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions
are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities.
\v 9 I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release: for I have provoked thy
wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have
multiplied offences. 
\v 10 Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace.
\v 11 I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:
\v 12 wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry
with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the
God of them that repent; 
\v 13 and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy.
\v 14 Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and
thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
