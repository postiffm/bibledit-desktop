\v 1  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth \add month\add*,
in the fifth \add day\add* of the month, as I \add was\add* among
the captives by the river of Chebar, \add that\add* the heavens were
opened, and I saw visions of God.\f + \fr 1.1  \ft captives: Heb.
captivity\f* 
\v 2  In the fifth \add day\add* of the month, which \add was\add*
the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
\v 3  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came expressly unto Ezekiel the
priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river
Chebar; and the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was there upon him.\f + \fr 1.3 
\ft Ezekiel: Heb. Jehezkel\f* 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness \add was\add*
about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the
midst of the fire.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft infolding…: Heb. catching itself\f*
\v 5  Also out of the midst thereof \add came\add* the likeness of
four living creatures. And this \add was\add* their appearance; they
had the likeness of a man. 
\v 6  And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
\v 7  And their feet \add were\add* straight feet; and the sole of their
feet \add was\add* like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled
like the colour of burnished brass.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft straight…: Heb. a straight
foot\f* 
\v 8 And \add they had\add* the hands of a man under their wings
on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
\v 9  Their wings \add were\add* joined one to another; they turned
not when they went; they went every one straight forward. 
\v 10  As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face
of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four
had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face
of an eagle. 
\v 11 Thus \add were\add* their faces: and their wings \add were\add*
stretched upward; two \add wings\add* of every one \add were\add*
joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.\f + \fr 1.11 
\ft stretched…: or, divided above\f* 
\v 12  And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit
was to go, they went; \add and\add* they turned not when they went.
\v 13  As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
\add was\add* like burning coals of fire, \add and\add* like the
appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures;
and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\v 14  And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance
of a flash of lightning. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the
earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 
\v 16  The appearance of the wheels and their work \add was\add*
like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness:
and their appearance and their work \add was\add* as it were a wheel
in the middle of a wheel. 
\v 17  When they went, they went upon their four sides: \add and\add*
they turned not when they went. 
\v 18  As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
and their rings \add were\add* full of eyes round about them four.\f + \fr 1.18 
\ft and their rings: or, and their strakes\f* 
\v 19  And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them:
and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the
wheels were lifted up. 
\v 20  Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither \add was
their\add* spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against
them: for the spirit of the living creature \add was\add* in the
wheels.\f + \fr 1.20  \ft of…: or, of life\f* 
\v 21  When those went, \add these\add* went; and when those stood,
\add these\add* stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth,
the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living
creature \add was\add* in the wheels.\f + \fr 1.21  \ft of…: or, of
life\f* 
\v 22  And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature \add was\add* as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched
forth over their heads above. 
\v 23  And under the firmament \add were\add* their wings straight,
the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this
side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
\v 24  And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the
noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of
speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their
wings. 
\v 25  And there was a voice from the firmament that \add was\add*
over their heads, when they stood, \add and\add* had let down their
wings. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And above the firmament that \add was\add* over their heads
\add was\add* the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire
stone: and upon the likeness of the throne \add was\add* the likeness
as the appearance of a man above upon it. 
\v 27  And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire
round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward,
and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the
appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. 
\v 28  As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day
of rain, so \add was\add* the appearance of the brightness round
about. This \add was\add* the appearance of the likeness of the glory
of the \nd LORD\nd*. And when I saw \add it\add*, I fell upon my
face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will
speak unto thee. 
\v 2  And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set
me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. 
\v 3  And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children
of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their
fathers have transgressed against me, \add even\add* unto this very
day.\f + \fr 2.3  \ft nation: Heb. nations\f* 
\v 4 For \add they are\add* impudent children and stiffhearted. I do
send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
Lord \nd GOD\nd*.\f + \fr 2.4  \ft impudent: Heb. hard of face\f*
\v 5  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they
\add are\add* a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a
prophet among them. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid
of their words, though briers and thorns \add be\add* with thee, and thou dost
dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed
at their looks, though they \add be\add* a rebellious house.\f + \fr 2.6 
\ft briers…: or, rebels\f* 
\v 7  And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will
hear, or whether they will forbear: for they \add are\add* most rebellious.\f + \fr 2.7 
\ft most…: Heb. rebellion\f* 
\v 8  But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I
give thee. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And when I looked, behold, an hand \add was\add* sent unto me; and, lo, a
roll of a book \add was\add* therein; 
\v 10  And he spread it before me; and it \add was\add* written within
and without: and \add there was\add* written therein lamentations,
and mourning, and woe. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;
eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 
\v 2  So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 
\v 3  And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and
fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat \add it;\add*
and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house
of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
\v 5 For thou \add art\add* not sent to a people of a strange speech
and of an hard language, \add but\add* to the house of Israel;\f + \fr 3.5 
\ft of a…: Heb. deep of lip, and heavy of tongue\f* 
\v 6  Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language,
whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have
hearkened unto thee.\f + \fr 3.6  \ft of a…: Heb. deep of lip, and heavy of
language\f*\f + \fr 3.6  \ft Surely…: or, If I had sent thee, etc. would they not have hearkened unto
thee?\f* 
\v 7  But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they
will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel \add are\add*
impudent and hardhearted.\f + \fr 3.7  \ft impudent…: Heb. stiff of forehead, and hard of
heart\f* 
\v 8  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy
forehead strong against their foreheads. 
\v 9  As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they \add be\add*
a rebellious house. 
\v 10  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall
speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.
\v 11  And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children
of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the
Lord \nd GOD\nd*; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
\v 12  Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice
of a great rushing, \add saying\add*, Blessed \add be\add* the glory
of the \nd LORD\nd* from his place. 
\v 13  \add I heard\add* also the noise of the wings of the living
creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over
against them, and a noise of a great rushing.\f + \fr 3.13  \ft touched: Heb.
kissed\f* 
\v 14  So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*
was strong upon me.\f + \fr 3.14  \ft in bitterness: Heb. bitter\f*\f + \fr 3.14 
\ft heat: Heb. hot anger\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt
by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there
astonished among them seven days. 
\p
\v 16  And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word
of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 17  Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\v 18  When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not
warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his
life; the same wicked \add man\add* shall die in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at thine hand. 
\v 19  Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,
nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
delivered thy soul. 
\v 20  Again, When a righteous \add man\add* doth turn from his righteousness,
and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall
die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his
sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered;
but his blood will I require at thine hand.\f + \fr 3.20  \ft righteousness which: Heb.
righteousnesses\f* 
\v 21  Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous \add man\add*, that the
righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is
warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was there upon me; and he
said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
\v 23  Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the
glory of the \nd LORD\nd* stood there, as the glory which I saw by the
river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. 
\v 24  Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet,
and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine
house. 
\v 25  But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall
bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
\v 26  And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,
that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they
\add are\add* a rebellious house.\f + \fr 3.26  \ft a reprover: Heb. a man
reproving\f* 
\v 27  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; He that heareth,
let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they \add are\add*
a rebellious house. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before
thee, and pourtray upon it the city, \add even\add* Jerusalem: 
\v 2  And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and
cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set \add battering\add*
rams against it round about.\f + \fr 4.2  \ft battering…: chief leaders\f*
\v 3  Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it \add for\add*
a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be
besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This \add shall be\add*
a sign to the house of Israel.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft an…: or, a flat plate, or,
slice\f* 
\v 4  Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the
house of Israel upon it: \add according\add* to the number of the
days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
\v 5  For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the
number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou
bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
\v 6  And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right
side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty
days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.\f + \fr 4.6  \ft each…: Heb. a day for a year, a day for a
year\f* 
\v 7  Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,
and thine arm \add shall be\add* uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
\v 8  And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not
turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days
of thy siege.\f + \fr 4.8  \ft from one…: Heb. from thy side to thy
side\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and
make thee bread thereof, \add according\add* to the number of the
days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety
days shalt thou eat thereof.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft fitches: or, spelt\f*
\v 10  And thy meat which thou shalt eat \add shall be\add* by weight,
twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. 
\v 11  Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an
hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. 
\v 12  And thou shalt eat it \add as\add* barley cakes, and thou shalt
bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Even thus shall the children of
Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will
drive them. 
\v 14  Then said I, Ah Lord \nd GOD\nd*! behold, my soul hath not been
polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of
itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh
into my mouth. 
\v 15  Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung  for
man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. 
\v 16  Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break
the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight,
and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:
\v 17  That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with
another, and consume away for their iniquity. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
barber’s razor, and cause \add it\add* to pass upon thine head and upon thy
beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the \add hair\add*.
\v 2  Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the
city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take
a third part, \add and\add* smite about it with a knife: and a third
part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword
after them. 
\v 3  Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy
skirts.\f + \fr 5.3  \ft skirts: Heb. wings\f* 
\v 4  Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the
fire, and burn them in the fire; \add for\add* thereof shall a fire
come forth into all the house of Israel. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; This \add is\add* Jerusalem:
I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries \add that
are\add* round about her. 
\v 6  And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the
nations, and my statutes more than the countries that \add are\add*
round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes,
they have not walked in them. 
\v 7  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because ye multiplied
more than the nations that \add are\add* round about you, \add and\add*
have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have
done according to the judgments of the nations that \add are\add*
round about you; 
\v 8  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I, even I,
\add am\add* against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst
of thee in the sight of the nations. 
\v 9  And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not
do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 
\v 10  Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the
sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole
remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. 
\v 11 Wherefore, \add as\add* I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*;
Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable
things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish
\add thee;\add* neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any
pity. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part
shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third
part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
\v 13  Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my
fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know
that I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken \add it\add* in my zeal, when I have
accomplished my fury in them. 
\v 14  Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the
nations that \add are\add* round about thee, in the sight of all that pass
by. 
\v 15  So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
astonishment unto the nations that \add are\add* round about thee, when I shall
execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.
I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken \add it\add*. 
\v 16  When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for
\add their\add* destruction, \add and\add* which I will send to destroy
you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your
staff of bread: 
\v 17  So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall
bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will
bring the sword upon thee. I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken \add it\add*.
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and
prophesy against them, 
\v 3  And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*; Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* to the mountains, and to the
hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, \add even\add*
I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
\v 4  And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
broken: and I will cast down your slain \add men\add* before your
idols.\f + \fr 6.4  \ft images: or, sun images\f* 
\v 5  And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel
before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your
altars.\f + \fr 6.5  \ft lay: Heb. give\f* 
\v 6  In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste,
and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid
waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease,
and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.\f + \fr 6.6 
\ft images: or, sun images\f* 
\v 7  And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have \add some\add*
that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered
through the countries. 
\v 9  And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations
whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their
whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes,
which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves
for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
\v 10  And they shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add and that\add* I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Smite with thine hand, and
stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations
of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence. 
\v 12  He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is
near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged
shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
\v 13  Then shall ye know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when their
slain \add men\add* shall be among their idols round about their
altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every
green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer
sweet savour to all their idols. 
\v 14  So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land
desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath,
in all their habitations: and they shall know that I \add am\add*
the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 6.14  \ft more…: or, desolate from the
wilderness\f* 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
\v 2  Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* unto the
land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the
land. 
\v 3 Now \add is\add* the end \add come\add* upon thee, and I will
send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways,
and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.\f + \fr 7.3 
\ft recompense: Heb. give\f* 
\v 4  And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity:
but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations
shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I \add am\add*
the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 5  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; An evil, an only evil, behold, is
come. 
\v 6  An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is
come.\f + \fr 7.6  \ft watcheth for: Heb. awaketh against\f* 
\v 7  The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the
land: the time is come, the day of trouble \add is\add* near, and not the sounding
again of the mountains.\f + \fr 7.7  \ft sounding…: or, echo\f* 
\v 8  Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish
mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways,
and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. 
\v 9  And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations \add that\add*
are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the
\nd LORD\nd* that smiteth.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft thee according: Heb. upon thee,
etc\f* 
\v 10  Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. 
\v 11  Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them
\add shall remain\add*, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither
\add shall there be\add* wailing for them.\f + \fr 7.11  \ft theirs: or, their tumultuous persons: Heb.

\v 12  The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath \add is\add* upon all the
multitude thereof. 
\v 13  For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet
alive: for the vision \add is\add* touching the whole multitude thereof,
\add which\add* shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the
iniquity of his life.\f + \fr 7.13  \ft although they…: Heb. though their life were yet among the

\v 14  They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
goeth to the battle: for my wrath \add is\add* upon all the multitude thereof.
\v 15  The sword \add is\add* without, and the pestilence and the
famine within: he that \add is\add* in the field shall die with the
sword; and he that \add is\add* in the city, famine and pestilence
shall devour him. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the

\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth \add month\add*,
in the fifth \add day\add* of the month, \add as\add* I sat in mine
house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the
Lord \nd GOD\nd* fell there upon me. 
\v 2  Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his
loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour
of amber. 
\v 3  And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock
of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the
heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the
door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where \add was\add*
the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. 
\v 4  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel \add was\add* there, according to the
vision that I saw in the plain. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the
way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the
north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of
jealousy in the entry. 
\v 6  He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they
do? \add even\add* the great abominations that the house of Israel
committeth  here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but
turn thee yet again, \add and\add* thou shalt see greater abominations.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
behold a hole in the wall. 
\v 8  Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had
digged in the wall, behold a door. 
\v 9  And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
that they do here. 
\v 10  So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,
and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel,
pourtrayed upon the wall round about. 
\v 11  And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son
of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud
of incense went up. 
\v 12  Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the
chambers of his imagery? for they say, The \nd LORD\nd* seeth us not; the
\nd LORD\nd* hath forsaken the earth. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, \add and\add*
thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. 
\v 14  Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the \nd LORD’s\nd*
house which \add was\add* toward the north; and, behold, there sat
women weeping for Tammuz. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen \add this\add*, O son
of man? turn thee yet again, \add and\add* thou shalt see greater
abominations than these. 
\v 16  And he brought me into the inner court of the \nd LORD’s\nd*
house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the \nd LORD\nd*,
between the porch and the altar, \add were\add* about five and twenty
men, with their backs toward the temple of the \nd LORD\nd*, and their
faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen \add this\add*, O son
of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit
the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the
land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they
put the branch to their nose.\f + \fr 8.17  \ft Is it…: or, Is there any thing lighter than to
commit\f* 
\v 18  Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a

\c 9  
\p
\v 1  He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have
charge over the city to draw near, even every man \add with\add*
his destroying weapon in his hand. 
\v 2  And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate,
which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his
hand; and one man among them \add was\add* clothed with linen, with a

\v 3  And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the
man clothed with linen, which \add had\add* the writer’s inkhorn
by his side; 
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Go through the midst of the
city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads
of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be
done in the midst thereof.\f + \fr 9.4  \ft set a mark: Heb. mark a

\p
\v 5 ¶ And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the

\ft mine hearing: Heb. mine ears\f* 
\v 6  Slay utterly old \add and\add* young, both maids, and little

men which \add were\add* before the house.\f + \fr 9.6  \ft utterly: Heb. to

\v 7  And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts
with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the
city. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was
left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord \nd GOD\nd*!
wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy
fury upon Jerusalem? 
\v 9  Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
Judah \add is\add* exceeding great, and the land is full of blood,
and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The \nd LORD\nd*
hath forsaken the earth, and the \nd LORD\nd* seeth not.\f + \fr 9.9 
\ft full of blood: Heb. filled with, etc\f*\f + \fr 9.9  \ft perverseness: or, wresting of

\v 10  And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have
pity, \add but\add* I will recompense their way upon their head.
\v 11  And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which \add had\add*
the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done
as thou hast commanded me.\f + \fr 9.11  \ft reported…: Heb. returned the
word\f* 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the
head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire
stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
\v 2  And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go
in between the wheels, \add even\add* under the cherub, and fill
thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter
\add them\add* over the city. And he went in in my sight.\f + \fr 10.2 
\ft thine hand: Heb. the hollow of thine hand\f* 
\v 3  Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the
man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
\v 4  Then the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* went up from the cherub,
\add and stood\add* over the threshold of the house; and the house
was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness
of the \nd LORD’s\nd* glory.\f + \fr 10.4  \ft went up: Heb. was lifted
up\f* 
\v 5  And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard \add even\add*
to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
\v 6 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when he had commanded the
man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels,
from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the
wheels. 
\v 7 And \add one\add* cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
cherubims unto the fire that \add was\add* between the cherubims,
and took \add thereof\add*, and put \add it\add* into the hands of

\p
\v 8 ¶ And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand
under their wings. 
\v 9  And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims,
one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the
appearance of the wheels \add was\add* as the colour of a beryl stone.
\v 10 And \add as for\add* their appearances, they four had one likeness,
as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 
\v 11  When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed
it; they turned not as they went. 
\v 12  And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
wings, and the wheels, \add were\add* full of eyes round about, \add even\add*
the wheels that they four had.\f + \fr 10.12  \ft body: Heb. flesh\f*
\v 13  As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O

\v 14  And every one had four faces: the first face \add was\add*
the face of a cherub, and the second face \add was\add* the face
of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face
of an eagle. 
\v 15  And the cherubims were lifted up. This \add is\add* the living
creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. 
\v 16  And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the
cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same
wheels also turned not from beside them. 
\v 17  When they stood, \add these\add* stood; and when they were lifted
up, \add these\add* lifted up themselves \add also:\add* for the

\ft of…: or, of life\f* 
\v 18  Then the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* departed from off the threshold
of the house, and stood over the cherubims. 
\v 19  And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also \add were\add*
beside them, and \add every one\add* stood at the door of the east
gate of the \nd LORD’s\nd* house; and the glory of the God of Israel
\add was\add* over them above. 
\v 20 This \add is\add* the living creature that I saw under the
God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they \add were\add*
the cherubims. 
\v 21  Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings;
and the likeness of the hands of a man \add was\add* under their
wings. 
\v 22  And the likeness of their faces \add was\add* the same faces
which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they
went every one straight forward. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
gate of the \nd LORD’s\nd* house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the
door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah
the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the
people. 
\v 2  Then said he unto me, Son of man, these \add are\add* the men
that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 
\v 3  Which say, \add It is\add* not near; let us build houses: this

\v 4 ¶ Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. 
\v 5  And the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* fell upon me, and said unto me,
Speak; Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Thus have ye said, O house of

\v 8  Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,

\v 11 This \add city\add* shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the

\v 12  And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: for ye have not

\p
\v 13 ¶ And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the
son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a
loud voice, and said, Ah Lord \nd GOD\nd*! wilt thou make a full
end of the remnant of Israel? 
\p
\v 14  Again the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 15  Son of man, thy brethren, \add even\add* thy brethren, the

from the \nd LORD\nd*: unto us is this land given in possession.
\v 16  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Although I have cast them far
off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the
countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries
where they shall come. 
\v 17  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will even
gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries
where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
\v 18  And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable
things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 
\v 19  And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will
give them an heart of flesh: 
\v 20  That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\v 21 But \add as for them\add* whose heart walketh after the heart
of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense
their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel \add was\add* over them
above. 
\v 23  And the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* went up from the midst of the
city, and stood upon the mountain which \add is\add* on the east
side of the city. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision
by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the

\v 25  Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the

\c 12  
\p
\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* also came unto me, saying,

\v 3  Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing,

\v 7  And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by

\v 14  And I will scatter toward every wind all that \add are\add*

\v 15  And they shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*,

\v 16  But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the

\v 23  Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will make this

but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every

\v 25 For I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: I will speak, and the

O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend \add it\add*.
\v 12  Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where
\add is\add* the daubing wherewith ye have daubed \add it\add*? 
\v 13  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will even rend
\add it\add* with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an

\v 14  So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered
\add morter\add*, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation
thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed
in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 15  Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have
daubed it with untempered \add morter\add*, and will say unto you, The

\v 16  \add To wit\add*, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and \add there

\p
\v 17 ¶ Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters
of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
\v 18  And say, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Woe to the \add women\add*
that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head
of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people,

\ft armholes: or, elbows\f* 
\v 19  And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley
and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to

that hear \add your\add* lies? 
\v 20  Wherefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I \add am\add*
against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make \add them\add*
fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls
go, \add even\add* the souls that ye hunt to make \add them\add*

\v 21  Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your

know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous
sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the
wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him
life:\f + \fr 13.22  \ft by…: or, that I should save his life: Heb. by quickening

\v 23  Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I
\add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat
before me. 
\v 2  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 3  Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be
enquired of at all by them? 
\v 4  Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the
Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up
his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity
before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the \nd LORD\nd* will
answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols; 
\v 5  That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all
estranged from me through their idols. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*; Repent, and turn \add yourselves\add* from your idols;
and turn away your faces from all your abominations.\f + \fr 14.6 
\ft yourselves: or, others\f* 
\v 7  For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth
up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his
iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the
\nd LORD\nd* will answer him by myself: 
\v 8  And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a
sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people;
and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing,
I the \nd LORD\nd* have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch
out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people
Israel. 
\v 10  And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that
seeketh \add unto him;\add* 
\v 11  That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be
polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my
people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came again to me, saying, 
\v 13  Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing
grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break
the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut
off man and beast from it: 
\v 14  Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
they should deliver \add but\add* their own souls by their righteousness,
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because
of the beasts:\f + \fr 14.15  \ft spoil: or, bereave\f* 
\v 16  \add Though\add* these three men \add were\add* in it, \add as\add*

nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be

\p
\v 17 ¶ Or \add if\add* I bring a sword upon that land, and say,
Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
\v 18  Though these three men \add were\add* in it, \add as\add*
I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, they shall deliver neither sons
nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Or \add if\add* I send a pestilence into that land, and pour
out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 
\v 20  Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, \add were\add* in it, \add as\add*
I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, they shall deliver neither son
nor daughter; they shall \add but\add* deliver their own souls by their

\v 21  For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; How much more when I
send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine,
and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man
and beast?\f + \fr 14.21  \ft How…: or, Also when\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought
forth, \add both\add* sons and daughters: behold, they shall come
forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be
comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem,
\add even\add* concerning all that I have brought upon it. 
\v 23  And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have
done in it, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, \add or
than\add* a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
\v 3  Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will \add men\add*
take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
\v 4  Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for

\v 5  Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be
meet yet for \add any\add* work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is
burned?\f + \fr 15.5  \ft meet: Heb. made fit\f* 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; As the vine tree
among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for
fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 7  And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from
\add one\add* fire, and \add another\add* fire shall devour them; and ye shall
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when I set my face against them.
\v 8  And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
a trespass, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*.\f + \fr 15.8  \ft committed…: Heb. trespassed a

\c 16  
\p
\v 1  Again the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 
\v 3  And say, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* unto Jerusalem; Thy
birth and thy nativity \add is\add* of the land of Canaan; thy father
\add was\add* an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.\f + \fr 16.3 
\ft birth: Heb. cutting out, or, habitation\f* 
\v 4 And \add as for\add* thy nativity, in the day thou wast born
thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple

\ft to supple…: or, when I looked upon thee\f* 
\v 5  None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the
lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
blood, I said unto thee \add when thou wast\add* in thy blood, Live;
yea, I said unto thee \add when thou wast\add* in thy blood, Live.\f + \fr 16.6 
\ft polluted: or, trodden under foot\f* 
\v 7  I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast

\v 8  Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy
time \add was\add* the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and
covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a
covenant with thee, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, and thou becamest mine.
\v 9  Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away
thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.\f + \fr 16.9 
\ft blood: Heb. bloods\f* 
\v 10  I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’
skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with
silk. 
\v 11  I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
hands, and a chain on thy neck. 
\v 12  And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
and a beautiful crown upon thine head.\f + \fr 16.12  \ft forehead: Heb.

\v 13  Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment
\add was of\add* fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst
eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful,
and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. 
\v 14  And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it
\add was\add* perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee,
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed
by; his it was. 
\v 16  And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: \add the like
things\add* shall not come, neither shall it be \add so\add*. 
\v 17  Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my

and didst commit whoredom with them,\f + \fr 16.17  \ft of men: Heb. of a

\v 18  And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast

\v 19  My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
\add wherewith\add* I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a

\ft a sweet…: Heb. a savour of rest\f* 
\v 20  Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast
borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured.
\add Is this\add* of thy whoredoms a small matter,\f + \fr 16.20 
\ft to be…: Heb. to devour\f* 
\v 21  That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass
through \add the fire\add* for them? 
\v 22  And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare,
\add and\add* wast polluted in thy blood. 
\v 23  And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee!
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*;) 
\v 24  \add That\add* thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place,
and hast made thee an high place in every street.\f + \fr 16.24 
\ft eminent…: or, brothel house\f* 
\v 25  Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy
beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed
by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. 
\v 26  Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to
anger. 
\v 27  Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have
diminished thine ordinary \add food\add*, and delivered thee unto the
will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are
ashamed of thy lewd way.\f + \fr 16.27  \ft daughters: or, cities\f*
\v 28  Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because
thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be
satisfied. 
\v 29  Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land
of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
\v 30  How weak is thine heart, saith  the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, seeing thou
doest all these \add things\add*, the work of an imperious whorish
 woman; 
\v 31  In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every
way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an
harlot, in that thou scornest hire;\f + \fr 16.31  \ft In that thou buildest…: or, In thy daughters is thine,

\v 32  \add But as\add* a wife that committeth adultery, \add which\add*
taketh strangers instead of her husband! 
\v 33  They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy
lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side
for thy whoredom.\f + \fr 16.33  \ft hirest: Heb. bribest\f* 
\v 34  And the contrary is in thee from \add other\add* women in thy

givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou
art contrary. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 36  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because thy filthiness was poured
out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy
lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood
of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; 
\v 37  Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken
pleasure, and all \add them\add* that thou hast loved, with all \add them\add*
that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will
discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
\v 38  And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.\f + \fr 16.38 
\ft as: Heb. with judgments of\f* 
\v 39  And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw

\v 40  They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall

\v 41  And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments
upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease
from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
\v 42  So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more
angry. 
\v 43  Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
fretted me in all these \add things;\add* behold, therefore I also will
recompense thy way upon \add thine\add* head, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*:
and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
\p
\v 44 ¶ Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use \add this\add*
proverb against thee, saying, As \add is\add* the mother, \add so
is\add* her daughter. 
\v 45 Thou \add art\add* thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her
husband and her children; and thou \add art\add* the sister of thy
sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother
\add was\add* an Hittite, and your father an Amorite. 
\v 46  And thine elder sister \add is\add* Samaria, she and her daughters
that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth

\v 49  Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\v 50  And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them
away as I saw \add good\add*. 
\v 51  Neither hath Samaria committed  half of thy sins; but thou hast
multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified
thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. 
\v 52  Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they:
they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and
bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. 
\v 53  When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of
Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then
\add will I bring again\add* the captivity of thy captives in the

\v 54  That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded
in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
\v 55  When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former
estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former

\v 56  For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the

\v 59  For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will even deal with thee as thou hast
done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 
\p
\v 60 ¶ Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the
days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting
covenant. 
\v 61  Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt
receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give
them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 
\v 62  And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 63  That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open

\c 17  
\p
\v 1  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the

\v 3  And say, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; A great eagle with

came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:\f + \fr 17.3 
\ft divers…: Heb. embroidering\f* 
\v 4  He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a

\v 5  He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful
field; he placed \add it\add* by great waters, \add and\add* set it
\add as\add* a willow tree.\f + \fr 17.5  \ft planted…: Heb. put it in a field of

\v 6  And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose

vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. 
\v 7  There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot
forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows
of her plantation. 
\v 8  It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring
forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a

\p
\v 11 ¶ Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
\v 12  Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these \add things

\v 15  But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he
prosper? shall he escape that doeth such \add things\add*? or shall he
break the covenant, and be delivered? 
\v 16  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, surely in the
place \add where\add* the king \add dwelleth\add* that made him king,
whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, \add even\add*

\v 17  Neither shall Pharaoh with \add his\add* mighty army and great

\v 18  Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had

\v 19  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; \add As\add* I

\v 21  And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the

and ye shall know that I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken \add it\add*.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will also take of the highest

\v 24  And all the trees of the field shall know that I the \nd LORD\nd*
have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have
dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish:
I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken and have done \add it\add*. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me again, saying, 
\v 2  What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land
of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s
teeth are set on edge? 
\v 3  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, ye shall not have
\add occasion\add* any more to use this proverb in Israel. 
\v 4  Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the
soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,\f + \fr 18.5 
\ft that…: Heb. judgment and justice\f* 
\v 6  \add And\add* hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted
up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled
his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,
\v 7  And hath not oppressed any, \add but\add* hath restored to the
debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his
bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 
\v 8 He \add that\add* hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath

hath executed true judgment between man and man, 
\v 9  Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to
deal truly; he \add is\add* just, he shall surely live, saith the
Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ If he beget a son \add that is\add* a robber, a shedder of

\v 12  Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence,
hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the
idols, hath committed abomination, 
\v 13  Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then
live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall
surely die; his blood shall be upon him.\f + \fr 18.13  \ft blood: Heb.

\p
\v 14 ¶ Now, lo, \add if\add* he beget a son, that seeth all his
father’s sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such
like, 
\v 15  \add That\add* hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted
up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled

\v 17  \add That\add* hath taken off his hand from the poor, \add that\add*
hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments,
hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his

\v 18  \add As for\add* his father, because he cruelly oppressed,
spoiled his brother by violence, and did \add that\add* which \add is\add*
not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, \add and\add*
hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
\v 20  The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity
of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. 
\p
\v 21  But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful
and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 22  All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall
live. 
\v 23  Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith
the Lord \nd GOD\nd*: \add and\add* not that he should return from his
ways, and live? 
\p
\v 24 ¶ But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,
and committeth iniquity, \add and\add* doeth according to all the
abominations that the wicked \add man\add* doeth, shall he live?
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his
trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned,
in them shall he die. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O
house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
\v 26  When a righteous \add man\add* turneth away from his righteousness,
and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath
done shall he die. 
\v 27  Again, when the wicked \add man\add* turneth away from his
wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful
and right, he shall save his soul alive. 
\v 28  Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions
that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 29  Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not
equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways
unequal? 
\p
\v 30  Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his

\v 31 ¶ Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have

die, O house of Israel? 
\v 32  For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith

\v 1  Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
\v 2  And say, What \add is\add* thy mother? A lioness: she lay down
among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions. 
\v 3  And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion,
and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men. 
\v 4  The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they
brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt. 
\v 5  Now when she saw that she had waited, \add and\add* her hope
was lost, then she took another of her whelps, \add and\add* made
him a young lion. 
\v 6  And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young
lion, and learned to catch the prey, \add and\add* devoured men.
\v 7  And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the
noise of his roaring.\f + \fr 19.7  \ft their desolate…: or, their

\v 8  Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces,
and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit. 
\v 9  And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the
king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be
heard upon the mountains of Israel.\f + \fr 19.9  \ft in chains: or, in

\v 10 ¶ Thy mother \add is\add* like a vine in thy blood, planted

\v 11  And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare
rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she
appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 
\v 12  But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,
and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken
and withered; the fire consumed them. 
\v 13 And now she \add is\add* planted in the wilderness, in a dry
and thirsty ground. 
\v 14  And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, \add which\add*
hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod \add to be\add*

\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth \add month\add*,
the tenth \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* certain of the
elders of Israel came to enquire of the \nd LORD\nd*, and sat before me.
\v 2  Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* unto me, saying, 
\v 3  Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Are ye come to enquire of me? \add As\add*

\ft Wilt…: or, Wilt thou plead for them\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; In the
day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the
house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt,
when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I \add am\add* the
\nd LORD\nd* your God;\f + \fr 20.5  \ft lifted…: or, sware\f* 
\v 6  In the day \add that\add* I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them
forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them,
flowing with milk and honey, which \add is\add* the glory of all
lands: 
\v 7  Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations
of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I
\add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God. 
\v 8  But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every
man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake
the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to
accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\v 9  But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
before the heathen, among whom they \add were\add*, in whose sight
I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the
land of Egypt. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
and brought them into the wilderness. 
\v 11  And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
\add if\add* a man do, he shall even live in them.\f + \fr 20.11 
\ft shewed…: Heb. made them to know\f* 
\v 12  Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* that sanctify them. 
\v 13  But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which
\add if\add* a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths
they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the
wilderness, to consume them. 
\v 14  But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out. 
\v 15  Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness,
that I would not bring them into the land which I had given \add them\add*,
flowing with milk and honey, which \add is\add* the glory of all
lands; 
\v 16  Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes,
but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
\v 17  Nevertheless mine eye spared  them from destroying them, neither did I
make an end of them in the wilderness. 
\v 18  But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the
statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile
yourselves with their idols: 
\v 19 I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God; walk in my statutes,
and keep my judgments, and do them; 
\v 20  And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God. 
\v 21  Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which \add if\add*
a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths:
then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my
anger against them in the wilderness. 
\v 22  Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s
sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen,
in whose sight I brought them forth. 
\v 23  I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would
scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
\v 24  Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised
my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after
their fathers’ idols. 
\v 25  Wherefore I gave them also statutes \add that were\add* not
good, and judgments whereby they should not live; 
\v 26  And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass
through \add the fire\add* all that openeth the womb, that I might make them
desolate, to the end that they might know that I \add am\add* the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Yet in this your
fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against
me.\f + \fr 20.27  \ft committed…: Heb. trespassed a trespass\f*
\v 28  \add For\add* when I had brought them into the land, \add for\add*
the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw
every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their
sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering:
there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink
offerings. 
\v 29  Then I said unto them, What \add is\add* the high place whereunto ye
go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.\f + \fr 20.29 
\ft I said…: or, I told them what the high place was, or, Bamah\f*
\v 30  Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord

whoredom after their abominations? 
\v 31  For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass
through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this
day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? \add As\add*
I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, I will not be enquired of by you.
\v 32  And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye
say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries,
to serve wood and stone. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ \add As\add* I live, saith  the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, surely with a

\v 35  And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I

\v 36  Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the

\v 39  As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*;
Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter \add also\add*,
if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your

\v 40  For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of

\v 41  I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you

\v 42  And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when I shall

\v 43  And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own
sight for all your evils that ye have committed. 
\v 44  And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when I have
wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked
ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel,
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 45 ¶ Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
\v 46  Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop \add thy

\v 47  And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*;
Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall

\v 48  And all flesh shall see that I the \nd LORD\nd* have kindled

\v 49  Then said I, Ah Lord \nd GOD\nd*! they say of me, Doth he not

\c 21  
\p
\v 1  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,

\v 3  And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, I

\v 4  Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the

\v 7  And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest

Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

\p
\v 13 ¶ Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest

\v 14  Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the

\p
\v 17  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 18  Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they

\v 25  \add There is\add* a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst

\v 28  And her prophets have daubed them with untempered \add morter\add*,
seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the
Lord \nd GOD\nd*, when the \nd LORD\nd* hath not spoken. 
\v 29  The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised

\v 30  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the

destroy it: but I found none. 
\v 31  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed
upon their heads, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came again unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
\v 3  And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms
in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they
bruised the teats of their virginity. 
\v 4  And the names of them \add were\add* Aholah the elder, and
Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus
\add were\add* their names; Samaria \add is\add* Aholah, and Jerusalem

\v 5  And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted
on her lovers, on the Assyrians \add her\add* neighbours, 
\v 6  \add Which were\add* clothed with blue, captains and rulers,
all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
\v 7  Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them \add that
were\add* the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted:
with all their idols she defiled herself.\f + \fr 23.7  \ft committed…: Heb. bestowed her whoredoms upon

\v 8  Neither left she her whoredoms \add brought\add* from Egypt:
for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts
of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. 
\v 9  Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
\v 10  These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among
women; for they had executed judgment upon her.\f + \fr 23.10  \ft famous: Heb. a

\p
\v 11  And when her sister Aholibah saw \add this\add*, she was more
corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her

\v 12  She doted upon the Assyrians \add her\add* neighbours, captains
and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses,
all of them desirable young men. 
\v 13  Then I saw that she was defiled, \add that\add* they \add took\add*
both one way, 
\v 14 And \add that\add* she increased her whoredoms: for when she
saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed
with vermilion, 
\v 15  Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire
upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner
of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: 
\v 16  And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and
sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.\f + \fr 23.16  \ft as soon…: Heb. at the sight of her
eyes\f* 
\v 17  And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her

Babel\f*\f + \fr 23.17  \ft alienated: Heb. loosed, or, disjointed\f*
\v 18  So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated
from her sister. 
\v 19  Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance
the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land
of Egypt. 
\v 20  For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh \add is as\add*
the flesh of asses, and whose issue \add is like\add* the issue of
horses. 
\v 21  Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,
in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I will raise
up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will
bring them against thee on every side; 
\v 23  The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
Koa, \add and\add* all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable
young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them
riding upon horses. 
\v 24  And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
wheels, and with an assembly of people, \add which\add* shall set
against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will
set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their
judgments. 
\v 25  And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears;
and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons
and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\v 26  They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away
thy fair jewels.\f + \fr 23.26  \ft fair…: Heb. instruments of thy

\v 27  Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
whoredom \add brought\add* from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift
up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. 
\v 28  For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I will deliver
thee into the hand \add of them\add* whom thou hatest, into the hand
\add of them\add* from whom thy mind is alienated: 
\v 29  And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away
all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness
of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
\v 30  I will do these \add things\add* unto thee, because thou hast gone a
whoring after the heathen, \add and\add* because thou art polluted
with their idols. 
\v 31  Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I
give her cup into thine hand. 
\v 32  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s
cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision;
it containeth much. 
\v 33  Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the
cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
\v 34  Thou shalt even drink it and suck \add it\add* out, and thou shalt
break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have
spoken \add it\add*, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\v 35  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because thou hast
forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy
lewdness and thy whoredoms. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ The \nd LORD\nd* said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou

\ft judge: or, plead for\f* 
\v 37  That they have committed adultery, and blood \add is\add*

through \add the fire\add*, to devour \add them\add*. 
\v 38  Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my

\v 39  For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they
came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they
done in the midst of mine house. 
\v 40  And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,

\v 44  Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the

\p
\v 45 ¶ And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner
of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they
\add are\add* adulteresses, and blood \add is\add* in their hands.
\v 46  For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will bring up a company

\v 48  Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all

\p
\v 1  Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth \add day\add*
of the month, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
\v 2  Son of man, write thee the name of the day, \add even\add*
of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem
this same day. 
\v 3  And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Set on a pot, set \add it\add* on, and also
pour water into it: 
\v 4  Gather the pieces thereof into it, \add even\add* every good

\v 7  For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top
of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
\v 8  That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have
set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
\v 9  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Woe to the bloody
city! I will even make the pile for fire great. 
\v 10  Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice
it well, and let the bones be burned. 
\v 11  Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be
hot, and may burn, and \add that\add* the filthiness of it may be

\v 12  She hath wearied \add herself\add* with lies, and her great

\v 13  In thy filthiness \add is\add* lewdness: because I have purged
thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy

\v 14  I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken \add it:\add* it shall come to

spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy

\p
\v 15 ¶ Also the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,

\v 19 ¶ And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these

\v 20  Then I answered them, The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me,
saying,

of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude;
Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
\p
\v 3 ¶ Behold, the Assyrian \add was\add* a cedar in Lebanon with
fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature;
and his top was among the thick boughs.\f + \fr 31.3  \ft with fair branches: Heb. fair of
branches\f* 
\v 4  The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers
unto all the trees of the field.\f + \fr 31.4  \ft made…: or, nourished
him\f*\f + \fr 31.4  \ft set…: or, brought him up\f*\f + \fr 31.4 
\ft little rivers: or, conduits\f* 
\v 5  Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long
because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.\f + \fr 31.5 
\ft when…: or, when it sent them forth\f* 
\v 6  All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his
branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young,
and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. 
\v 7  Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:
for his root was by great waters. 
\v 8  The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his
branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his
beauty. 
\v 9  I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the
trees of Eden, that \add were\add* in the garden of God, envied him.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because thou hast lifted
up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick
boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
\v 11  I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty
one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him
out for his wickedness.\f + \fr 31.11  \ft he…: Heb. in doing he shall do unto
him\f* 
\v 12  And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his
branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers
of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his
shadow, and have left him. 
\v 13  Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the
beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: 
\v 14  To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick
boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink
water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts
of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go
down to the pit.\f + \fr 31.14  \ft their trees…: or, stand upon themselves for their
height\f* 
\v 15  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; In the day when he went down
to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I
restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed:
and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field
fainted for him.\f + \fr 31.15  \ft to mourn: Heb. to be black\f*
\v 16  I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him
down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees
of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be
comforted in the nether parts of the earth. 
\v 17  They also went down into hell with him unto \add them that
be\add* slain with the sword; and \add they that were\add* his arm,
\add that\add* dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
\p
\v 18 ¶ To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden
unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the
uncircumcised with \add them that be\add* slain by the sword. This
\add is\add* Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*.
\c 32  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
in the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word
of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou
\add art\add* as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy
rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their
rivers.\f + \fr 32.2  \ft whale: or, dragon\f* 
\v 3  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will therefore spread out
my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee
up in my net. 
\v 4  Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth
upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to
remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
\v 5  And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
with thy height. 
\v 6  I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,
\add even\add* to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of
thee.\f + \fr 32.6  \ft the land wherein…: or, the land of thy swimming\f*
\v 7  And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and
make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the
moon shall not give her light.\f + \fr 32.7  \ft put…: or, extinguish
thee\f* 
\v 8  All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and

\ft bright…: Heb. lights of the light in heaven\f*\f + \fr 32.8 
\ft dark: Heb. them dark\f* 
\v 9  I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not
known.\f + \fr 32.9  \ft vex: Heb. provoke to anger, or, grief\f*
\v 10  Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword
before them; and they shall tremble at \add every\add* moment, every
man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; The sword of the king
of Babylon shall come upon thee. 
\v 12  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to
fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil
the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
\v 13  I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the
great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the
hoofs of beasts trouble them. 
\v 14  Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers
to run like oil, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\v 15  When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite
all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I \add am\add*
the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 32.15  \ft destitute…: Heb. desolate from the fulness

\v 16 This \add is\add* the lamentation wherewith they shall lament
her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her,
\add even\add* for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth
\add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
came unto me, saying, 
\v 18  Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them
down, \add even\add* her, and the daughters of the famous nations,
unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the
pit. 
\v 19  Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the

\v 20  They shall fall in the midst of \add them that are\add* slain

\v 21  The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the

\v 22  Asshur \add is\add* there and all her company: his graves
\add are\add* about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:
\v 23  Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company

\v 24 There \add is\add* Elam and all her multitude round about her

\v 25  They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her

\v 27  And they shall not lie with the mighty \add that are\add*

\v 31  Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his

\v 32  For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be

saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1  Again the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I
bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man
of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:\f + \fr 33.2  \ft When…: Heb. A land when I bring a sword upon
her\f* 
\v 3  If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
trumpet, and warn the people; 
\v 4  Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own
head.\f + \fr 33.4  \ft whosoever…: Heb. he that hearing heareth\f*
\v 5  He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver
his soul. 
\v 6  But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,
and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take \add any\add*
person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at the watchman’s hand. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth,
and warn them from me. 
\v 8  When I say unto the wicked, O wicked \add man\add*, thou shalt
surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
that wicked \add man\add* shall die in his iniquity; but his blood
will I require at thine hand. 
\v 9  Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not
turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered
thy soul. 
\p
\v 10  Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins \add be\add*
upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? 
\v 11  Say unto them, \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*,
I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked
turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 
\v 12  Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people,
The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day
of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not
fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the
righteous be able to live for his \add righteousness\add* in the
day that he sinneth. 
\v 13  When I shall say to the righteous, \add that\add* he shall
surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity,
all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity
that he hath committed, he shall die for it. 
\v 14  Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die;
if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;\f + \fr 33.14 
\ft that…: Heb. judgment and justice\f* 
\v 15  \add If\add* the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity;
he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 16  None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely
live. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. 
\v 18  When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth
iniquity, he shall even die thereby. 
\v 19  But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is
lawful and right, he shall live thereby. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house
of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity,
in the tenth \add month\add*, in the fifth \add day\add* of the month,
\add that\add* one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me,
saying, The city is smitten. 
\v 22  Now the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was upon me in the evening,
afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he
came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more
dumb. 
\v 23  Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 24  Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of
Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we
\add are\add* many; the land is given us for inheritance. 
\v 25  Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*;
Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and
shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? 
\v 26  Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile
every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land? 
\v 27  Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*;
\add As\add* I live, surely they that \add are\add* in the wastes
shall fall by the sword, and him that \add is\add* in the open field
will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that \add be\add*

\v 30 ¶ Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are

\c 34  
\p
\v 1  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying, 
\v 2  Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy,
and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* unto the shepherds;
Woe \add be\add* to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the

\v 3  Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are

\v 4  The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
that which was sick, neither have ye bound up \add that which was\add*
broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away,
neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with
cruelty have ye ruled them. 
\v 5  And they were scattered, because \add there is\add* no shepherd:
and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were
scattered.\f + \fr 34.5  \ft because…: or, without a shepherd\f*
\v 6  My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every

and none did search or seek \add after them\add*. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*;
\v 8  \add As\add* I live, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, surely because my

\p
\v 11 ¶ For thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I, \add even\add*

\v 12  As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is

\v 14  I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains

\v 19 And \add as for\add* my flock, they eat that which ye have
trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled

\p
\v 20 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* unto them; Behold, I,
\add even\add* I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the

\v 21  Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;

served themselves of them. 
\v 28  And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the

known among them, when I have judged thee. 
\v 12  And thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add and that\add* I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast
spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate,
they are given us to consume.\f + \fr 35.12  \ft to consume: Heb. to

\v 13  Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have

\v 14  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; When the whole earth rejoiceth,
I will make thee desolate. 
\v 15  As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate,
O mount Seir, and all Idumea, \add even\add* all of it: and they shall
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1  Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*:
\v 2  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because the enemy hath said
against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:
\v 3  Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because they have made
\add you\add* desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a

lips of talkers, and \add are\add* an infamy of the people:\f + \fr 36.3 
\ft Because: Heb. Because for because\f*\f + \fr 36.3  \ft are…: or, ye are made to come up on the lip of the

\v 4  Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*; Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* to the mountains, and to the
hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes,
and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision
to the residue of the heathen that \add are\add* round about;\f + \fr 36.4 
\ft rivers: or, bottoms, or, dales\f* 
\v 5  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Surely in the fire
of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen,
and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession
with the joy of all \add their\add* heart, with despiteful minds,
to cast it out for a prey. 
\v 6  Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the
mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus
saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy
and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 
\v 7  Therefore thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I have lifted up
mine hand, Surely the heathen that \add are\add* about you, they shall
bear their shame. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches,
and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand
to come. 
\v 9 For, behold, I \add am\add* for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be
tilled and sown: 
\v 10  And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,
\add even\add* all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the
wastes shall be builded: 
\v 11  And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall
increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates,
and will do better \add unto you\add* than at your beginnings: and ye shall
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 12  Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, \add even\add* my

inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them \add of
men\add*. 
\v 13  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Because they say unto you, Thou
\add land\add* devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations; 
\v 14  Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy

\v 15 Neither will I cause \add men\add* to hear in thee the shame

saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Moreover the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,
\v 17  Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land,
they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was
before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. 
\v 18  Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
shed upon the land, and for their idols \add wherewith\add* they had
polluted it: 
\v 19  And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed
through the countries: according to their way and according to their
doings I judged them. 
\v 20  And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,
they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These \add are\add*
the people of the \nd LORD\nd*, and are gone forth out of his land.
\p
\v 21 ¶ But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. 
\v 22  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*; I do not \add this\add* for your sakes, O house of Israel,
but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen,
whither ye went. 
\v 23  And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen
shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*,
when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.\f + \fr 36.23 
\ft their: or, your\f* 
\v 24  For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all
countries, and will bring you into your own land. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
cleanse you. 
\v 26  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. 
\v 27  And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk
in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do \add them\add*.
\v 28  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
\v 29  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
\v 30  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase
of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the
heathen. 
\v 31  Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that
\add were\add* not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight
for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
\v 32  Not for your sakes do I \add this\add*, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*,
be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways,
O house of Israel. 
\v 33  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; In the day that I shall have
cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause \add you\add*
to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. 
\v 34  And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
in the sight of all that passed by. 
\v 35  And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the
garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities \add are
become\add* fenced, \add and\add* are inhabited. 
\v 36  Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know
that I the \nd LORD\nd* build the ruined \add places, and\add* plant
that that was desolate: I the \nd LORD\nd* have spoken \add it\add*,
and I will do \add it\add*. 
\v 37  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; I will yet \add for\add*
this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do \add it\add* for them; I will
increase them with men like a flock. 
\v 38  As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 36.38  \ft holy…: Heb. flock of holy

\c 37  
\p
\v 1  The hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was upon me, and carried me out
in the spirit of the \nd LORD\nd*, and set me down in the midst of the
valley which \add was\add* full of bones, 
\v 2  And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, \add there
were\add* very many in the open valley; and, lo, \add they were\add*
very dry.\f + \fr 37.2  \ft valley: or, champaign\f* 
\v 3  And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
answered, O Lord \nd GOD\nd*, thou knowest. 
\v 4  Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye
dry bones, hear the word of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 5  Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: 
\v 6  And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall
know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 7  So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a
noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his
bone. 
\v 8  And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the
skin covered them above: but \add there was\add* no breath in them.
\v 9  Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son
of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Come
from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may
live.\f + \fr 37.9  \ft wind: or, breath\f* 
\v 10  So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they
lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope
is lost: we are cut off for our parts. 
\v 12  Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
\nd GOD\nd*; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come
up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 
\v 13  And ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when I have
opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
\v 14  And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall
place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the \nd LORD\nd*
have spoken \add it\add*, and performed \add it\add*, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\p
\v 15 ¶ The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came again unto me, saying,
\v 16  Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write
upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions:
then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick
of Ephraim, and \add for\add* all the house of Israel his companions:
\v 17  And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become
one in thine hand. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou \add meanest\add* by these?
\v 19  Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I will
take the stick of Joseph, which \add is\add* in the hand of Ephraim,
and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him,
\add even\add* with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick,
and they shall be one in mine hand. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
before their eyes. 
\v 21  And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; Behold, I will
take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be
gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own
land: 
\v 22  And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains
of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall
be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
\v 23  Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions:
but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have
sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their
God. 
\v 24  And David my servant \add shall be\add* king over them; and they all shall have
one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my
statutes, and do them. 
\v 25  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein,
\add even\add* they, and their children, and their children’s children
for ever: and my servant David \add shall be\add* their prince for
ever. 
\v 26  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an
everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply
them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
\v 27  My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their

\v 28  And the heathen shall know that I the \nd LORD\nd* do sanctify
Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

\v 1  And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came unto me, saying,

\v 21  And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen

\v 5  And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about,
and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits \add long\add*
by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the
building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east,
and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the
gate, \add which was\add* one reed broad; and the other threshold
\add of the gate, which was\add* one reed broad.\f + \fr 40.6  \ft which looketh…: Heb. whose face was the way toward the
east\f* 
\v 7 And \add every\add* little chamber \add was\add* one reed long,
and one reed broad; and between the little chambers \add were\add*
five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate
within \add was\add* one reed. 
\v 8  He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. 
\v 9  Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate \add was\add*
inward. 
\v 10  And the little chambers of the gate eastward \add were\add*
three on this side, and three on that side; they three \add were\add*
of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
\v 11  And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
cubits; \add and\add* the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 
\v 12  The space also before the little chambers \add was\add* one
cubit \add on this side\add*, and the space \add was\add* one cubit
on that side: and the little chambers \add were\add* six cubits on this side, and
six cubits on that side.\f + \fr 40.12  \ft space: Heb. limit, or,
bound\f* 
\v 13  He measured then the gate from the roof of \add one\add* little
chamber to the roof of another: the breadth \add was\add* five and
twenty cubits, door against door. 
\v 14  He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post
of the court round about the gate. 
\v 15  And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face
of the porch of the inner gate \add were\add* fifty cubits. 
\v 16 And \add there were\add* narrow windows to the little chambers,
and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the
arches: and windows \add were\add* round about inward: and upon \add each\add*
post \add were\add* palm trees.\f + \fr 40.16  \ft narrow: Heb. closed\f*\f + \fr 40.16 
\ft arches: or, galleries, or, porches\f*\f + \fr 40.16  \ft inward: or,

\v 17  Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, \add there
were\add* chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about:
thirty chambers \add were\add* upon the pavement. 
\v 18  And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
length of the gates \add was\add* the lower pavement. 
\v 19  Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits
eastward and northward.\f + \fr 40.19  \ft without: or, from without\f*
\p
\v 20 ¶ And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the
north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.\f + \fr 40.20 
\ft that looked: Heb. whose face was\f* 
\v 21  And the little chambers thereof \add were\add* three on this side and
three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the
measure of the first gate: the length thereof \add was\add* fifty
cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.\f + \fr 40.21  \ft arches: or, galleries, or,
porches\f* 
\v 22  And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
\add were\add* after the measure of the gate that looketh toward
the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof
\add were\add* before them. 
\v 23  And the gate of the inner court \add was\add* over against the
gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from
gate to gate an hundred cubits. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches
thereof according to these measures. 
\v 25 And \add there were\add* windows in it and in the arches thereof round
about, like those windows: the length \add was\add* fifty cubits,
and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 26 And \add there were\add* seven steps to go up to it, and the
arches thereof \add were\add* before them: and it had palm trees,
one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
\p
\v 27 And \add there was\add* a gate in the inner court toward the
south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred
cubits. 
\v 28  And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
measured the south gate according to these measures; 
\v 29  And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
arches thereof, according to these measures: and \add there were\add*
windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: \add it was\add*
fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
\v 30  And the arches round about \add were\add* five and twenty
cubits long, and five cubits broad.\f + \fr 40.30  \ft broad: Heb.
breadth\f* 
\v 31  And the arches thereof \add were\add* toward the utter court;
and palm trees \add were\add* upon the posts thereof: and the going
up to it \add had\add* eight steps. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
measured the gate according to these measures. 
\v 33  And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
arches thereof, \add were\add* according to these measures: and \add there
were\add* windows therein and in the arches thereof round about:
\add it was\add* fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\v 34  And the arches thereof \add were\add* toward the outward court;
and palm trees \add were\add* upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going
up to it \add had\add* eight steps. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ And he brought me to the north gate, and measured \add it\add*
according to these measures; 
\v 36  The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length \add was\add*
fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
\v 37  And the posts thereof \add were\add* toward the utter court;
and palm trees \add were\add* upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going
up to it \add had\add* eight steps. 
\v 38  And the chambers and the entries thereof \add were\add* by the
posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering. 
\p
\v 39 ¶ And in the porch of the gate \add were\add* two tables on this side, and two
tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin
offering and the trespass offering. 
\v 40  And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
north gate, \add were\add* two tables; and on the other side, which
\add was\add* at the porch of the gate, \add were\add* two tables.\f + \fr 40.40 
\ft as one…: or, at the step\f* 
\v 41  Four tables \add were\add* on this side, and four tables on that side, by the
side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew \add their sacrifices\add*.
\v 42  And the four tables \add were\add* of hewn stone for the burnt
offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad,
and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they
slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
\v 43  And within \add were\add* hooks, an hand broad, fastened round
about: and upon the tables \add was\add* the flesh of the offering.\f + \fr 40.43 
\ft hooks: or, andirons, or, the two hearthstones\f* 
\p
\v 44 ¶ And without the inner gate \add were\add* the chambers of the
singers in the inner court, which \add was\add* at the side of the
north gate; and their prospect \add was\add* toward the south: one
at the side of the east gate \add having\add* the prospect toward
the north. 
\v 45  And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect \add is\add*
toward the south, \add is\add* for the priests, the keepers of the
charge of the house.\f + \fr 40.45  \ft charge: or, ward, or, ordinance\f*
\v 46  And the chamber whose prospect \add is\add* toward the north
\add is\add* for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these
\add are\add* the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come
near to the \nd LORD\nd* to minister unto him. 
\v 47  So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred
cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar \add that was\add* before
the house. 
\p
\v 48 ¶ And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured
\add each\add* post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five
cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate \add was\add* three
cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. 
\v 49  The length of the porch \add was\add* twenty cubits, and the
breadth eleven cubits; and \add he brought me\add* by the steps whereby they went
up to it: and \add there were\add* pillars by the posts, one on this side, and
another on that side. 
\c 41  
\p
\v 1  Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other
side, \add which was\add* the breadth of the tabernacle. 
\v 2  And the breadth of the door \add was\add* ten cubits; and the
sides of the door \add were\add* five cubits on the one side, and
five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof,
forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.\f + \fr 41.2  \ft door: or,
entrance\f* 
\v 3  Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven
cubits. 
\v 4  So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth,
twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This \add is\add*
the most holy \add place\add*. 
\v 5  After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
breadth of \add every\add* side chamber, four cubits, round about
the house on every side. 
\v 6  And the side chambers \add were\add* three, one over another,
and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which \add was\add*
of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.\f + \fr 41.6 
\ft one…: Heb. side chamber over side chamber\f*\f + \fr 41.6  \ft thirty…: or, three and thirty times, or,
foot\f*\f + \fr 41.6  \ft have hold: Heb. be holden\f* 
\v 7 And \add there was\add* an enlarging, and a winding about still
upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still
upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house
\add was still\add* upward, and so increased \add from\add* the lowest
\add chamber\add* to the highest by the midst.\f + \fr 41.7  \ft there…: Heb. it was made broader, and went
round\f* 
\v 8  I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
of the side chambers \add were\add* a full reed of six great cubits.
\v 9  The thickness of the wall, which \add was\add* for the side
chamber without, \add was\add* five cubits: and \add that\add* which
\add was\add* left \add was\add* the place of the side chambers that
\add were\add* within. 
\v 10  And between the chambers \add was\add* the wideness of twenty
cubits round about the house on every side. 
\v 11  And the doors of the side chambers \add were\add* toward \add the place that
was\add* left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the
south: and the breadth of the place that was left \add was\add* five
cubits round about. 
\p
\v 12  Now the building that \add was\add* before the separate place
at the end toward the west \add was\add* seventy cubits broad; and the
wall of the building \add was\add* five cubits thick round about,
and the length thereof ninety cubits. 
\v 13  So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate
place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits
long; 
\v 14  Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
place toward the east, an hundred cubits. 
\v 15  And he measured the length of the building over against the separate
place which \add was\add* behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an
hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;\f + \fr 41.15 
\ft galleries: or, several walks, or, walks with pillars\f* 
\v 16  The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries
round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled
with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the
windows \add were\add* covered;\f + \fr 41.16  \ft cieled…: Heb. cieling of
wood\f*\f + \fr 41.16  \ft and from…: or, and the ground unto the
windows\f* 
\v 17  To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without,
and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.\f + \fr 41.17 
\ft measure: Heb. measures\f* 
\v 18 And \add it was\add* made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
tree \add was\add* between a cherub and a cherub; and \add every\add*
cherub had two faces; 
\v 19  So that the face of a man \add was\add* toward the palm tree
on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side:
\add it was\add* made through all the house round about. 
\v 20  From the ground unto above the door \add were\add* cherubims
and palm trees made, and \add on\add* the wall of the temple. 
\v 21  The posts of the temple \add were\add* squared, \add and\add*
the face of the sanctuary; the appearance \add of the one\add* as the
appearance \add of the other\add*.\f + \fr 41.21  \ft posts: Heb.
post\f* 
\v 22  The altar of wood \add was\add* three cubits high, and the
length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length
thereof, and the walls thereof, \add were\add* of wood: and he said unto me, This
\add is\add* the table that \add is\add* before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 23  And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
\v 24  And the doors had two leaves \add apiece\add*, two turning
leaves; two \add leaves\add* for the one door, and two leaves for the
other \add door\add*. 
\v 25 And \add there were\add* made on them, on the doors of the
temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as \add were\add* made upon the
walls; and \add there were\add* thick planks upon the face of the
porch without. 
\v 26 And \add there were\add* narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the
sides of the porch, and \add upon\add* the side chambers of the house,
and thick planks. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1  Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
the north: and he brought me into the chamber that \add was\add*
over against the separate place, and which \add was\add* before the
building toward the north. 
\v 2  Before the length of an hundred cubits \add was\add* the north
door, and the breadth \add was\add* fifty cubits. 
\v 3  Over against the twenty \add cubits\add* which \add were\add*
for the inner court, and over against the pavement which \add was\add*
for the utter court, \add was\add* gallery against gallery in three
\add stories\add*. 
\v 4  And before the chambers \add was\add* a walk of ten cubits
breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
\v 5  Now the upper chambers \add were\add* shorter: for the galleries
were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the
building.\f + \fr 42.5  \ft were higher…: or, did eat of these\f*\f + \fr 42.5 
\ft than the lower…: or, and the building consisted of the lower and the
middlemost\f* 
\v 6 For they \add were\add* in three \add stories\add*, but had not
pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore \add the building\add*
was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
\v 7  And the wall that \add was\add* without over against the chambers,
toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof
\add was\add* fifty cubits. 
\v 8  For the length of the chambers that \add were\add* in the utter
court \add was\add* fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple \add were\add*
an hundred cubits. 
\v 9  And from under these chambers \add was\add* the entry on the east
side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.\f + \fr 42.9 
\ft from under: or, from the place\f*\f + \fr 42.9  \ft the entry: or, he that brought
me\f*\f + \fr 42.9  \ft as…: or, as he came\f* 
\v 10  The chambers \add were\add* in the thickness of the wall of the
court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over
against the building. 
\v 11  And the way before them \add was\add* like the appearance
of the chambers which \add were\add* toward the north, as long as they,
\add and\add* as broad as they: and all their goings out \add were\add*
both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 
\v 12  And according to the doors of the chambers that \add were\add*
toward the south \add was\add* a door in the head of the way, \add even\add*
the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then said he unto me, The north chambers \add and\add* the
south chambers, which \add are\add* before the separate place, they
\add be\add* holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the
\nd LORD\nd* shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay
the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering,
and the trespass offering; for the place \add is\add* holy. 
\v 14  When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out
of the holy \add place\add* into the utter court, but there they shall
lay their garments wherein they minister; for they \add are\add*
holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to \add those
things\add* which \add are\add* for the people. 
\p
\v 15  Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house,
he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect \add is\add* toward
the east, and measured it round about. 
\v 16  He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred
reeds, with the measuring reed round about.\f + \fr 42.16  \ft side: Heb.
wind\f* 
\v 17  He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
reed round about. 
\v 18  He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
reed. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ He turned about to the west side, \add and\add* measured
five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
\v 20  He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
five hundred \add reeds\add* long, and five hundred broad, to make a
separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. 
\c 43  
\p
\v 1  Afterward he brought me to the gate, \add even\add* the gate
that looketh toward the east: 
\v 2  And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
of the east: and his voice \add was\add* like a noise of many waters:
and the earth shined with his glory. 
\v 3 And \add it was\add* according to the appearance of the vision
which I saw, \add even\add* according to the vision that I saw when I
came to destroy the city: and the visions \add were\add* like the
vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.\f + \fr 43.3 
\ft when…: or, when I came to prophesy that the city should be destroyed\f*
\v 4  And the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* came into the house by the
way of the gate whose prospect \add is\add* toward the east. 
\v 5  So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
and, behold, the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* filled the house. 
\v 6  And I heard \add him\add* speaking unto me out of the house;
and the man stood by me. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the
place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the
children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of
Israel no more defile, \add neither\add* they, nor their kings, by their
whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
\v 8  In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their
post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even
defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed:
wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.\f + \fr 43.8  \ft and the…: or, for there was but a wall between me and
them\f* 
\v 9  Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their
kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be
ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.\f + \fr 43.10 
\ft pattern: or, sum, or, number\f* 
\v 11  And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the
comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances
thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and
write \add it\add* in their sight, that they may keep the whole form
thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them. 
\v 12 This \add is\add* the law of the house; Upon the top of the
mountain the whole limit thereof round about \add shall be\add* most
holy. Behold, this \add is\add* the law of the house. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And these \add are\add* the measures of the altar after the
cubits: The cubit \add is\add* a cubit and an hand breadth; even the
bottom \add shall be\add* a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the
border thereof by the edge thereof round about \add shall be\add*
a span: and this \add shall be\add* the higher place of the altar.\f + \fr 43.13 
\ft bottom: Heb. bosom\f*\f + \fr 43.13  \ft edge: Heb. lip\f* 
\v 14  And from the bottom \add upon\add* the ground \add even\add*
to the lower settle \add shall be\add* two cubits, and the breadth
one cubit; and from the lesser settle \add even\add* to the greater
settle \add shall be\add* four cubits, and the breadth \add one\add*

\v 15  So the altar \add shall be\add* four cubits; and from the

\v 16  And the altar \add shall be\add* twelve \add cubits\add* long,
twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. 
\v 17  And the settle \add shall be\add* fourteen \add cubits\add*
long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border
about it \add shall be\add* half a cubit; and the bottom thereof
\add shall be\add* a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the
east. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*; These
\add are\add* the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall
make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
\v 19  And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith
the Lord \nd GOD\nd*, a young bullock for a sin offering. 
\v 20  And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put \add it\add*
on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the
border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. 
\v 21  Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall
burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
\v 22  And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar,
as they did cleanse \add it\add* with the bullock. 
\v 23  When thou hast made an end of cleansing \add it\add*, thou shalt
offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
without blemish. 
\v 24  And thou shalt offer them before the \nd LORD\nd*, and the
priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up \add for\add*
a burnt offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 25  Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat \add for\add*
a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram
out of the flock, without blemish. 
\v 26  Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate
themselves.\f + \fr 43.26  \ft consecrate…: Heb. fill their hands\f*
\v 27  And when these days are expired, it shall be, \add that\add*
upon the eighth day, and \add so\add* forward, the priests shall
make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings;
and I will accept you, saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd*.\f + \fr 43.27 
\ft peace…: or, thank offerings\f* 
\c 44  
\p
\v 1  Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it \add was\add* shut.
\v 2  Then said the \nd LORD\nd* unto me; This gate shall be shut,
it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
\nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be
shut. 
\v 3  \add It is\add* for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to
eat bread before the \nd LORD\nd*; he shall enter by the way of the
porch of \add that\add* gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\p
