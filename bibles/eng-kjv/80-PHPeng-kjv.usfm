\v 1  Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and
deacons: 
\v 2  Grace \add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father,
and \add from\add* the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3  I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
\v 4  Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
joy, 
\v 5  For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
now; 
\v 6  Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun
a good work in you will perform \add it\add* until the day of Jesus
Christ: 
\v 7  Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because
I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my
grace. 
\v 8  For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
bowels of Jesus Christ. 
\v 9  And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
in knowledge and \add in\add* all judgment; 
\v 10  That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may
be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; 
\v 11  Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by
Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 
\p
\v 12  But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
\add which happened\add* unto me have fallen out rather unto the
furtherance of the gospel; 
\v 13  So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace,
and in all other \add places\add*; 
\v 14  And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by
my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
\v 15  Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some
also of good will: 
\v 16  The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing
to add affliction to my bonds: 
\v 17  But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence
of the gospel. 
\v 18  What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence,
or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and
will rejoice. 
\v 19  For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
\v 20  According to my earnest expectation and \add my\add* hope,
that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but \add that\add* with all boldness,
as always, \add so\add* now also Christ shall be magnified in my
body, whether \add it be\add* by life, or by death. 
\v 21  For to me to live \add is\add* Christ, and to die \add is\add*
gain. 
\v 22  But if I live in the flesh, this \add is\add* the fruit of
my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. 
\v 23  For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
and to be with Christ; which is far better: 
\v 24  Nevertheless to abide in the flesh \add is\add* more needful
for you. 
\v 25  And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
\v 26  That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for
me by my coming to you again. 
\v 27  Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may
hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one
mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
\v 28  And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to
them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and
that of God. 
\v 29  For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 
\v 30  Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear
\add to be\add* in me. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  If \add there be\add* therefore any consolation in Christ,
if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels
and mercies, 
\v 2  Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
\add being\add* of one accord, of one mind. 
\v 3  \add Let\add* nothing \add be done\add* through strife or vainglory;
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
\v 4  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of
others. 
\v 5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
\v 6  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
equal with God: 
\v 7  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 
\v 8  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 
\v 9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
name which is above every name: 
\v 10  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of \add things\add*
in heaven, and \add things\add* in earth, and \add things\add* under the
earth; 
\v 11  And \add that\add* every tongue should confess that Jesus
Christ \add is\add* Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
\p
\v 12  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in
my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
own salvation with fear and trembling. 
\v 13  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do
of \add his\add* good pleasure. 
\v 14  Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 
\v 15  That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without
rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom
ye shine as lights in the world; 
\v 16  Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the
day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
\v 17  Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
\v 18  For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 
\p
\v 19  But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
\v 20  For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for
your state. 
\v 21  For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
\v 22  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father,
he hath served with me in the gospel. 
\v 23  Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall
see how it will go with me. 
\v 24  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
\v 25  Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger,
and he that ministered to my wants. 
\v 26  For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
that ye had heard that he had been sick. 
\v 27  For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy
on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow
upon sorrow. 
\v 28  I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see
him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
\v 29  Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
such in reputation: 
\v 30  Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
things to you, to me indeed \add is\add* not grievous, but for you
\add it is\add* safe. 
\p
\v 2  Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
\v 3  For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit,
and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
\v 4  Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other
man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I
more: 
\v 5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, \add of\add*
the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the
law, a Pharisee; 
\v 6  Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness
which is in the law, blameless. 
\v 7  But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
\v 8  Yea doubtless, and I count all things \add but\add* loss for
the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them \add but\add*
dung, that I may win Christ, 
\v 9  And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith: 
\v 10  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his
death; 
\v 11  If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
dead. 
\v 12  Not as though I had already attained, either were already
perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which
also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. 
\v 13  Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but \add this\add*
one thing \add I do\add*, forgetting those things which are behind,
and reaching forth unto those things which are before, 
\v 14  I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
of God in Christ Jesus. 
\v 15  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this
unto you. 
\v 16  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk
by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. 
\v 17  Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
walk so as ye have us for an ensample. 
\v 18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
you even weeping, \add that they are\add* the enemies of the cross
of Christ: 
\v 19  Whose end \add is\add* destruction, whose God \add is their\add*
belly, and \add whose\add* glory \add is\add* in their shame, who
mind earthly things.) 
\v 20  For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
\v 21  Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able
even to subdue all things unto himself. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, \add my\add* dearly beloved.
\v 2  I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind
in the Lord. 
\v 3  And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women
which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and \add with\add*
other my fellowlabourers, whose names \add are\add* in the book of
life. 
\v 4  Rejoice in the Lord alway: \add and\add* again I say, Rejoice.
\v 5  Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord \add is\add*
at hand. 
\v 6  Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
\v 7  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. 
\v 8  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
\add are\add* honest, whatsoever things \add are\add* just, whatsoever
things \add are\add* pure, whatsoever things \add are\add* lovely,
whatsoever things \add are\add* of good report; if \add there be\add*
any virtue, and if \add there be\add* any praise, think on these
things. 
\v 9  Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
\p
\v 10  But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but
ye lacked opportunity. 
\v 11  Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
whatsoever state I am, \add therewith\add* to be content. 
\v 12  I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
\v 13  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
\v 14  Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
with my affliction. 
\v 15  Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with
me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 
\v 16  For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
\v 17  Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound
to your account. 
\v 18  But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
Epaphroditus the things \add which were sent\add* from you, an odour
of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 
\v 19  But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches
in glory by Christ Jesus. 
\v 20  Now unto God and our Father \add be\add* glory for ever and
ever. Amen. 
\p
\v 21  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are
with me greet you. 
\v 22  All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s
household. 
\v 23  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you all.
Amen. 
\s1 It was written to the Philippians from Rome by Epaphroditus.
