\c 1  
\p
\v 1  How doth the city sit solitary, \add that was\add* full of
people! \add how\add* is she become as a widow! she \add that was\add*
great among the nations, \add and\add* princess among the provinces,
\add how\add* is she become tributary! 
\v 2  She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears \add are\add*
on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort \add her:\add*
all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her
enemies. 
\v 3  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of
great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest:
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.\f + \fr 1.3 
\ft because of great…: Heb. for the greatness of servitude\f* 
\v 4  The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins
are afflicted, and she \add is\add* in bitterness. 
\v 5  Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
\nd LORD\nd* hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:
her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. 
\v 6  And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
princes are become like harts \add that\add* find no pasture, and they are
gone without strength before the pursuer. 
\v 7  Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old,
when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help
her: the adversaries saw her, \add and\add* did mock at her sabbaths.\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft pleasant: or, desirable\f* 
\v 8  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:
yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.\f + \fr 1.8  \ft is…: Heb. is become a removing, or,
wandering\f* 
\v 9  Her filthiness \add is\add* in her skirts; she remembereth
not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
comforter. O \nd LORD\nd*, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath
magnified \add himself\add*. 
\v 10  The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
things: for she hath seen \add that\add* the heathen entered into her
sanctuary, whom thou didst command \add that\add* they should not
enter into thy congregation.\f + \fr 1.10  \ft pleasant: or, desirable\f*
\v 11  All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant
things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O \nd LORD\nd*, and consider;
for I am become vile.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft to…: or, to make the soul to come
again\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ \add Is it\add* nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold,
and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done
unto me, wherewith the \nd LORD\nd* hath afflicted \add me\add* in the
day of his fierce anger.\f + \fr 1.12  \ft Is it…: or, It is nothing\f*\f + \fr 1.12 
\ft pass by: Heb. pass by the way?\f* 
\v 13  From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me
back: he hath made me desolate \add and\add* faint all the day. 
\v 14  The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
wreathed, \add and\add* come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength
to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into \add their\add* hands, \add from
whom\add* I am not able to rise up. 
\v 15  The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty \add men\add*
in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush
my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah,
\add as\add* in a winepress.\f + \fr 1.15  \ft the virgin…: or, the winepress of the virgin,
etc\f* 
\v 16 For these \add things\add* I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth
down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul
is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.\f + \fr 1.16 
\ft relieve: Heb. bring back\f* 
\v 17  Zion spreadeth forth her hands, \add and there is\add* none to
comfort her: the \nd LORD\nd* hath commanded concerning Jacob, \add that\add*
his adversaries \add should be\add* round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous
woman among them. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ The \nd LORD\nd* is righteous; for I have rebelled against his
commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow:
my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.\f + \fr 1.18 
\ft commandment: Heb. mouth\f* 
\v 19  I called for my lovers, \add but\add* they deceived me: my
priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they
sought their meat to relieve their souls. 
\v 20  Behold, O \nd LORD\nd*; for I \add am\add* in distress: my
bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously
rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home \add there is\add*
as death. 
\v 21  They have heard that I sigh: \add there is\add* none to comfort
me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast
done \add it:\add* thou wilt bring the day \add that\add* thou hast
called, and they shall be like unto me.\f + \fr 1.21  \ft called: or,
proclaimed\f* 
\v 22  Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast
done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs \add are\add*
many, and my heart \add is\add* faint. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud
in his anger, \add and\add* cast down from heaven unto the earth
the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day
of his anger! 
\v 2  The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not
pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the
daughter of Judah; he hath brought \add them\add* down to the ground:
he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.\f + \fr 2.2 
\ft brought…: Heb. made to touch\f* 
\v 3  He hath cut off in \add his\add* fierce anger all the horn
of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy,
and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, \add which\add*
devoureth round about. 
\v 4  He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
hand as an adversary, and slew all \add that were\add* pleasant to the
eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his
fury like fire.\f + \fr 2.4  \ft all…: Heb. all the desirable of the
eye\f* 
\v 5  The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed
up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath
increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. 
\v 6  And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as \add if it were
of\add* a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the
\nd LORD\nd* hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten
in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king
and the priest.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft tabernacle: or, hedge\f* 
\v 7  The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces;
they have made a noise in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, as in the
day of a solemn feast.\f + \fr 2.7  \ft given up: Heb. shut up\f*
\v 8  The \nd LORD\nd* hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter
of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his
hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall
to lament; they languished together.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft destroying: Heb. swallowing
up\f* 
\v 9  Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken
her bars: her king and her princes \add are\add* among the Gentiles:
the law \add is\add* no \add more;\add* her prophets also find no
vision from the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 10  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, \add and\add*
keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have
girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down
their heads to the ground. 
\v 11  Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver
is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my
people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets
of the city.\f + \fr 2.11  \ft swoon: or, faint\f* 
\v 12  They say to their mothers, Where \add is\add* corn and wine?
when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their
soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom. 
\v 13  What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I
liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may
comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach \add is\add*
great like the sea: who can heal thee? 
\v 14  Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not
discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen
for thee false burdens and causes of banishment. 
\v 15  All that pass by clap \add their\add* hands at thee; they
hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, \add saying,
Is\add* this the city that \add men\add* call The perfection of beauty,
The joy of the whole earth?\f + \fr 2.15  \ft by: Heb. by the way\f*
\v 16  All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed \add her\add*
up: certainly this \add is\add* the day that we looked for; we have
found, we have seen \add it\add*. 
\v 17  The \nd LORD\nd* hath done \add that\add* which he had devised;
he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:
he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused \add thine\add*
enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
\v 18  Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of
Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no
rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease. 
\v 19  Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift
up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that
faint for hunger in the top of every street. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Behold, O \nd LORD\nd*, and consider to whom thou hast done
this. Shall the women eat their fruit, \add and\add* children of a span
long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary
of the Lord?\f + \fr 2.20  \ft of a span…: or, swaddled with their
hands?\f* 
\v 21  The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain
\add them\add* in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, \add and\add*
not pitied. 
\v 22  Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,
so that in the day of the \nd LORD’s\nd* anger none escaped nor remained:
those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 I \add am\add* the man \add that\add* hath seen affliction by the
rod of his wrath. 
\v 2  He hath led me, and brought \add me into\add* darkness, but not
\add into\add* light. 
\v 3  Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand \add against
me\add* all the day. 
\v 4  My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
\v 5  He hath builded against me, and compassed \add me\add* with
gall and travail. 
\v 6  He hath set me in dark places, as \add they that be\add* dead
of old. 
\v 7  He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my
chain heavy. 
\v 8  Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 
\v 9  He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
crooked. 
\v 10 He \add was\add* unto me \add as\add* a bear lying in wait,
\add and as\add* a lion in secret places. 
\v 11  He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
made me desolate. 
\v 12  He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
\v 13  He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.\f + \fr 3.13 
\ft arrows: Heb. sons\f* 
\v 14  I was a derision to all my people; \add and\add* their song
all the day. 
\v 15  He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken
with wormwood.\f + \fr 3.15  \ft bitterness: Heb. bitternesses\f*
\v 16  He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered
me with ashes.\f + \fr 3.16  \ft covered…: or, rolled me in the ashes\f*
\v 17  And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
prosperity.\f + \fr 3.17  \ft prosperity: Heb. good\f* 
\v 18  And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the \nd LORD\nd*:
\v 19  Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
gall.\f + \fr 3.19  \ft Remembering: or, Remember\f* 
\v 20  My soul hath \add them\add* still in remembrance, and is humbled in
me.\f + \fr 3.20  \ft humbled: Heb. bowed\f* 
\p
\v 21  This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.\f + \fr 3.21 
\ft recall…: Heb. make to return to my heart\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ \add It is of\add* the \nd LORD’s\nd* mercies that we are not
consumed, because his compassions fail not. 
\v 23  \add They are\add* new every morning: great \add is\add* thy
faithfulness. 
\v 24  The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I
hope in him. 
\v 25  The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* good unto them that wait for him, to the
soul \add that\add* seeketh him. 
\v 26  \add It is\add* good that \add a man\add* should both hope
and quietly wait for the salvation of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 27  \add It is\add* good for a man that he bear the yoke in his
youth. 
\v 28  He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne
\add it\add* upon him. 
\v 29  He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
\v 30  He giveth \add his\add* cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled
full with reproach. 
\v 31  For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 
\v 32  But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the
multitude of his mercies. 
\v 33  For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children
of men.\f + \fr 3.33  \ft willingly: Heb. from his heart\f* 
\v 34  To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 
\v 35  To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
High,\f + \fr 3.35  \ft the most High: or, a superior\f* 
\v 36  To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.\f + \fr 3.36 
\ft approveth not: or, seeth not\f* 
\p
\v 37 ¶ Who \add is\add* he \add that\add* saith, and it cometh to pass,
\add when\add* the Lord commandeth \add it\add* not? 
\v 38  Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and
good? 
\v 39  Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his
sins?\f + \fr 3.39  \ft complain: or, murmur\f* 
\v 40  Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 41  Let us lift up our heart with \add our\add* hands unto God
in the heavens. 
\p
\v 42  We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
\v 43  Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast
slain, thou hast not pitied. 
\v 44  Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that \add our\add*
prayer should not pass through. 
\v 45  Thou hast made us \add as\add* the offscouring and refuse
in the midst of the people. 
\v 46  All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 
\v 47  Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
\v 48  Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction
of the daughter of my people. 
\v 49  Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
\v 50  Till the \nd LORD\nd* look down, and behold from heaven. 
\v 51  Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters
of my city.\f + \fr 3.51  \ft mine heart: Heb. my soul\f*\f + \fr 3.51 
\ft because…: or, more than all\f* 
\v 52  Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 
\v 53  They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
\v 54  Waters flowed over mine head; \add then\add* I said, I am cut
off. 
\p
\v 55 ¶ I called upon thy name, O \nd LORD\nd*, out of the low dungeon.
\v 56  Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing,
at my cry. 
\v 57  Thou drewest near in the day \add that\add* I called upon thee: thou
saidst, Fear not. 
\v 58  O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
redeemed my life. 
\v 59  O \nd LORD\nd*, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
\v 60  Thou hast seen all their vengeance \add and\add* all their
imaginations against me. 
\v 61  Thou hast heard their reproach, O \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add*
all their imaginations against me; 
\v 62  The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device
against me all the day. 
\v 63  Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I \add am\add*
their musick. 
\p
\v 64 ¶ Render unto them a recompence, O \nd LORD\nd*, according to the
work of their hands. 
\v 65  Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.\f + \fr 3.65 
\ft sorrow…: or, obstinacy of heart\f* 
\v 66  Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens
of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  How is the gold become dim! \add how\add* is the most fine
gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top
of every street. 
\v 2  The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
\v 3  Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young
ones: the daughter of my people \add is become\add* cruel, like the
ostriches in the wilderness.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft sea…: or, sea calves\f*
\v 4  The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his
mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, \add and\add* no man
breaketh \add it\add* unto them. 
\v 5  They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 
\v 6  For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people
is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown
as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.\f + \fr 4.6  \ft punishment of the iniquity: or,
iniquity\f* 
\v 7  Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,
they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing \add was\add*
of sapphire: 
\v 8  Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a
stick.\f + \fr 4.8  \ft blacker…: Heb. darker than blackness\f* 
\v 9  \add They that be\add* slain with the sword are better than
\add they that be\add* slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for
\add want of\add* the fruits of the field.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft pine…: Heb. flow
out\f* 
\v 10  The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\v 11  The \nd LORD\nd* hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured
out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
devoured the foundations thereof. 
\v 12  The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have
entered into the gates of Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ For the sins of her prophets, \add and\add* the iniquities
of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
\v 14  They have wandered \add as\add* blind \add men\add* in the
streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could
not touch their garments.\f + \fr 4.14  \ft so…: or, in that they could not but
touch\f* 
\v 15  They cried unto them, Depart ye; \add it is\add* unclean;
depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they
said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn \add there\add*.\f + \fr 4.15 
\ft it…: or, ye polluted\f* 
\v 16  The anger of the \nd LORD\nd* hath divided them; he will no
more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests,
they favoured not the elders.\f + \fr 4.16  \ft anger: or, face\f*
\v 17  As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
watching we have watched for a nation \add that\add* could not save
\add us\add*. 
\v 18  They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our
end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 
\v 19  Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness. 
\v 20  The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the \nd LORD\nd*,
was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall
live among the heathen. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be
drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter
of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will
visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.\f + \fr 4.22 
\ft The…: or, Thine iniquity\f*\f + \fr 4.22  \ft discover…: or, carry thee captive for thy
sins\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Remember, O \nd LORD\nd*, what is come upon us: consider, and
behold our reproach. 
\v 2  Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
\v 3  We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers \add are\add* as
widows. 
\v 4  We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto
us.\f + \fr 5.4  \ft is…: Heb. cometh for price\f* 
\v 5  Our necks \add are\add* under persecution: we labour, \add and\add*
have no rest.\f + \fr 5.5  \ft Our…: Heb. On our necks are we persecuted\f*
\v 6  We have given the hand \add to\add* the Egyptians, \add and
to\add* the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
\v 7  Our fathers have sinned, \add and are\add* not; and we have
borne their iniquities. 
\v 8  Servants have ruled over us: \add there is\add* none that doth
deliver \add us\add* out of their hand. 
\v 9  We gat our bread with \add the peril of\add* our lives because
of the sword of the wilderness. 
\v 10  Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.\f + \fr 5.10 
\ft terrible: or, terrors, or, storms\f* 
\v 11  They ravished the women in Zion, \add and\add* the maids in the
cities of Judah. 
\v 12  Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not
honoured. 
\v 13  They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the
wood. 
\v 14  The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
musick. 
\v 15  The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
\v 16  The crown is fallen \add from\add* our head: woe unto us, that we have
sinned!\f + \fr 5.16  \ft The…: Heb. The crown of our head is fallen\f*
\p
\v 17  For this our heart is faint; for these \add things\add* our
eyes are dim. 
\v 18  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
walk upon it. 
\v 19  Thou, O \nd LORD\nd*, remainest  for ever; thy throne from
generation to generation. 
\v 20  Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, \add and\add* forsake
us so long time?\f + \fr 5.20  \ft so…: Heb. for length of days?\f*
\v 21  Turn thou us unto thee, O \nd LORD\nd*, and we shall be turned;
renew our days as of old. 
\v 22  But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against
us.\f + \fr 5.22  \ft But…: or, For wilt thou utterly reject us?\f*
