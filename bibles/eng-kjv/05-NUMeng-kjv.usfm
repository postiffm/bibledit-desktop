\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying,

every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled
by the dead: 
\v 3  Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye
put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof
I dwell. 
\v 4  And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
the camp: as the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, so did the children
of Israel. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6  Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the \nd LORD\nd*,
and that person be guilty; 
\v 7  Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall

fifth \add part\add* thereof, and give \add it\add* unto \add him\add*
against whom he hath trespassed. 
\v 8  But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the
trespass be recompensed unto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add even\add* to the
priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be
made for him. 
\v 9  And every offering of all the holy things of the children of

\v 11 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 
\v 13  And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and \add there
be\add* no witness against her, neither she be taken \add with the

\v 14  And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous
of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come
upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\v 15  Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall
bring her offering for her, the tenth \add part\add* of an ephah
of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it
\add is\add* an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing
iniquity to remembrance. 
\v 16  And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
\nd LORD\nd*: 
\v 17  And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;
and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
shall take, and put \add it\add* into the water: 
\v 18  And the priest shall set the woman before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her
hands, which \add is\add* the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his
hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: 
\v 19  And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside
to uncleanness \add with another\add* instead of thy husband, be thou
free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:\f + \fr 5.19 
\ft with another…: or, being in the power of thy husband: Heb. under thy

\v 20  But if thou hast gone aside \add to another\add* instead of thy
husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
beside thine husband: 
\v 21  Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing,
and the priest shall say unto the woman, The \nd LORD\nd* make thee a
curse and an oath among thy people, when the \nd LORD\nd* doth make
thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;\f + \fr 5.21  \ft rot: Heb.
fall\f* 
\v 22  And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make
\add thy\add* belly to swell, and \add thy\add* thigh to rot: And the
woman shall say, Amen, amen. 
\v 23  And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall
blot \add them\add* out with the bitter water: 
\v 24  And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the
curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,
\add and become\add* bitter. 
\v 25  Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and offer it upon the altar: 
\v 26  And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, \add even\add*
the memorial thereof, and burn \add it\add* upon the altar, and afterward
shall cause the woman to drink the water. 
\v 27  And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass,
\add that\add*, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her
husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,
\add and become\add* bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh
shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. 
\v 28  And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be
free, and shall conceive seed. 
\v 29 This \add is\add* the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth
aside \add to another\add* instead of her husband, and is defiled;
\v 30  Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. 
\v 31  Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
shall bear her iniquity. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either

\add and\add* shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow. 
\v 6  All the days that he separateth \add himself\add* unto the
\nd LORD\nd* he shall come at no dead body. 
\v 7  He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the

\ft consecration: Heb. separation\f* 
\v 8  All the days of his separation he \add is\add* holy unto the

\v 9  And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the
day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 
\v 10  And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
\v 11  And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that
he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. 
\v 12  And he shall consecrate unto the \nd LORD\nd* the days of his

\p
\v 13 ¶ And this \add is\add* the law of the Nazarite, when the days

\v 14  And he shall offer his offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*, one

one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 
\v 15  And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings. 
\v 16  And the priest shall bring \add them\add* before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering: 
\v 17  And he shall offer the ram \add for\add* a sacrifice of peace
offerings unto the \nd LORD\nd*, with the basket of unleavened bread:
the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.
\v 18  And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation \add at\add*
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the
hair of the head of his separation, and put \add it\add* in the fire which
\add is\add* under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 
\v 19  And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram,

\p
\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23  Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall
bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, 
\v 24  The \nd LORD\nd* bless thee, and keep thee: 
\v 25  The \nd LORD\nd* make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
\v 26  The \nd LORD\nd* lift up his countenance upon thee, and give

\v 27  And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will
bless them.

\p
\v 1  And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up
the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the

\v 8  And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari,

\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6  Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
\v 7  And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle

\v 9  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the

of Israel together: 
\v 10  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the \nd LORD\nd*:
and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

\v 15  And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the

offer them \add for\add* an offering. 
\v 16 For they \add are\add* wholly given unto me from among the

of\add* the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
\v 17  For all the firstborn of the children of Israel \add are\add* mine,
\add both\add* man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn
in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 
\v 18  And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the

\v 19  And I have given the Levites \add as\add* a gift to Aaron
and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service

\v 21  And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes;
and Aaron offered them \add as\add* an offering before the \nd LORD\nd*;

\v 22  And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the

\v 23 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying,

\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses in the wilderness of
Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come
out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
\v 2  Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed
season. 
\v 3  In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep
it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the

\v 4  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should

\v 5  And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first

\nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they
came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 
\v 7  And those men said unto him, We \add are\add* defiled by the dead
body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer
an offering of the \nd LORD\nd* in his appointed season among the
children of Israel? 
\v 8  And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the
\nd LORD\nd* will command concerning you. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 10  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your
posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or \add be\add*
in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 11  The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall

\v 12  They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any

keep it. 
\v 13  But the man that \add is\add* clean, and is not in a journey,
and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut
off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the
\nd LORD\nd* in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\v 14  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
passover unto the \nd LORD\nd*; according to the ordinance of the

\v 15 ¶ And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud

\v 18  At the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* the children of Israel
journeyed, and at the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* they pitched:

of the \nd LORD\nd*, at the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd* by the

\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly,
and for the journeying of the camps. 
\v 3  And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation. 
\v 4  And if they blow \add but\add* with one \add trumpet\add*,
then the princes, \add which are\add* heads of the thousands of Israel,

\v 5  When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
parts shall go forward. 
\v 6  When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that
lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an
alarm for their journeys. 
\v 7  But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 
\v 8  And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
generations. 
\v 9  And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth
you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be
remembered before the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and ye shall be saved
from your enemies. 
\v 10  Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days,
and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets
over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace
offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I
\add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God.

\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass on the twentieth \add day\add* of the

\v 30  And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own

was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. 
\v 11  And Moses said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, Wherefore hast thou
afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy

\v 12  Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest

\v 13  Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they

\v 12  Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.

\v 4 And these \add were\add* their names: of the tribe of Reuben,
Shammua the son of Zaccur. 
\v 5  Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 
\v 6  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

\v 12  Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
\v 13  Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
\v 14  Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
\v 15  Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
\v 16 These \add are\add* the names of the men which Moses sent to spy

\p
\v 17 ¶ And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
unto them, Get you up this \add way\add* southward, and go up into the
mountain: 
\v 18  And see the land, what it \add is;\add* and the people that
dwelleth therein, whether they \add be\add* strong or weak, few or

\v 19  And what the land \add is\add* that they dwell in, whether it
\add be\add* good or bad; and what cities \add they be\add* that they

\v 20  And what the land \add is\add*, whether it \add be\add* fat
or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good
courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time \add was\add*
the time of the firstripe grapes. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness
of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 
\v 22  And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, \add were\add*.
(Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
\v 23  And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a
branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a
staff; and \add they brought\add* of the pomegranates, and of the
figs.\f + \fr 13.23  \ft brook: or, valley\f* 
\v 24  The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of

\v 25  And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,
to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation,
and shewed them the fruit of the land. 
\v 27  And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this \add is\add*
the fruit of it. 
\v 28  Nevertheless the people \add be\add* strong that dwell in the
land, and the cities \add are\add* walled, \add and\add* very great:
and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. 
\v 29  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,
and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the
Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. 
\v 30  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
\v 31  But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
up against the people; for they \add are\add* stronger than we. 
\v 32  And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have
gone to search it, \add is\add* a land that eateth up the inhabitants
thereof; and all the people that we saw in it \add are\add* men of a great
stature.\f + \fr 13.32  \ft men…: Heb. men of statures\f* 
\v 33  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, \add which

and so we were in their sight. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;
and the people wept that night. 
\v 2  And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had
died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
\v 3  And wherefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* brought us unto this land,
to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 
\v 4  And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
return into Egypt. 
\p
\v 5  Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
\add which were\add* of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
\v 7  And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, \add is\add*
an exceeding good land. 
\v 8  If the \nd LORD\nd* delight in us, then he will bring us into this
land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 
\v 9  Only rebel not ye against the \nd LORD\nd*, neither fear ye the
people of the land; for they \add are\add* bread for us: their defence
is departed from them, and the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* with us:

\v 10  But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
glory of the \nd LORD\nd* appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation
before all the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, How long will this
people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the
signs which I have shewed among them? 
\v 12  I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will
make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Moses said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, Then the Egyptians
shall hear \add it\add*, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy
might from among them;) 
\v 14  And they will tell \add it\add* to the inhabitants of this

among this people, that thou \nd LORD\nd* art seen face to face, and
\add that\add* thy cloud standeth over them, and \add that\add* thou

of fire by night. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now \add if\add* thou shalt kill \add all\add* this people
as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will
speak, saying, 
\v 16  Because the \nd LORD\nd* was not able to bring this people

wilderness. 
\v 17  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
according as thou hast spoken, saying, 
\v 18  The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* longsuffering, and of great
mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing
\add the guilty\add*, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth \add generation\add*. 
\v 19  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the

\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, I have pardoned according to thy

\v 21 But \add as\add* truly \add as\add* I live, all the earth shall be
filled with the glory of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these
ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
\v 23  Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their

and his seed shall possess it. 
\v 25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the
Red sea. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 27 How long \add shall I bear with\add* this evil congregation,

of Israel, which they murmur against me. 
\v 28  Say unto them, \add  As truly as\add* I live, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 
\v 29  Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were

old and upward, which have murmured against me,

\v 31  But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring

\v 32 But \add as for\add* you, your carcases, they shall fall in this

\v 33  And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.\f + \fr 14.33

\v 35  I the \nd LORD\nd* have said, I will surely do it unto all this

\p
\v 36  And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,
and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing
up a slander upon the land, 
\v 37  Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
land, died by the plague before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 38  But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
\add which were\add* of the men that went to search the land, lived
\add still\add*. 
\v 39  And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
and the people mourned greatly. 
\p
\v 40 ¶ And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we \add be here\add*, and will go
up unto the place which the \nd LORD\nd* hath promised: for we have
sinned. 
\v 41  And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
of the \nd LORD\nd*? but it shall not prosper. 
\v 42  Go not up, for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* not among you; that ye be not
smitten before your enemies. 
\v 43  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites \add are\add* there

\v 44  But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
ark of the covenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and Moses, departed not
out of the camp. 
\v 45  Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt

\v 11  Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a

\v 17  And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and

\v 18  And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and

\v 19  And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the

\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 21  Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may

\v 22  And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the

\v 26  And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the

\v 27  So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,

of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little

\v 28  And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the \nd LORD\nd*
hath sent me to do all these works; for \add I have\add* not \add done

\p
\v 35  And there came out a fire from the \nd LORD\nd*, and consumed

no stranger, which \add is\add* not of the seed of Aaron, come near
to offer incense before the \nd LORD\nd*; that he be not as Korah,
and as his company: as the \nd LORD\nd* said to him by the hand of
Moses. 
\p
\v 41 ¶ But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have
killed the people of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 42  And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the
\nd LORD\nd* appeared. 
\v 43  And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 44 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying, 
\v 45  Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 
\p
\v 46 ¶ And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from
off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation,
and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the
\nd LORD\nd*; the plague is begun. 
\v 47  And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst
of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\v 48  And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
was stayed. 
\v 49  Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. 
\v 50  And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation: and the plague was stayed. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a
rod according to the house of \add their\add* fathers, of all their
princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write
thou every man’s name upon his rod. 
\v 3  And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for
one rod \add shall be\add* for the head of the house of their fathers.
\v 4  And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
before the testimony, where I will meet with you. 
\v 5 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the man’s rod, whom I shall
choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings
of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their
fathers’ houses, \add even\add* twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron
\add was\add* among their rods.\f + \fr 17.6  \ft a rod…: Heb. a rod for one prince, a rod for one

\v 7  And Moses laid up the rods before the \nd LORD\nd* in the tabernacle

\p
\v 8  And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house
of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms,
and yielded almonds. 
\v 9  And Moses brought out all the rods from before the \nd LORD\nd*
unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
man his rod. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again
before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels;
and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
die not.\f + \fr 17.10  \ft rebels: Heb. children of rebellion\f*
\v 11  And Moses did \add so:\add* as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
him, so did he. 
\v 12  And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we
die, we perish, we all perish. 
\v 13  Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
\nd LORD\nd* shall die: shall we be consumed with dying? 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
father’s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary:
and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
\v 2  And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and
minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee \add shall minister\add*
before the tabernacle of witness. 
\v 3  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle:
only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the
altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 
\v 4  And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 
\v 5  And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of
Israel. 
\v 6  And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
among the children of Israel: to you \add they are\add* given \add as\add*
a gift for the \nd LORD\nd*, to do the service of the tabernacle
of the congregation. 
\v 7  Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s
office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall
serve: I have given your priest’s office \add unto you\add* as a
service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to
death. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have
given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed
things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the
anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. 
\v 9  This shall be thine of the most holy things, \add reserved\add*
from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin

\v 10  In the most holy \add place\add* shalt thou eat it; every

\v 11 And this \add is\add* thine; the heave offering of their gift,
with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a

\v 12  All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the

\v 14  Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
\v 15  Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
bring unto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add whether it be\add* of men or beasts,
shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 
\v 16  And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,
after the shekel of the sanctuary, which \add is\add* twenty gerahs.
\v 17  But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they \add are\add* holy:
thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their

\v 18  And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the

\v 19  All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
of Israel offer unto the \nd LORD\nd*, have I given thee, and thy

a covenant of salt for ever before the \nd LORD\nd* unto thee and to thy

\p
\v 20 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no

\add am\add* thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
Israel. 
\v 21  And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth

\add even\add* the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\v 22  Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the

of Israel they have no inheritance. 
\v 24  But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer
\add as\add* an heave offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*, I have given
to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among
the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  unto Moses, saying,

of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your

\v 27 And \add this\add* your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though

\v 28  Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the \nd LORD\nd*

\v 31  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it
\add is\add* your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the

\v 32  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things
of the children of Israel, lest ye die. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 2 This \add is\add* the ordinance of the law which the \nd LORD\nd*
hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they

\v 3  And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her

\v 4  And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation
seven times: 
\v 5 And \add one\add* shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin,

\v 7  Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe
his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the

\v 8  And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 9  And a man \add that is\add* clean shall gather up the ashes
of the heifer, and lay \add them\add* up without the camp in a clean

\v 10  And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his

\v 13  Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead,
and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*;
and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of
separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness
\add is\add* yet upon him. 
\v 14 This \add is\add* the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that

he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in

\v 20  But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that

\v 1  Then came the children of Israel, \add even\add* the whole

\v 2  And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered

\v 3  And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
that we had died when our brethren died before the \nd LORD\nd*!
\v 4  And why have ye brought up the congregation of the \nd LORD\nd*
into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? 
\v 5  And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring

\v 11  And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the

drank, and their beasts \add also\add*.

\v 12 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye

\v 18  And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come

\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* sent fiery serpents among the people,

many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
\v 4  And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
lick up all \add that are\add* round about us, as the ox licketh
up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor \add was\add*
king of the Moabites at that time. 
\v 5  He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
Pethor, which \add is\add* by the river of the land of the children
of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come
out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they
abide over against me:\f + \fr 22.5  \ft face: Heb. eye\f* 
\v 6  Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they
\add are\add* too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, \add that\add*
we may smite them, and \add that\add* I may drive them out of the
land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest \add is\add* blessed,
and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 
\v 7  And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of
divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the
words of Balak. 
\v 8  And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
you word again, as the \nd LORD\nd* shall speak unto me: and the
princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 
\v 9  And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men \add are\add* these with thee?
\v 10  And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
Moab, hath sent unto me, \add saying\add*, 
\v 11 Behold, \add there is\add* a people come out of Egypt, which
covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be
able to overcome them, and drive them out.\f + \fr 22.11  \ft I shall…: Heb. I shall prevail in fighting against
him\f* 
\v 12  And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not
curse the people: for they \add are\add* blessed. 
\v 13  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
of Balak, Get you into your land: for the \nd LORD\nd* refuseth to give me
leave to go with you. 
\v 14  And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak,
and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
\v 16  And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak
the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto
me:\f + \fr 22.16  \ft Let…: Heb. Be not thou hindered from, etc\f*
\v 17  For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will
do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse
me this people. 
\v 18  And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the word of the \nd LORD\nd* my God, to do less or more. 
\v 19  Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night,
that I may know what the \nd LORD\nd* will say unto me more. 
\v 20  And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
men come to call thee, rise up, \add and\add* go with them; but yet
the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
\v 21  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
went with the princes of Moab. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel
of the \nd LORD\nd* stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was
riding upon his ass, and his two servants \add were\add* with him.
\v 23  And the ass saw the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* standing in the
way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the
way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the
way. 
\v 24  But the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stood in a path of the vineyards,
a wall \add being\add* on this side, and a wall on that side. 
\v 25  And when the ass saw the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, she thrust
herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall:
and he smote her again. 
\v 26  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* went further, and stood
in a narrow place, where \add was\add* no way to turn either to the right
hand or to the left. 
\v 27  And when the ass saw the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, she fell
down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the
ass with a staff. 
\v 28  And the \nd LORD\nd* opened the mouth of the ass, and she
said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten
me these three times? 
\v 29  And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
\v 30  And the ass said unto Balaam, \add Am\add* not I thine ass,
upon which thou hast ridden ever since \add I was\add* thine unto this
day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.\f + \fr 22.30 
\ft upon…: Heb. who hast ridden upon me\f*\f + \fr 22.30  \ft ever since…: or, ever since thou wast,
etc\f* 
\v 31  Then the \nd LORD\nd* opened  the eyes of Balaam, and he saw
the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* standing in the way, and his sword
drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his
face.\f + \fr 22.31  \ft fell…: or, bowed himself\f* 
\v 32  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because
\add thy\add* way is perverse before me:\f + \fr 22.32  \ft to…: Heb. to be an adversary unto
thee\f* 
\v 33  And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her
alive. 
\v 34  And Balaam said unto the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, I have
sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against  me: now therefore, if it displease
thee, I will get me back again.\f + \fr 22.34  \ft displease…: Heb. be evil in thine
eyes\f* 
\v 35  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Balaam, Go with the
men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt
speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to
meet him unto a city of Moab, which \add is\add* in the border of
Arnon, which \add is\add* in the utmost coast. 
\v 37  And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to
call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed
to promote thee to honour? 
\v 38  And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any
power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth,
that shall I speak. 
\v 39  And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.\f + \fr 22.39 
\ft Kirjath-huzoth: or, a city of streets\f* 
\v 40  And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
princes that \add were\add* with him. 
\v 41  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam,
and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might
see the utmost \add part\add* of the people. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 
\v 2  And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on
\add every\add* altar a bullock and a ram. 
\v 3  And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will
go: peradventure the \nd LORD\nd* will come to meet me: and whatsoever
he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.\f + \fr 23.3 
\ft to an…: or, solitary\f* 
\v 4  And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
altars, and I have offered upon \add every\add* altar a bullock and a
ram. 
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said,
Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 
\v 6  And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice,
he, and all the princes of Moab. 
\v 7  And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, \add saying\add*,
Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 
\v 8  How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
defy, \add whom\add* the \nd LORD\nd* hath not defied? 
\v 9  For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills
I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
reckoned among the nations. 
\v 10  Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
\add part\add* of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous,
and let my last end be like his!\f + \fr 23.10  \ft me: Heb. my soul, or, my

\v 11  And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed \add them\add*
altogether. 
\v 12  And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the
\nd LORD\nd* hath put in my mouth? 
\p
\v 13  And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another
place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost
part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on
\add every\add* altar.\f + \fr 23.14  \ft Pisgah: or, the hill\f*
\v 15  And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
while I meet \add the \+nd Lord\+nd*\add* yonder. 
\v 16  And the \nd LORD\nd* met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth,
and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. 
\v 17  And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the
\nd LORD\nd* spoken? 
\v 18  And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 
\v 19  God \add is\add* not a man, that he should lie; neither the
son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not
do \add it\add*? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
\v 20  Behold, I have received \add commandment\add* to bless: and he hath
blessed; and I cannot reverse it. 
\v 21  He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
perverseness in Israel: the \nd LORD\nd* his God \add is\add* with him, and the
shout of a king \add is\add* among them. 
\v 22  God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
of an unicorn. 
\v 23 Surely \add there is\add* no enchantment against Jacob, neither
\add is there\add* any divination against Israel: according to this
time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!\f + \fr 23.23

\v 24  Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift

\p
\v 25 ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
bless them at all. 
\v 26  But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
saying, All that the \nd LORD\nd* speaketh, that I must do? 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest
curse me them from thence. 
\v 28  And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
toward Jeshimon. 
\v 29  And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 30  And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
ram on \add every\add* altar. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1  And when Balaam saw that it pleased the \nd LORD\nd* to bless
Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments,
but he set his face toward the wilderness.\f + \fr 24.1  \ft to seek…: Heb. to the meeting

\v 2  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding \add in his

O Israel! 
\v 6  As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s

\v 7  He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed \add shall

\v 8  God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies,
and shall break their bones, and pierce \add them\add* through with his

\v 9  He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him
up? Blessed \add is\add* he that blesseth thee, and cursed \add is\add*
he that curseth thee. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote
his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to
curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed \add them\add*
these three times. 
\v 11  Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
thee unto great honour; but, lo, the \nd LORD\nd* hath kept thee
back from honour. 
\v 12  And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me, saying,

I cannot go beyond the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*, to do \add either\add*

\v 14  And now, behold, I go unto my people: come \add therefore,

\v 25  And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
Balak also went his way. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1  And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of Moab. 
\v 2  And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 
\v 3  And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the

\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
people, and hang them up before the \nd LORD\nd* against the sun,
that the fierce anger of the \nd LORD\nd* may be turned away from

\v 5  And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one

\v 8  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a

\v 36  And the half, \add which was\add* the portion of them that went

\v 48 ¶ And the officers which \add were\add* over thousands of the

\v 1  Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very

\v 2  The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the

\p
\v 6 ¶ And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children
of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
\v 7  And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel
from going over into the land which the \nd LORD\nd* hath given them?\f + \fr 32.7

\v 9  For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not
go into the land which the \nd LORD\nd* had given them. 
\v 10  And the \nd LORD’s\nd* anger was kindled the same time, and he
sware, saying, 
\v 11  Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham,
unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed
me:\f + \fr 32.11  \ft wholly…: Heb. fulfilled after me\f* 
\v 12  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD’s\nd* anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them
wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had
done evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, was consumed. 
\v 14  And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase
of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the \nd LORD\nd*
toward Israel. 
\v 15  For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 
\v 17  But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little
ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants
of the land. 
\v 18  We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 
\v 19  For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan
eastward. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go
armed before the \nd LORD\nd* to war, 
\v 21  And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the \nd LORD\nd*,
until he hath driven out his enemies from before him, 
\v 22  And the land be subdued before the \nd LORD\nd*: then afterward
ye shall return, and be guiltless before the \nd LORD\nd*, and before
Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 23  But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
\nd LORD\nd*: and be sure your sin will find you out. 
\v 24  Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 
\v 25  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 
\v 26  Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 
\v 27  But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
before the \nd LORD\nd* to battle, as my lord saith. 
\p
\v 28  So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the
children of Israel: 
\v 29  And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children
of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle,
before the \nd LORD\nd*, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall
give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 
\v 30  But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 
\v 31  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
saying, As the \nd LORD\nd* hath said unto thy servants, so will we
do. 
\v 32  We will pass over armed before the \nd LORD\nd* into the land
of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan
\add may be\add* ours. 
\v 33  And Moses gave unto them, \add even\add* to the children of
Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the
kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the

\v 39  And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,

\v 40  And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he

\v 41  And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns

smote \add him\add* shall surely be put to death; \add for\add* he
\add is\add* a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer,
when he meeteth him. 
\v 22  But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
upon him any thing without laying of wait, 
\v 23  Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing \add him\add*
not, and cast \add it\add* upon him, that he die, and \add was\add*
not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 
\v 24  Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
revenger of blood according to these judgments: 
\v 25  And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand
of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the
city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the
death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 
\v 26  But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border
of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 
\v 27  And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the
city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of
blood:\f + \fr 35.27  \ft he…: Heb. no blood shall be to him\f* 
\v 28  Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high
priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession. 
\v 29 So these \add things\add* shall be for a statute of judgment
unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
\v 30  Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any
person \add to cause him\add* to die. 
\v 31  Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which
\add is\add* guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.\f + \fr 35.31 
\ft guilty…: Heb. faulty to die\f* 
\v 32  And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land,
until the death of the priest. 
\v 33  So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye \add are:\add*
for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\f + \fr 35.33 
\ft the land cannot…: Heb. there can be no expiation for the land\f*
\v 34  Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein
I dwell: for I the \nd LORD\nd* dwell among the children of Israel.

\v 1  And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead,
the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons
of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes,
the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 
\v 2  And they said, The \nd LORD\nd* commanded my lord to give the
land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my
lord was commanded by the \nd LORD\nd* to give the inheritance of
Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 
\v 3  And if they be married to any of the sons of the \add other\add*
tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be
taken from the lot of our inheritance.\f + \fr 36.3  \ft whereunto…: Heb. unto whom they shall
be\f* 
\v 4  And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their
inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their
inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
fathers.\f + \fr 36.4  \ft whereunto…: Heb. unto whom they shall
be\f* 
\p
\v 5  And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
word of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph
hath said well. 
\v 6 This \add is\add* the thing which the \nd LORD\nd* doth command
concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they
marry.\f + \fr 36.6  \ft marry: Heb. be wives\f* 
\v 7  So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall
keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.\f + \fr 36.7 
\ft keep…: Heb. cleave to the, etc\f* 
\v 8  And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe
of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the
tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every
man the inheritance of his fathers. 
\v 9  Neither shall the inheritance remove from \add one\add* tribe
to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of
Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. 
\v 10  Even as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses, so did the daughters
of Zelophehad: 
\v 11  For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’
sons: 
\v 12  \add And\add* they were married into the families of the sons
of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the
tribe of the family of their father.\f + \fr 36.12  \ft into…: Heb. to some that were of the
families\f* 
\v 13 These \add are\add* the commandments and the judgments, which the
\nd LORD\nd* commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of
Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan \add near\add* Jericho.
