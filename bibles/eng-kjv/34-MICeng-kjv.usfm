\v 1  The word of the \nd LORD\nd* that came to Micah the Morasthite
in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add* Hezekiah, kings of Judah,
which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 
\v 2  Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
is: and let the Lord \nd GOD\nd* be witness against you, the Lord
from his holy temple.\f + \fr 1.2  \ft all ye…: Heb. ye people, all of
them\f*\f + \fr 1.2  \ft all that…: Heb. the fulness thereof\f* 
\v 3  For, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* cometh forth out of his place,
and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
\v 4  And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, \add and\add* as the waters
\add that are\add* poured down a steep place.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft a steep…: Heb. a
descent\f* 
\v 5  For the transgression of Jacob \add is\add* all this, and for the
sins of the house of Israel. What \add is\add* the transgression
of Jacob? \add is it\add* not Samaria? and what \add are\add* the high
places of Judah? \add are they\add* not Jerusalem? 
\v 6  Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, \add and\add*
as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the
valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. 
\v 7  And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the
idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered \add it\add*
of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an
harlot. 
\p
\v 8  Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked:
I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.\f + \fr 1.8 
\ft owls: Heb. daughters of the owl\f* 
\v 9  For her wound \add is\add* incurable; for it is come unto Judah;
he is come unto the gate of my people, \add even\add* to Jerusalem.\f + \fr 1.9 
\ft her…: or, she is grievously sick of her wounds\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Declare ye \add it\add* not at Gath, weep ye not at all:
in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.\f + \fr 1.10  \ft Aphrah: that is,
Dust\f* 
\v 11  Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame
naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of
Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft thou…: or, thou that dwellest
fairly\f*\f + \fr 1.11  \ft inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress\f*\f + \fr 1.11 
\ft Zaanan: or, The country of flocks\f*\f + \fr 1.11  \ft Beth-ezel: or, A place
near\f* 
\v 12  For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but
evil came down from the \nd LORD\nd* unto the gate of Jerusalem.\f + \fr 1.12 
\ft inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress\f*\f + \fr 1.12  \ft waited…: or, was
grieved\f* 
\v 13  O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
beast: she \add is\add* the beginning of the sin to the daughter
of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.\f + \fr 1.13 
\ft inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress\f* 
\v 14  Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the
houses of Achzib \add shall be\add* a lie to the kings of Israel.\f + \fr 1.14 
\ft to…: or, for Moresheth-gath\f*\f + \fr 1.14  \ft Achzib: that is, A
lie\f* 
\v 15  Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.\f + \fr 1.15  \ft inhabitant: Heb.
inhabitress\f*\f + \fr 1.15  \ft he…: or, the glory of Israel shall,
etc\f* 
\v 16  Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge
thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.

\p
\v 1  Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is
in the power of their hand. 
\v 2  And they covet fields, and take \add them\add* by violence;
and houses, and take \add them\add* away: so they oppress a man and his
house, even a man and his heritage.\f + \fr 2.2  \ft oppress: or,
defraud\f* 
\v 3  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; Behold, against this
family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time \add is\add* evil. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ In that day shall \add one\add* take up a parable against you, and
lament with a doleful lamentation, \add and\add* say, We be utterly
spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed
\add it\add* from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.\f + \fr 2.4 
\ft a doleful…: Heb. a lamentation of lamentations\f*\f + \fr 2.4 
\ft turning…: or, instead of restoring\f* 
\v 5  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
in the congregation of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 6  Prophesy ye not, \add say they to them that\add* prophesy:
they shall not prophesy to them, \add that\add* they shall not take
shame.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft Prophesy ye…: or, Prophesy not as they prophesy: Heb. Drop,
etc\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ O \add thou that art\add* named the house of Jacob, is the
spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* straitened? \add are\add* these his doings?
do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?\f + \fr 2.7 
\ft straitened: or, shortened?\f*\f + \fr 2.7  \ft uprightly: Heb.
upright?\f* 
\v 8  Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men
averse from war.\f + \fr 2.8  \ft of late: Heb. yesterday\f*\f + \fr 2.8 
\ft with the: Heb. over against a\f* 
\v 9  The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.\f + \fr 2.9 
\ft women: or, wives\f* 
\v 10  Arise ye, and depart; for this \add is\add* not \add your\add*
rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy \add you\add*, even with a
sore destruction. 
\v 11  If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, \add saying\add*,
I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the
prophet of this people.\f + \fr 2.11  \ft walking…: or, walk with the wind, and lie
falsely\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep
of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great
noise by reason of \add the multitude of\add* men. 
\v 13  The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed
through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass
before them, and the \nd LORD\nd* on the head of them. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
of the house of Israel; \add Is it\add* not for you to know judgment?
\v 2  Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
from off them, and their flesh from off their bones; 
\v 3  Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they
break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as
flesh within the caldron. 
\v 4  Then shall they cry unto the \nd LORD\nd*, but he will not
hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves
ill in their doings. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* concerning the prophets that make my
people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that
putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.
\v 6  Therefore night \add shall be\add* unto you, that ye shall not have a
vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;
and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be
dark over them.\f + \fr 3.6  \ft that…: vision: Heb. from a vision\f*\f + \fr 3.6 
\ft that…: divine: Heb. from divining\f* 
\v 7  Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
yea, they shall all cover their lips; for \add there is\add* no answer
of God.\f + \fr 3.7  \ft lips: Heb. upper lip\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression,
and to Israel his sin. 
\v 9  Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert
all equity. 
\v 10  They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.\f + \fr 3.10 
\ft blood: Heb. bloods\f* 
\v 11  The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they
lean upon the \nd LORD\nd*, and say, \add Is\add* not the \nd LORD\nd*
among us? none evil can come upon us.\f + \fr 3.11  \ft and say: Heb.
saying\f* 
\v 12  Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed \add as\add*
a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the
house as the high places of the forest. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  But in the last days it shall come to pass, \add that\add*
the mountain of the house of the \nd LORD\nd* shall be established
in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills;
and people shall flow unto it. 
\v 2  And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
to the mountain of the \nd LORD\nd*, and to the house of the God
of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
from Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations
afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft pruninghooks: or,
scythes\f* 
\v 4  But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
tree; and none shall make \add them\add* afraid: for the mouth of the
\nd LORD\nd* of hosts hath spoken \add it\add*. 
\v 5  For all people will walk every one in the name of his god,
and we will walk in the name of the \nd LORD\nd* our God for ever
and ever. 
\v 6  In that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, will I assemble her that
halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have
afflicted; 
\v 7  And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far
off a strong nation: and the \nd LORD\nd* shall reign over them in
mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter
of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom
shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
\v 9  Now why dost thou cry out aloud? \add is there\add* no king
in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in
travail. 
\v 10  Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city,
and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go \add even\add*
to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the \nd LORD\nd*
shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say,
Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. 
\v 12  But they know not the thoughts of the \nd LORD\nd*, neither
understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves
into the floor. 
\v 13  Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine
horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in
pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a
rod upon the cheek. 
\v 2  But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, \add though\add* thou be little
among the thousands of Judah, \add yet\add* out of thee shall he come
forth unto me \add that is\add* to be ruler in Israel; whose goings
forth \add have been\add* from of old, from everlasting.\f + \fr 5.2 
\ft everlasting: Heb. the days of eternity\f* 
\v 3  Therefore will he give them up, until the time \add that\add*
she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the \nd LORD\nd*,
in the majesty of the name of the \nd LORD\nd* his God; and they shall
abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\f + \fr 5.4 
\ft feed: or, rule\f* 
\v 5 And this \add man\add* shall be the peace, when the Assyrian
shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces,
then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal
men.\f + \fr 5.5  \ft principal: Heb. princes of\f* 
\v 6  And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the
land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver \add us\add*
from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth
within our borders.\f + \fr 5.6  \ft waste: Heb. eat up\f*\f + \fr 5.6 
\ft in the…: or, with her own naked swords\f* 
\p
\v 7  And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people
as a dew from the \nd LORD\nd*, as the showers upon the grass, that
tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the
midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young
lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth
down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.\f + \fr 5.8  \ft sheep: or,
goats\f* 
\v 9  Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine
enemies shall be cut off. 
\v 10  And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will
destroy thy chariots: 
\v 11  And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down
all thy strong holds: 
\v 12  And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no
\add more\add* soothsayers: 
\v 13  Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images
out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work
of thine hands.\f + \fr 5.13  \ft standing…: or, statues\f* 
\v 14  And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I
destroy thy cities.\f + \fr 5.14  \ft cities: or, enemies\f* 
\v 15  And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen,
such as they have not heard. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Hear ye now what the \nd LORD\nd* saith; Arise, contend thou before the
mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.\f + \fr 6.1  \ft before: or,
with\f* 
\v 2  Hear ye, O mountains, the \nd LORD’s\nd* controversy, and ye
strong foundations of the earth: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath a controversy
with his people, and he will plead with Israel. 
\v 3  O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
wearied thee? testify against me. 
\v 4  For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses,
Aaron, and Miriam. 
\v 5  O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal;
that ye may know the righteousness of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Wherewith shall I come before the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add*
bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt
offerings, with calves of a year old?\f + \fr 6.6  \ft of a…: Heb. sons of a
year?\f* 
\v 7  Will the \nd LORD\nd* be pleased with thousands of rams, \add or\add*
with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn \add for\add*
my transgression, the fruit of my body \add for\add* the sin of my
soul?\f + \fr 6.7  \ft body: Heb. belly\f* 
\v 8  He hath shewed thee, O man, what \add is\add* good; and what doth the
\nd LORD\nd* require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?\f + \fr 6.8  \ft walk…: Heb. humble thyself to
walk\f* 
\p
\v 9  The \nd LORD’s\nd* voice crieth unto the city, and \add the man
of\add* wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath
appointed it.\f + \fr 6.9  \ft the man…: or, thy name shall see that which
is\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
wicked, and the scant measure \add that is\add* abominable?\f + \fr 6.10 
\ft Are…: or, Is there yet unto every man an house of the, etc\f*\f + \fr 6.10 
\ft scant…: Heb. measure of leanness\f* 
\v 11 Shall I count \add them\add* pure with the wicked balances,
and with the bag of deceitful weights?\f + \fr 6.11  \ft count…: or, be pure with,
etc\f* 
\v 12  For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants
thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue \add is\add* deceitful
in their mouth. 
\v 13 Therefore also will I make \add thee\add* sick in smiting thee, in making
\add thee\add* desolate because of thy sins. 
\v 14  Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
\add shall be\add* in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold,
but shalt not deliver; and \add that\add* which thou deliverest will I give
up to the sword. 
\v 15  Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread
the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine,
but shalt not drink wine. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the
house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make
thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall
bear the reproach of my people.\f + \fr 6.16  \ft For the…: or, For he doth much keep the,
etc\f*\f + \fr 6.16  \ft desolation: or, astonishment\f* 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,
as the grapegleanings of the vintage: \add there is\add* no cluster
to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.\f + \fr 7.1  \ft when…: Heb. the gatherings of
summer\f* 
\v 2  The good \add man\add* is perished out of the earth: and \add there
is\add* none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they
hunt every man his brother with a net.\f + \fr 7.2  \ft good: or, godly, or,
merciful\f* 
\p
\v 3 ¶ That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
asketh, and the judge \add asketh\add* for a reward; and the great
\add man\add*, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it
up.\f + \fr 7.3  \ft his…: Heb. the mischief of his soul\f* 
\v 4  The best of them \add is\add* as a brier: the most upright
\add is sharper\add* than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen
\add and\add* thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
\p
\v 5 ¶ Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
\v 6  For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law;
a man’s enemies \add are\add* the men of his own house. 
\p
\v 7  Therefore I will look unto the \nd LORD\nd*; I will wait for the
God of my salvation: my God will hear me. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall
arise; when I sit in darkness, the \nd LORD\nd* \add shall be\add*
a light unto me. 
\v 9  I will bear the indignation of the \nd LORD\nd*, because I have
sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment
for me: he will bring me forth to the light, \add and\add* I shall
behold his righteousness. 
\v 10 Then \add she that is\add* mine enemy shall see \add it\add*,
and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down
as the mire of the streets.\f + \fr 7.10  \ft Then…: or, And thou wilt see her that is mine enemy, and cover her with
shame\f*\f + \fr 7.10  \ft shall she…: Heb. she shall be for a treading
down\f* 
\v 11  \add In\add* the day that thy walls are to be built, \add in\add*
that day shall the decree be far removed. 
\v 12  \add In\add* that day \add also\add* he shall come even to thee from
Assyria, and \add from\add* the fortified cities, and from the fortress
even to the river, and from sea to sea, and \add from\add* mountain
to mountain.\f + \fr 7.12  \ft and from the fortified cities: or, even to the fortified
cities\f* 
\v 13  Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that
dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.\f + \fr 7.13  \ft Notwithstanding: or, After that it hath
been\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
which dwell solitarily \add in\add* the wood, in the midst of Carmel:
let them feed \add in\add* Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.\f + \fr 7.14 
\ft Feed: or, Rule\f* 
\v 15  According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
will I shew unto him marvellous \add things\add*. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:
they shall lay \add their\add* hand upon \add their\add* mouth, their
ears shall be deaf. 
\v 17  They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their
holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the \nd LORD\nd*
our God, and shall fear because of thee.\f + \fr 7.17  \ft worms: or, creeping
things\f* 
\v 18 Who \add is\add* a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity,
and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth \add in\add*
mercy. 
\v 19  He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the
depths of the sea. 
\v 20  Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, \add and\add* the mercy
to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days
of old.
