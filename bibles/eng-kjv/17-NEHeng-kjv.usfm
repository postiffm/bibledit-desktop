\v 1  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the
month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
\v 2  That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and \add certain\add*
men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
\v 3  And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
there in the province \add are\add* in great affliction and reproach:
the wall of Jerusalem also \add is\add* broken down, and the gates
thereof are burned with fire. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat
down and wept, and mourned \add certain\add* days, and fasted, and
prayed before the God of heaven, 
\p
\v 5  And said, I beseech thee, O \nd LORD\nd* God of heaven, the
great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
love him and observe his commandments: 
\v 6  Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest
hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day
and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the
sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my
father’s house have sinned. 
\v 7  We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou
commandedst thy servant Moses. 
\v 8  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
servant Moses, saying, \add If\add* ye transgress, I will scatter you
abroad among the nations: 
\v 9 But \add if\add* ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments,
and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost
part of the heaven, \add yet\add* will I gather them from thence, and will
bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
\v 10 Now these \add are\add* thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
\v 11  O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire
to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day,
and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s
cupbearer. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
of Artaxerxes the king, \add that\add* wine \add was\add* before
him: and I took up the wine, and gave \add it\add* unto the king. Now I had not been
\add beforetime\add* sad in his presence. 
\v 2  Wherefore the king said unto me, Why \add is\add* thy countenance
sad, seeing thou \add art\add* not sick? this \add is\add* nothing
\add else\add* but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
\v 3  And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my
countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres,
\add lieth\add* waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
\v 4  Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
\v 5  And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto
Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.
\v 6  And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it
pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft queen: Heb.
wife\f* 
\v 7  Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters
be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me
over till I come into Judah; 
\v 8  And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may
give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which \add appertained\add*
to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter
into. And the king granted  me, according to the good hand of my
God upon me. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the
king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
\v 10  When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
heard \add of it\add*, it grieved them exceedingly that there was
come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. 
\v 11  So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
told I \add any\add* man what my God had put in my heart to do at
Jerusalem: neither \add was there any\add* beast with me, save the
beast that I rode upon. 
\v 13  And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,
which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with
fire. 
\v 14  Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s
pool: but \add there was\add* no place for the beast \add that was\add*
under me to pass. 
\v 15  Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and \add so\add*
returned. 
\v 16  And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as
yet told \add it\add* to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the
nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we \add are\add*
in, how Jerusalem \add lieth\add* waste, and the gates thereof are
burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem,
that we be no more a reproach. 
\v 18  Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the
king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise
up and build. So they strengthened their hands for \add this\add*
good \add work\add*. 
\v 19  But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard \add it\add*, they laughed us to
scorn, and despised us, and said, What \add is\add* this thing that ye
do? will ye rebel against the king? 
\v 20  Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build:
but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

\p
\v 1  Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set
up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the
tower of Hananeel. 
\v 2  And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
builded Zaccur the son of Imri.\f + \fr 3.2  \ft next unto…: Heb. at his
hand\f* 
\v 3  But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who \add also\add*
laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the
bars thereof. 
\v 4  And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the
son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah,
the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son
of Baana. 
\v 5  And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles
put not their necks to the work of their Lord. 
\v 6  Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah,
and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set
up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
\v 7  And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon
the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne
of the governor on this side the river. 
\v 8  Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths.
Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of \add one of\add*
the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.\f + \fr 3.8 
\ft fortified…: or, left Jerusalem unto the broad wall\f* 
\v 9  And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler
of the half part of Jerusalem. 
\v 10  And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his
house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah.
\v 11  Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath-moab,
repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.\f + \fr 3.11 
\ft other…: Heb. second measure\f* 
\v 12  And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the
ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. 
\v 13  The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the
bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate.
\v 14  But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the
ruler of part of Beth-haccerem; he built it, and set up the doors
thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. 
\v 15  But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh,
the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set
up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the
wall of the pool of Siloah by the king’s garden, and unto the stairs
that go down from the city of David. 
\v 16  After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
half part of Beth-zur, unto \add the place\add* over against the
sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the
house of the mighty. 
\v 17  After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto
him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his
part. 
\v 18  After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,
the ruler of the half part of Keilah. 
\v 19  And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler
of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury
at the turning \add of the wall\add*. 
\v 20  After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the
other piece, from the turning \add of the wall\add* unto the door
of the house of Eliashib the high priest.\f + \fr 3.20  \ft Zabbai: also called,
Zaccai\f* 
\v 21  After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz
another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the
end of the house of Eliashib. 
\v 22  And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.
\v 23  After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of
Ananiah by his house. 
\v 24  After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,
from the house of Azariah unto the turning \add of the wall\add*,
even unto the corner. 
\v 25  Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning \add of the
wall\add*, and the tower which lieth out from the king’s high house, that
\add was\add* by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son
of Parosh. 
\v 26  Moreover the Nethinims dwelt  in Ophel, unto \add the place\add*
over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth
out.\f + \fr 3.26  \ft dwelt…: or, which dwelt in Ophel, repaired
unto\f*\f + \fr 3.26  \ft Ophel: or, tower\f* 
\v 27  After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the
great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel. 
\v 28  From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one
over against his house. 
\v 29  After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his

\v 30  After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun
the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam
the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. 
\v 31  After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith’s son unto the place
of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad,
and to the going up of the corner.\f + \fr 3.31  \ft going…: or, corner
chamber\f* 
\v 32  And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.\f + \fr 3.32  \ft going…: or, corner
chamber\f* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the
Jews. 
\v 2  And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they
sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones
out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?\f + \fr 4.2  \ft fortify…: Heb. leave to
themselves\f* 
\v 3  Now Tobiah the Ammonite \add was\add* by him, and he said,
Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down
their stone wall. 
\v 4  Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:\f + \fr 4.4 
\ft despised: Heb. despite\f* 
\v 5  And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted
out from before thee: for they have provoked \add thee\add* to anger
before the builders. 
\v 6  So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ But it came to pass, \add that\add* when Sanballat, and Tobiah,
and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the
walls of Jerusalem were made up, \add and\add* that the breaches
began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, \f + \fr 4.7  \ft were made up: Heb.
ascended\f* 
\v 8  And conspired all of them together to come \add and\add* to
fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.\f + \fr 4.8  \ft to hinder…: Heb. to make an error to
it\f* 
\v 9  Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
against them day and night, because of them. 
\v 10  And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
decayed, and \add there is\add* much rubbish; so that we are not
able to build the wall. 
\v 11  And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the
work to cease. 
\v 12  And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall
return unto us \add they will be upon you\add*.\f + \fr 4.12  \ft From all…: or, That from all places ye must return to
us\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, \add and\add*
on the higher places, I even set the people after their families
with their swords, their spears, and their bows.\f + \fr 4.13  \ft in the…: Heb. from the lower parts of the place,
etc\f* 
\v 14  And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:
remember  the Lord, \add which is\add* great and terrible, and fight
for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your
houses. 
\v 15  And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned
all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. 
\p
\v 16  And it came to pass from that time forth, \add that\add* the
half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them
held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons;
and the rulers \add were\add* behind all the house of Judah. 
\v 17  They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
with those that laded, \add every one\add* with one of his hands
wrought in the work, and with the other \add hand\add* held a weapon.
\v 18  For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and
\add so\add* builded. And he that sounded the trumpet \add was\add*
by me.\f + \fr 4.18  \ft by his side: Heb. on his loins\f* 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the
rest of the people, The work \add is\add* great and large, and we are
separated upon the wall, one far from another. 
\v 20  In what place \add therefore\add* ye hear the sound of the
trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. 
\v 21  So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. 
\v 22  Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
one with his servant lodge  within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a
guard to us, and labour on the day. 
\v 23  So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men
of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, \add saving
that\add* every one put them off for washing.\f + \fr 4.23  \ft saving…: or, every one went with his weapon for
water\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
against their brethren the Jews. 
\v 2  For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,
\add are\add* many: therefore we take up corn \add for them\add*,
that we may eat, and live. 
\v 3  \add Some\add* also there were that said, We have mortgaged
our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
dearth. 
\v 4  There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s
tribute, \add and that upon\add* our lands and vineyards. 
\v 5  Yet now our flesh \add is\add* as the flesh of our brethren,
our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
sons and our daughters to be servants, and \add some\add* of our
daughters are brought unto bondage \add already:\add* neither \add is
it\add* in our power \add to redeem them;\add* for other men have our
lands and vineyards. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\v 7  Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.
And I set a great assembly against them.\f + \fr 5.7  \ft I consulted…: Heb. my heart consulted in
me\f* 
\v 8  And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even
sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their
peace, and found nothing \add to answer\add*. 
\v 9  Also I said, It \add is\add* not good that ye do: ought ye not to
walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
our enemies? 
\v 10 I likewise, \add and\add* my brethren, and my servants, might
exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
\v 11  Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth
\add part\add* of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil,
that ye exact of them. 
\v 12  Then said they, We will restore \add them\add*, and will require
nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this
promise. 
\v 13  Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man
from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise,
even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation
said, Amen, and praised the \nd LORD\nd*. And the people did according to this
promise.\f + \fr 5.13  \ft emptied: Heb. empty, or, void\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, \add that is\add*, twelve
years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\v 15  But the former governors that \add had been\add* before me were
chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine,
beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule
over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. 
\v 16  Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
we any land: and all my servants \add were\add* gathered thither unto the
work. 
\v 17 Moreover \add there were\add* at my table an hundred and fifty
of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the
heathen that \add are\add* about us. 
\v 18 Now \add that\add* which was prepared \add for me\add* daily
\add was\add* one ox \add and\add* six choice sheep; also fowls were
prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine:
yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the
bondage was heavy upon this people. 
\v 19  Think upon me, my God, for good, \add according\add* to all that I have
done for this people. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem
the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded
the wall, and \add that\add* there was no breach left therein; (though
at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 
\v 2  That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
meet together in \add some one of\add* the villages in the plain
of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. 
\v 3  And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I \add am\add* doing
a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
whilst I leave it, and come down to you? 
\v 4  Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered
them after the same manner. 
\v 5  Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
\v 6 Wherein \add was\add* written, It is reported among the heathen,
and Gashmu saith \add it, that\add* thou and the Jews think to rebel:
for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
king, according to these words.\f + \fr 6.6  \ft Gashmu: also called,
Geshem\f* 
\v 7  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
Jerusalem, saying, \add There is\add* a king in Judah: and now shall it be
reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take
counsel together. 
\v 8  Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done
as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
\v 9  For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened
from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, \add O God\add*,
strengthen my hands. 
\p
\v 10  Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
the son of Mehetabeel, who \add was\add* shut up; and he said, Let us meet
together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut
the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the
night will they come to slay thee. 
\v 11  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who \add is there\add*, that,
\add being\add* as I \add am\add*, would go into the temple to save his
life? I will not go in. 
\v 12  And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had
hired him. 
\v 13 Therefore \add was\add* he hired, that I should be afraid,
and do so, and sin, and \add that\add* they might have \add matter\add*
for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 
\v 14  My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their
works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets,
that would have put me in fear. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth \add day\add* of
\add the month\add* Elul, in fifty and two days. 
\v 16  And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard \add thereof\add*,
and all the heathen that \add were\add* about us saw \add these things\add*,
they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this
work was wrought of our God. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
unto Tobiah, and \add the letters\add* of Tobiah came unto them.\f + \fr 6.17 
\ft sent…: Heb. multiplied their letters passing to Tobiah\f* 
\v 18 For \add there were\add* many in Judah sworn unto him, because he
\add was\add* the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his
son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
\v 19  Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
words to him. \add And\add* Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.\f + \fr 6.19 
\ft words: or, matters\f* 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set
up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were
appointed, 
\v 2  That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
palace, charge  over Jerusalem: for he \add was\add* a faithful man,
and feared God above many. 
\v 3  And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the
doors, and bar \add them:\add* and appoint watches of the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one \add to be\add*
over against his house. 
\v 4  Now the city \add was\add* large and great: but the people
\add were\add* few therein, and the houses \add were\add* not builded.\f + \fr 7.4 
\ft large: Heb. broad in spaces\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.
And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the
first, and found written therein, 
\v 6 These \add are\add* the children of the province, that went
up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again
to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them
light, and the way wherein they should go. 
\v 20  Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest

\v 12  And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the

\p
\v 27 ¶ And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought
the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with
singing, \add with\add* cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
\v 28  And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together,
both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the
villages of Netophathi; 
\v 29  Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about
Jerusalem. 
\v 30  And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified
the people, and the gates, and the wall. 
\v 31  Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
appointed two great \add companies of them that gave\add* thanks,
\add whereof one\add* went on the right hand upon the wall toward the
dung gate: 
\v 32  And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
\v 33  And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

\v 35 And \add certain\add* of the priests’ sons with trumpets; \add namely\add*,

the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: 
\v 36  And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai,
Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments
of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 
\v 37  And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went
up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall,
above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. 
\v 38  And the other \add company of them that gave\add* thanks went
over against \add them\add*, and I after them, and the half of the
people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the
broad wall; 
\v 39  And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower
of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison
gate. 
\v 40  So stood the two \add companies of them that gave\add* thanks
in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 
\v 41  And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai,

\v 43  Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced:
for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the
children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar
off. 
\p
\v 44 ¶ And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes,
to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions
of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the
priests and for the Levites that waited.\f + \fr 12.44  \ft of the law: that is, appointed by the

\v 45  And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their
God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment
of David, \add and\add* of Solomon his son. 
\v 46  For in the days of David and Asaph of old \add there were\add*
chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
\v 47  And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days
of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every
day his portion: and they sanctified \add holy things\add* unto the
Levites; and the Levites sanctified \add them\add* unto the children
of Aaron.\f + \fr 12.47  \ft sanctified: that is, set apart\f* 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience
of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the
Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;\f + \fr 13.1 
\ft they…: Heb. there was read\f*\f + \fr 13.1  \ft audience: Heb.

\v 2  Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with
water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our
God turned the curse into a blessing. 
\v 3  Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
separated from Israel all the mixed multitude. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight
of the chamber of the house of our God, \add was\add* allied unto
Tobiah:\f + \fr 13.4  \ft having…: Heb. being set over\f* 
\v 5  And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels,
and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was
commanded \add to be given\add* to the Levites, and the singers,
and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.\f + \fr 13.5 
\ft which…: Heb. the commandment of the Levites\f* 
\v 6 But in all this \add time\add* was not I at Jerusalem: for in the

\ft after…: Heb. at the end of days\f*\f + \fr 13.6  \ft obtained…: or, I earnestly

\v 7  And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib
did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house
of God. 
\v 8  And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 
\v 9  Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I
again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the
frankincense. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
given \add them:\add* for the Levites and the singers, that did the
work, were fled every one to his field. 
\v 11  Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their
place.\f + \fr 13.11  \ft place: Heb. standing\f* 
\v 12  Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
and the oil unto the treasuries.\f + \fr 13.12  \ft treasuries: or,

\v 13  And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them
\add was\add* Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were
counted faithful, and their office \add was\add* to distribute unto their

\p
\v 15 ¶ In those days saw I in Judah \add some\add* treading  wine
presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses;
as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all \add manner of\add* burdens,
which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
\add against them\add* in the day wherein they sold victuals. 
\v 16  There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish,
and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
\v 17  Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What
evil thing \add is\add* this that ye do, and profane the sabbath
day? 
\v 18  Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel
by profaning the sabbath. 
\v 19  And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be
dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut,
and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and
\add some\add* of my servants set I at the gates, \add that\add*
there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. 
\v 20  So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
Jerusalem once or twice. 
\v 21  Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
ye about the wall? if ye do \add so\add* again, I will lay hands
on you. From that time forth came they no \add more\add* on the sabbath.\f + \fr 13.21

\v 22  And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and

\add saying\add*, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.\f + \fr 13.25

\v 26  Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among

and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did
outlandish women cause to sin. 
\v 27  Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil,
to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives? 
\v 28 And \add one\add* of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib
the high priest, \add was\add* son in law to Sanballat the Horonite:
therefore I chased him from me. 
\v 29  Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood,
and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.\f + \fr 13.29 
\ft because…: Heb. for the defilings\f* 
\v 30  Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
