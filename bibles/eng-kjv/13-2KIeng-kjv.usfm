\v 1  Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\v 2  And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that
\add was\add* in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall
recover of this disease. 
\v 3  But the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said to Elijah the Tishbite,
Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,
\add Is it\add* not because \add there is\add* not a God in Israel,
\add that\add* ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? 
\v 4  Now therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Thou shalt not come
down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
And Elijah departed.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft Thou shalt…: Heb. The bed whither thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from
it\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye
now turned back? 
\v 6  And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say
unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, \add Is it\add* not because
\add there is\add* not a God in Israel, \add that\add* thou sendest
to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come
down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
\v 7  And he said unto them, What manner of man \add was he\add*
which came up to meet you, and told you these words?\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft What…: Heb. What was the manner of the man\f* 
\v 8  And they answered him, \add He was\add* an hairy man, and girt
with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It \add is\add*
Elijah the Tishbite. 
\p
\v 9  Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill.
And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come
down. 
\v 10  And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I
\add be\add* a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and
consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven,
and consumed him and his fifty. 
\v 11  Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the
king said, Come down quickly. 
\v 12  And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I \add be\add*
a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his
fifty. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his
knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of
God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants,
be precious in thy sight.\f + \fr 1.13  \ft fell: Heb. bowed\f* 
\v 14  Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the
two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my
life now be precious in thy sight. 
\v 15  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Elijah, Go down
with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the
king. 
\v 16  And he said unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Forasmuch as thou hast
sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, \add is
it\add* not because \add there is\add* no God in Israel to enquire
of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone
up, but shalt surely die. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ So he died according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd* which
Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned  in his stead in the second
year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no
son. 
\v 18  Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when the \nd LORD\nd* would take up Elijah
into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\v 2  And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
\nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said \add unto him,
As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, and \add as\add* thy soul liveth,
I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el. 
\v 3  And the sons of the prophets that \add were\add* at Beth-el
came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the \nd LORD\nd*
will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
know \add it;\add* hold ye your peace. 
\v 4  And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
\nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, \add As\add* the
\nd LORD\nd* liveth, and \add as\add* thy soul liveth, I will not
leave thee. So they came to Jericho. 
\v 5  And the sons of the prophets that \add were\add* at Jericho
came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the \nd LORD\nd*
will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered,
Yea, I know \add it;\add* hold ye your peace. 
\v 6  And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
\nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, \add As\add* the
\nd LORD\nd* liveth, and \add as\add* thy soul liveth, I will not
leave thee. And they two went on. 
\v 7  And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.\f + \fr 2.7  \ft to view: Heb. in sight, or, over
against\f* 
\v 8  And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped \add it\add* together,
and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they
two went over on dry ground. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken
away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion
of thy spirit be upon me. 
\v 10  And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: \add nevertheless\add*,
if thou see me \add when I am\add* taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be
\add so\add*.\f + \fr 2.10  \ft Thou hast…: Heb. Thou hast done hard in
asking\f* 
\v 11  And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,
\add there appeared\add* a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and
parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Elisha saw \add it\add*, and he cried, My father, my
father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw
him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in
two pieces. 
\p
\v 13  He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;\f + \fr 2.13  \ft bank: Heb.
lip\f* 
\v 14  And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
the waters, and said, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and
Elisha went over. 
\v 15  And when the sons of the prophets which \add were\add* to view at
Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.
And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master:
lest peradventure the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* hath taken him up,
and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said,
Ye shall not send.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft strong…: Heb. sons of strength\f*\f + \fr 2.16 
\ft some mountain: Heb. one of the mountains\f* 
\v 17  And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
\v 18  And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the
situation of this city \add is\add* pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the
water \add is\add* naught, and the ground barren.\f + \fr 2.19  \ft barren: Heb. causing to
miscarry\f* 
\v 20  And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
brought \add it\add* to him. 
\v 21  And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast
the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I have
healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death
or barren \add land\add*. 
\v 22  So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
saying of Elisha which he spake. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going
up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up,
thou bald head. 
\v 24  And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
name of the \nd LORD\nd*. And there came forth two she bears out of the
wood, and tare forty and two children of them. 
\v 25  And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
returned to Samaria. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve
years. 
\v 2  And he wrought evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*; but not like his
father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his
father had made.\f + \fr 3.2  \ft image: Heb. statue\f* 
\v 3  Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the
king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand
rams, with the wool. 
\v 5  But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
rebelled against the king of Israel. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered
all Israel. 
\v 7  And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against
Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I \add am\add* as thou
\add art\add*, my people as thy people, \add and\add* my horses as thy
horses. 
\v 8  And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
way through the wilderness of Edom. 
\v 9  So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey:
and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed
them.\f + \fr 3.9  \ft that…: Heb. at their feet\f* 
\v 10  And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the \nd LORD\nd* hath
called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand
of Moab! 
\v 11  But Jehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a prophet
of the \nd LORD\nd*, that we may enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* by him? And
one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here \add is\add*
Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\v 12  And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the \nd LORD\nd* is with him. So the
king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\v 13  And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?
get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy
mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the \nd LORD\nd*
hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the
hand of Moab. 
\v 14  And Elisha said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts liveth,
before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence
of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor
see thee. 
\v 15  But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
minstrel played, that the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* came upon him.
\v 16  And he said, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Make this valley
full of ditches. 
\v 17  For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye
see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may
drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. 
\v 18 And this is \add but\add* a light thing in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. 
\v 19  And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and
mar every good piece of land with stones.\f + \fr 3.19  \ft mar: Heb.
grieve\f* 
\p
\v 20  And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering
was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the
country was filled with water. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come
up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put
on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.\f + \fr 3.21  \ft gathered: Heb. were cried
together\f*\f + \fr 3.21  \ft put on…: Heb. gird himself with a girdle\f*
\v 22  And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side \add as\add*
red as blood: 
\v 23  And they said, This \add is\add* blood: the kings are surely
slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
spoil.\f + \fr 3.23  \ft slain: Heb. destroyed\f* 
\v 24  And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went
forward smiting the Moabites, even in \add their\add* country.\f + \fr 3.24 
\ft they went…: or, they smote in it even smiting\f* 
\v 25  And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the
wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth
left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about \add it\add*,
and smote it.\f + \fr 3.25  \ft only in…: Heb. until he left its stones in
Kir-haraseth\f* 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore
for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break
through \add even\add* unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
\v 27  Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and
offered him \add for\add* a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was
great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and
returned to \add their own\add* land. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou
knowest that thy servant did fear the \nd LORD\nd*: and the creditor
is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 
\v 2  And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what
hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the
house, save a pot of oil. 
\v 3  Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
\add even\add* empty vessels; borrow not a few.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft borrow not…: or, scant
not\f* 
\v 4  And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy
sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set
aside that which is full. 
\v 5  So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
sons, who brought \add the vessels\add* to her; and she poured out.
\v 6  And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, \add There
is\add* not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. 
\v 7  Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the
rest.\f + \fr 4.7  \ft debt: or, creditor\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where
\add was\add* a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And
\add so\add* it was, \add that\add* as oft as he passed by, he turned
in thither to eat bread.\f + \fr 4.8  \ft it fell on a day: Heb. there was a
day\f*\f + \fr 4.8  \ft constrained him: Heb. laid hold on him\f*
\v 9  And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this
\add is\add* an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.
\v 10  Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us
set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick:
and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
\v 11  And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned
into the chamber, and lay there. 
\v 12  And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had
called her, she stood before him. 
\v 13  And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
careful for us with all this care; what \add is\add* to be done for thee?
wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the
host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 
\v 14  And he said, What then \add is\add* to be done for her? And
Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
\v 15  And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
in the door. 
\v 16  And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, \add thou\add*
man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.\f + \fr 4.16  \ft season: Heb. set
time\f* 
\v 17  And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went
out to his father to the reapers. 
\v 19  And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said
to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 
\v 20  And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother,
he sat on her knees till noon, and \add then\add* died. 
\v 21  And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
and shut \add the door\add* upon him, and went out. 
\v 22  And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,
one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the
man of God, and come again. 
\v 23  And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? \add it
is\add* neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, \add It shall
be\add* well.\f + \fr 4.23  \ft well: Heb. peace\f* 
\v 24  Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
forward; slack not \add thy\add* riding for me, except I bid thee.\f + \fr 4.24 
\ft slack…: Heb. restrain not for me to ride\f* 
\v 25  So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.
And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he
said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, \add yonder is\add* that Shunammite:
\v 26  Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, \add Is
it\add* well with thee? \add is it\add* well with thy husband? \add is
it\add* well with the child? And she answered, \add It is\add* well.
\v 27  And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the
man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul \add is\add* vexed within her: and the
\nd LORD\nd* hath hid \add it\add* from me, and hath not told me.\f + \fr 4.27 
\ft him…: Heb. by his feet\f*\f + \fr 4.27  \ft vexed: Heb. bitter\f*
\v 28  Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
Do not deceive me? 
\v 29  Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if
any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the
face of the child. 
\v 30  And the mother of the child said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
liveth, and \add as\add* thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he
arose, and followed her. 
\v 31  And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
face of the child; but \add there was\add* neither voice, nor hearing.
Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child
is not awaked.\f + \fr 4.31  \ft hearing: Heb. attention\f* 
\v 32  And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child
was dead, \add and\add* laid upon his bed. 
\v 33  He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
prayed unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 34  And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth
upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the
child waxed warm. 
\v 35  Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times,
and the child opened his eyes.\f + \fr 4.35  \ft to and fro: Heb. once hither and once
thither\f* 
\v 36  And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy
son. 
\v 37  Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
ground, and took up her son, and went out. 
\p
\v 38 ¶ And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and \add there was\add*
a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets \add were\add*
sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great
pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. 
\v 39  And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found
a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came
and shred \add them\add* into the pot of pottage: for they knew \add them\add* not.
\v 40  So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were
eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O \add thou\add*
man of God, \add there is\add* death in the pot. And they could not
eat \add thereof\add*. 
\v 41  But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast \add it\add* into the
pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no
harm in the pot.\f + \fr 4.41  \ft harm: Heb. evil thing\f* 
\p
\v 42 ¶ And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the
man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of
corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may
eat.\f + \fr 4.42  \ft the husk…: or, his scrip, or, garment\f* 
\v 43  And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred
men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd*, They shall eat, and shall leave \add thereof\add*.
\v 44  So he set \add it\add* before them, and they did eat, and
left \add thereof\add*, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the \nd LORD\nd*
had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour,
\add but he was\add* a leper.\f + \fr 5.1  \ft with: Heb. before\f*\f + \fr 5.1 
\ft honourable: or, gracious: Heb. lifted up, or, accepted in countenance\f*\f + \fr 5.1 
\ft deliverance: or, victory\f* 
\v 2  And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on
Naaman’s wife.\f + \fr 5.2  \ft waited…: Heb. was before\f* 
\v 3  And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord \add were\add*
with the prophet that \add is\add* in Samaria! for he would recover
him of his leprosy.\f + \fr 5.3  \ft with: Heb. before\f*\f + \fr 5.3 
\ft recover: Heb. gather in\f* 
\v 4 And \add one\add* went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus
said the maid that \add is\add* of the land of Israel. 
\v 5  And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents
of silver, and six thousand \add pieces\add* of gold, and ten changes
of raiment.\f + \fr 5.5  \ft with…: Heb. in his hand\f* 
\v 6  And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this
letter is come unto thee, behold, I have \add therewith\add* sent
Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
\v 7  And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
that he rent his clothes, and said, \add Am\add* I God, to kill and to make
alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?
wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And it was \add so\add*, when Elisha the man of God had heard
that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the
king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come
now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 
\p
\v 9  So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
at the door of the house of Elisha. 
\v 10  And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash
in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be
clean. 
\v 11  But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the
\nd LORD\nd* his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover
the leper.\f + \fr 5.11  \ft I thought: Heb. I said\f*\f + \fr 5.11

\v 12  \add Are\add* not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better
than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?
So he turned and went away in a rage.\f + \fr 5.12  \ft Abana: or,
Amana\f* 
\v 13  And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said,
My father, \add if\add* the prophet had bid thee \add do some\add*
great thing, wouldest thou not have done \add it\add*? how much rather
then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? 
\v 14  Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again
like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company,
and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that
\add there is\add* no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee,
take a blessing of thy servant. 
\v 16  But he said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, before
whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take \add it;\add*
but he refused. 
\v 17  And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth
offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 18  In this thing the \nd LORD\nd* pardon thy servant, \add that\add*
when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow
down myself in the house of Rimmon, the \nd LORD\nd* pardon thy servant
in this thing. 
\v 19  And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
little way.\f + \fr 5.19  \ft a little…: Heb. a little piece of ground\f*
\p
\v 20 ¶ But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my
master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands
that which he brought: but, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth,
I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. 
\v 21  So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw \add him\add*
running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and
said, \add Is\add* all well?\f + \fr 5.21  \ft Is…: Heb. Is there
peace?\f* 
\v 22  And he said, All \add is\add* well. My master hath sent me,
saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two
young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a
talent of silver, and two changes of garments. 
\v 23  And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes
of garments, and laid \add them\add* upon two of his servants; and they
bare \add them\add* before him. 
\v 24  And when he came to the tower, he took \add them\add* from their
hand, and bestowed \add them\add* in the house: and he let the men
go, and they departed.\f + \fr 5.24  \ft tower: or, secret place\f*
\v 25  But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
unto him, Whence \add comest thou\add*, Gehazi? And he said, Thy
servant went no whither.\f + \fr 5.25  \ft no whither: Heb. not hither or
thither\f* 
\v 26  And he said unto him, Went not mine heart \add with thee\add*,
when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? \add Is
it\add* a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards,
and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
\v 27  The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy
seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper \add as
white\add* as snow. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 
\v 2  Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every
man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.
And he answered, Go ye. 
\v 3  And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.
And he answered, I will go. 
\v 4  So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
down wood. 
\v 5  But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:
and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.\f + \fr 6.5 
\ft axe head: Heb. iron\f* 
\v 6  And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
place. And he cut down a stick, and cast \add it\add* in thither; and the
iron did swim. 
\v 7  Therefore said he, Take \add it\add* up to thee. And he put
out his hand, and took it. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
with his servants, saying, In such and such a place \add shall be\add*
my camp.\f + \fr 6.8  \ft camp: or, encamping\f* 
\v 9  And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware
that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come
down. 
\v 10  And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of
God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once
nor twice. 
\v 11  Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled
for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not
shew me which of us \add is\add* for the king of Israel? 
\v 12  And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,
the prophet that \add is\add* in Israel, telleth the king of Israel
the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.\f + \fr 6.12  \ft None: Heb.
No\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And he said, Go and spy where he \add is\add*, that I may
send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, \add he
is\add* in Dothan. 
\v 14  Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.\f + \fr 6.14 
\ft great: Heb. heavy\f* 
\v 15  And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.
And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?\f + \fr 6.15 
\ft the servant: or, the minister\f* 
\v 16  And he answered, Fear not: for they that \add be\add* with us
\add are\add* more than they that \add be\add* with them. 
\v 17  And Elisha prayed, and said, \nd LORD\nd*, I pray thee, open
his eyes, that he may see. And the \nd LORD\nd* opened the eyes of the young
man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain \add was\add* full of
horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 
\v 18  And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he
smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Elisha said unto them, This \add is\add* not the way, neither
\add is\add* this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the
man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.\f + \fr 6.19  \ft follow…: Heb. come ye after

\v 20  And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
Elisha said, \nd LORD\nd*, open the eyes of these \add men\add*,
that they may see. And the \nd LORD\nd* opened their eyes, and they
saw; and, behold, \add they were\add* in the midst of Samaria. 
\v 21  And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
father, shall I smite \add them\add*? shall I smite \add them\add*?
\v 22  And he answered, Thou shalt not smite \add them:\add* wouldest thou
smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy
bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink,
and go to their master. 
\v 23  And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master.
So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria
gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
\v 25  And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
besieged it, until an ass’s head was \add sold\add* for fourscore
\add pieces\add* of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s
dung for five \add pieces\add* of silver. 
\v 26  And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 
\v 27  And he said, If the \nd LORD\nd* do not help thee, whence
shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?\f + \fr 6.27 
\ft If…: or, Let not the \+nd LORD\+nd* save thee\f* 
\v 28  And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered,
This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day,
and we will eat my son to morrow. 
\v 29  So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the
next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her
son.\f + \fr 6.29  \ft next: Heb. other\f* 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the
woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall,
and the people looked, and, behold, \add he had\add* sackcloth within
upon his flesh. 
\v 31  Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 
\v 32  But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
\add the king\add* sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger
came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer
hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh,
shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: \add is\add* not the
sound of his master’s feet behind him? 
\v 33  And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came
down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil \add is\add* of the
\nd LORD\nd*; what should I wait for the \nd LORD\nd* any longer?
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the \nd LORD\nd*; Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd*, To morrow about this time \add shall\add*
a measure of fine flour \add be sold\add* for a shekel, and two measures
of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. 
\v 2  Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man
of God, and said, Behold, \add if\add* the \nd LORD\nd* would make
windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
see \add it\add* with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.\f + \fr 7.2 
\ft a lord…: Heb. a lord which belonged to the king leaning upon his

\p
\v 3 ¶ And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\v 4  If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine \add is\add*
in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the
Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but
die. 
\v 5  And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp
of Syria, behold, \add there was\add* no man there. 
\v 6  For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
of chariots, and a noise of horses, \add even\add* the noise of a
great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel
hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the
Egyptians, to come upon us. 
\v 7  Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it \add was\add*,
and fled for their life. 
\v 8  And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence
silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid \add it;\add* and came
again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence \add also\add*,
and went and hid \add it\add*. 
\v 9  Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day \add is\add*
a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the
morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come,
that we may go and tell the king’s household.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft some…: Heb. we shall find
punishment\f* 
\v 10  So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,
\add there was\add* no man there, neither voice of man, but horses
tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they \add were\add*. 
\v 11  And he called the porters; and they told \add it\add* to the
king’s house within. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants,
I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we
\add be\add* hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide
themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city,
we shall catch them alive, and get into the city. 
\v 13  And one of his servants answered and said, Let \add some\add*
take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they
\add are\add* as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold,
\add I say\add*, they \add are\add* even as all the multitude of the
Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.\f + \fr 7.13 
\ft in the city: Heb. in it\f* 
\v 14  They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 
\v 15  And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way
\add was\add* full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast
away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
\v 16  And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
So a measure of fine flour was \add sold\add* for a shekel, and two
measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the
gate: and the people trode  upon him in the gate, and he died, as the
man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 
\v 18  And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine
flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate
of Samaria: 
\v 19  And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
\add if\add* the \nd LORD\nd* should make windows in heaven, might such a
thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
but shalt not eat thereof. 
\v 20  And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the
gate, and he died. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn
wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath called
for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years. 
\v 2  And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the
Philistines seven years. 
\v 3  And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman
returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to
cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 
\v 4  And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath
done. 
\v 5  And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son
he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her
land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this \add is\add* the woman, and this
\add is\add* her son, whom Elisha restored to life. 
\v 6  And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that \add was\add*

the land, even until now.\f + \fr 8.6  \ft officer: or, eunuch\f*
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria
was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
\v 8  And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* by him,
saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
\v 9  So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good

and the man of God wept.\f + \fr 8.11  \ft stedfastly: Heb. and set

\v 12  And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I
know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong
holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the
sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with
child. 
\v 13  And Hazael said, But what, \add is\add* thy servant a dog,
that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The \nd LORD\nd*
hath shewed me that thou \add shalt be\add* king over Syria. 
\v 14  So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me \add that\add*

\v 15  And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
and dipped \add it\add* in water, and spread \add it\add* on his

\v 16 ¶ And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,

\v 21  So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about,
and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their
tents. 
\v 22  Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
\v 23  And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, \add are\add*

\p
\v 28 ¶ And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\v 29  And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against
Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah

\v 1  And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine

\v 2  And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of

\v 3  Then take the box of oil, and pour \add it\add* on his head,
and say, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I have anointed thee king over

\p
\v 4 ¶ So the young man, \add even\add* the young man the prophet,
went to Ramoth-gilead. 
\v 5  And when he came, behold, the captains of the host \add were\add*
sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu
said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 
\v 6  And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the \nd LORD\nd*,
\add even\add* over Israel. 
\v 7  And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the
servants of the \nd LORD\nd*, at the hand of Jezebel. 
\v 8  For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut
up and left in Israel: 
\v 9  And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
\v 10  And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
\add there shall be\add* none to bury \add her\add*. And he opened

\p
\v 11 ¶ Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and \add one\add*
said unto him, \add Is\add* all well? wherefore came this mad \add fellow\add*
to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
\v 12  And they said, \add It is\add* false; tell us now. And he
said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
I have anointed thee king over Israel. 
\v 13  Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put

saying, Jehu is king.\f + \fr 9.13  \ft is king: Heb. reigneth\f*
\v 14  So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel,
because of Hazael king of Syria. 
\v 15  But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael
king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, \add then\add*

\v 16  So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram
lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
\v 17  And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.
And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him

\v 18  So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
saith the king, \add Is it\add* peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with
peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger
came to them, but he cometh not again. 
\v 19  Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
said, Thus saith the king, \add Is it\add* peace? And Jehu answered,
What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. 
\v 20  And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not

And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each

whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts \add are so\add*
many? 
\v 23  And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
\add There is\add* treachery, O Ahaziah. 
\v 24  And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk
down in his chariot.\f + \fr 9.24  \ft drew…: Heb. filled his hand with a

\v 25  Then said \add Jehu\add* to Bidkar his captain, Take up, \add and\add*
cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father,
the \nd LORD\nd* laid this burden upon him; 
\v 26  Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the

said, Smite him also in the chariot. \add And they did so\add* at the going

and died there. 
\v 28  And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
\v 29  And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
to reign over Judah.

\v 31  And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, \add Had\add*

\v 32  And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who \add is\add*

\v 33  And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and \add some\add*

\v 34  And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
see now this cursed \add woman\add*, and bury her: for she \add is\add*
a king’s daughter. 
\v 35  And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
the skull, and the feet, and the palms of \add her\add* hands. 
\v 36  Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This

\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought
up Ahab’s \add children\add*, saying,\f + \fr 10.1  \ft them…: Heb.

house. 
\v 4  But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings

\v 5 And he that \add was\add* over the house, and he that \add was\add*
over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up \add of the children\add*,
sent to Jehu, saying, We \add are\add* thy servants, and will do
all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou \add that which
is\add* good in thine eyes. 
\v 6  Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
\add be\add* mine, and \add if\add* ye will hearken unto my voice,
take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to
Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, \add being\add*

\v 7  And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they

in baskets, and sent him \add them\add* to Jezreel. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in
two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 
\v 9  And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
and said to all the people, Ye \add be\add* righteous: behold, I
conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
\v 10  Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the

\v 13  Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who

\v 14  And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and

\p
\v 15 ¶ And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab
the son of Rechab \add coming\add* to meet him: and he saluted him, and
said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart \add is\add* with thy

So they made him ride in his chariot. 
\v 17  And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying
of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake to Elijah. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
Ahab served Baal a little; \add but\add* Jehu shall serve him much.
\v 19  Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his

\v 20  And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they

\v 21  And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers

\v 22  And he said unto him that \add was\add* over the vestry, Bring
forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
forth vestments. 
\v 23  And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look
that there be here with you none of the servants of the \nd LORD\nd*,
but the worshippers of Baal only. 
\v 24  And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, \add If\add* any
of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, \add he that letteth him
go\add*, his life \add shall be\add* for the life of him. 
\v 25  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,
Go in, \add and\add* slay them; let none come forth. And they smote
them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast
\add them\add* out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.\f + \fr 10.25

\v 27  And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the

\v 28  Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ Howbeit \add from\add* the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,

\v 30  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done

\v 5  And he commanded them, saying, This \add is\add* the thing

\v 9  And the captains over the hundreds did according to all \add things\add*
that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men

\v 10  And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
David’s spears and shields, that \add were\add* in the temple of the

and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. 
\v 15  But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,

\v 18  And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,

And the priest appointed officers over the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 11.18

And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his
face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the
horsemen thereof. 
\v 15  And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
unto him bow and arrows. 
\v 16  And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the

Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the

for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed
\add them\add*. 
\v 18  And he said, Take the arrows. And he took \add them\add*.
And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he
smote thrice, and stayed. 
\v 19  And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have
smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst
consumed \add it:\add* whereas now thou shalt smite Syria \add but\add*
thrice. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
\v 21  And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they
spied a band \add of men;\add* and they cast the man into the sepulchre
of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of
Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.\f + \fr 13.21  \ft was…: Heb. went

\v 22 ¶ But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
Jehoahaz. 
\v 23  And the \nd LORD\nd* was gracious unto them, and had compassion

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast

\v 25  And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand

\v 1  In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel

\v 2  He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
\add was\add* Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 
\v 3  And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as
Joash his father did. 
\v 4  Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed
in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his
father. 
\v 6  But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is
written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the
children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every
man shall be put to death for his own sin. 
\v 7  He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.\f + \fr 14.7

\v 9  And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
saying, The thistle that \add was\add* in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
\add was\add* in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to
wife: and there passed by a wild beast that \add was\add* in Lebanon,
and trode down the thistle. 
\v 10  Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee
up: glory \add of this\add*, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou

\v 11  But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the

\v 12  And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
every man to their tents.\f + \fr 14.12  \ft put…: Heb. smitten\f*
\v 13  And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem,
and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the
corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
\v 14  And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were
found in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and in the treasures of the
king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 16  And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
\v 18  And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, \add are\add* they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 19  Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
\v 20  And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
with his fathers in the city of David. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which \add was\add*
sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.\f + \fr 14.21 
\ft Azariah: also called, Uzziah\f* 
\v 22  He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
slept with his fathers. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in
Samaria, \add and reigned\add* forty and one years. 
\v 24  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
\v 25  He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the
son of Amittai, the prophet, which \add was\add* of Gath-hepher.
\v 26  For the \nd LORD\nd* saw the affliction of Israel, \add that it
was\add* very bitter: for \add there was\add* not any shut up, nor any
left, nor any helper for Israel. 
\v 27  And the \nd LORD\nd* said not that he would blot out the name
of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam
the son of Joash. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did,
and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
Hamath, \add which belonged\add* to Judah, for Israel, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 29  And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, \add even\add* with the
kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

\p
\v 1  In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.\f + \fr 15.1  \ft Azariah: also called,

\v 2  Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \add was\add*

\v 3  And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
\v 4  Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed
 and burnt incense still on the high places. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* smote the king, so that he was a leper
unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham

land. 
\v 6  And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 7  So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 8 ¶ In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
\v 9  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 
\v 10  And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote

\v 12 This \add was\add* the word of the \nd LORD\nd* which he spake
unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the

\p
\v 13 ¶ Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and

in Samaria.\f + \fr 15.13  \ft Uzziah: Gr. Ozias\f*\f + \fr 15.13

\v 14  For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came

\v 15  And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
made, behold, they \add are\add* written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that \add were\add* therein, and the
coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not \add to him\add*,
therefore he smote \add it; and\add* all the women therein that were with
child he ripped up. 
\v 17  In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, \add and reigned\add*
ten years in Samaria. 
\v 18  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

\v 19  \add And\add* Pul the king of Assyria came against the land:
and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand

\v 20  And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, \add even\add* of all the mighty

\v 21 ¶ And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did,

\v 22  And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.

\v 23 ¶ In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the
son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, \add and reigned\add*
two years. 
\v 24  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

\v 25  But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s
house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites:
and he killed him, and reigned in his room. 
\v 26  And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they
\add are\add* written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, \add and

\v 28  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

\v 29  In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king
of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and
Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali,
and carried them captive to Assyria. 
\v 30  And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah
the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the

\v 31  And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they

\v 35 ¶ Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed

\v 37  In those days the \nd LORD\nd* began to send against Judah

of Israel. 
\v 4  And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the

\p
\v 5 ¶ Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could
not overcome \add him\add*. 
\v 6  At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria,

\v 8  And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house

\v 12  And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the

\v 13  And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings,

side of the altar. 
\v 15  And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the

offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering,
with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the

and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire \add by\add*. 
\v 16  Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
commanded. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen
oxen that \add were\add* under it, and put it upon a pavement of

\v 18  And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the

\p
\v 19 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, \add are\add*

\v 20  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers

\p
\v 1  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the

\v 2  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

\p
\v 6 ¶ In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in
Habor \add by\add* the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\p
\v 7 For \add so\add* it was, that the children of Israel had sinned
against the \nd LORD\nd* their God, which had brought them up out of the
land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had
feared other gods, 
\v 8  And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the \nd LORD\nd*
cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
Israel, which they had made. 
\v 9  And the children of Israel did secretly \add those\add* things that
\add were\add* not right against the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and they
built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the
watchmen to the fenced city. 
\v 10  And they set them up images and groves in every high hill,

wicked things to provoke the \nd LORD\nd* to anger: 
\v 12  For they served idols, whereof the \nd LORD\nd* had said unto them, Ye shall not
do this thing. 
\v 13  Yet the \nd LORD\nd* testified  against Israel, and against
Judah, by all the prophets, \add and by\add* all the seers, saying,
Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments \add and\add*
my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers,
and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.\f + \fr 17.13 
\ft by: Heb. by the hand of\f* 
\v 14  Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,

\v 15  And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they
followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that
\add were\add* round about them, \add concerning\add* whom the \nd LORD\nd*
had charged them, that they should not do like them. 
\v 16  And they left all the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd* their
God, and made them molten images, \add even\add* two calves, and
made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\v 17  And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the
fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to
do evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to provoke him to anger.
\v 18  Therefore the \nd LORD\nd* was very angry with Israel, and
removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe
of Judah only. 
\v 19  Also Judah kept not the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd* their
God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. 
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* rejected  all the seed of Israel, and
afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had
cast them out of his sight. 
\v 21  For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following
the \nd LORD\nd*, and made them sin a great sin. 
\v 22  For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
which he did; they departed not from them; 
\v 23  Until the \nd LORD\nd* removed  Israel out of his sight, as he had
said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
out of their own land to Assyria unto this day. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And the king of Assyria brought \add men\add* from Babylon,
and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
and placed \add them\add* in the cities of Samaria instead of the
children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the
cities thereof. 
\v 25 And \add so\add* it was at the beginning of their dwelling there,
\add that\add* they feared not the \nd LORD\nd*: therefore the \nd LORD\nd*
sent lions among them, which slew \add some\add* of them. 
\v 26  Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know
not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions
among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the
manner of the God of the land. 
\v 27  Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither
one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and
dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the
land. 
\v 28  Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria
came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 29  Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put \add them\add*
in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every
nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 
\v 30  And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of
Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
\v 31  And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods
of Sepharvaim. 
\v 32  So they feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and made unto themselves of the
lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the
houses of the high places. 
\v 33  They feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and served their own gods, after the
manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.\f + \fr 17.33

\v 34  Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear

commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 
\v 35  With whom the \nd LORD\nd* had made a covenant, and charged
them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor
serve them, nor sacrifice to them: 
\v 36  But the \nd LORD\nd*, who brought you up out of the land of
Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear,
and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice. 
\v 37  And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the

neither shall ye fear other gods. 
\v 39  But the \nd LORD\nd* your God ye shall fear; and he shall
deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. 
\v 40  Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
manner. 
\v 41  So these nations feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and served their graven
images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did
their fathers, so do they unto this day.

\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
king of Israel, \add that\add* Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
began to reign.\f + \fr 18.1  \ft Hezekiah: he is called Ezekias\f*
\v 2  Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he

\v 3  And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the

\p
\v 4 ¶ He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut
down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses
had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense
to it: and he called it Nehushtan.\f + \fr 18.4  \ft images: Heb.
statues\f*\f + \fr 18.4  \ft Nehushtan: that is, A piece of brass\f*
\v 5  He trusted in the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel; so that after
him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor \add any\add*
that were before him. 
\v 6  For he clave to the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* departed not from
following him, but kept his commandments, which the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded Moses.\f + \fr 18.6  \ft from…: Heb. from after him\f*
\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* was with him; \add and\add* he prospered
whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of

\v 8  He smote the Philistines, \add even\add* unto Gaza, and the
borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.\f + \fr 18.8

\p
\v 9 ¶ And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
\add was\add* the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
\add that\add* Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria,
and besieged it. 
\v 10  And at the end of three years they took it: \add even\add*
in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that \add is\add* the ninth year of
Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 
\v 11  And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
and put them in Halah and in Habor \add by\add* the river of Gozan,
and in the cities of the Medes: 
\v 12  Because they obeyed not the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* their
God, but transgressed his covenant, \add and\add* all that Moses
the servant of the \nd LORD\nd* commanded, and would not hear \add them\add*,
nor do \add them\add*. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and
took them.\f + \fr 18.13  \ft Sennacherib: Heb. Sanherib\f* 
\v 14  And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou
puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto
Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold. 
\v 15  And Hezekiah gave \add him\add* all the silver that was found
in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and in the treasures of the king’s
house. 
\v 16  At that time did Hezekiah cut off \add the gold from\add*
the doors of the temple of the \nd LORD\nd*, and \add from\add* the

\v 17 ¶ And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh
from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.
And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up,
they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which \add is\add*

\v 18  And when they had called to the king, there came out to them

and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.\f + \fr 18.18 
\ft scribe: or, secretary\f* 
\v 19  And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus

this wherein thou trustest? 
\v 20  Thou sayest, (but \add they are but\add* vain words,) \add I

\v 22  But if ye say unto me, We trust in the \nd LORD\nd* our God:
\add is\add* not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah
hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
before this altar in Jerusalem? 
\v 23  Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be
able on thy part to set riders upon them.\f + \fr 18.23  \ft pledges: or,

\v 24  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots
and for horsemen? 
\v 25  Am I now come up without the \nd LORD\nd* against this place
to destroy it? The \nd LORD\nd* said to me, Go up against this land,
and destroy it. 
\v 26  Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian
language; for we understand \add it:\add* and talk not with us in the Jews’
language in the ears of the people that \add are\add* on the wall.
\v 27  But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy

\ft their own piss: Heb. the water of their feet\f* 
\v 28  Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the
king of Assyria: 
\v 29  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be
able to deliver you out of his hand: 
\v 30  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
The \nd LORD\nd* will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be
delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 31  Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
Make \add an agreement\add* with me by a present, and come out to me, and

\v 32  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,

\v 33  Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered  at all his

\v 34 Where \add are\add* the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where
\add are\add* the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered
Samaria out of mine hand? 
\v 35 Who \add are\add* they among all the gods of the countries,
that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the \nd LORD\nd*
should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? 
\v 36  But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
\v 37  Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which \add was\add*
over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
the recorder, to Hezekiah with \add their\add* clothes rent, and
told him the words of Rab-shakeh. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard \add it\add*,
that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and
went into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 2  And he sent Eliakim, which \add was\add* over the household,
and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
\v 3  And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day \add is\add*

\v 4  It may be the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will hear all the words
of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach

\v 5  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast
heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\v 7  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the
sword in his own land. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\v 9  And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come
out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah,
saying, 
\v 10  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 11  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done
to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
\v 12  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
have destroyed; \add as\add* Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the

\v 13 Where \add is\add* the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad,
and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers,
and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and spread it before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 15  And Hezekiah prayed before the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, O \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, which dwellest \add between\add* the cherubims, thou art the
God, \add even\add* thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth;
thou hast made heaven and earth. 
\v 16  \nd LORD\nd*, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, \nd LORD\nd*,

sent him to reproach the living God. 
\v 17  Of a truth, \nd LORD\nd*, the kings of Assyria have destroyed
the nations and their lands, 
\v 18  And have cast their gods into the fire: for they \add were\add*
no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have
destroyed them.\f + \fr 19.18  \ft cast: Heb. given\f* 
\v 19  Now therefore, O \nd LORD\nd* our God, I beseech thee, save

\p
\v 20 ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, \add That\add* which thou hast

\v 21 This \add is\add* the word that the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken

against the Holy \add One\add* of Israel. 
\v 23  By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast
said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height
of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the

\v 29 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat

\v 35 ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*
went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore

\v 36  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,

\v 37  And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of

\v 7  And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid

\v 9  And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the \nd LORD\nd*,
that the \nd LORD\nd* will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 
\v 10  And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow
to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten

\v 15  And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
answered, All \add the things\add* that \add are\add* in mine house

\v 19  Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good \add is\add* the word

\v 21  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son

\v 1  Manasseh \add was\add* twelve years old when he began to reign,

cast out before the children of Israel. 
\v 3  For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father
had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove,
as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven,
and served them. 
\v 4  And he built altars in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, of which the
\nd LORD\nd* said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. 
\v 5  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards:
he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to provoke
\add him\add* to anger. 
\v 7  And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
house, of which the \nd LORD\nd* said to David, and to Solomon his
son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all
tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
\v 8  Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the
land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do
according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the
law that my servant Moses commanded them. 
\v 9  But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
evil than did the nations whom the \nd LORD\nd* destroyed before
the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake  by his servants the prophets,
saying, 
\v 11  Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
\add and\add* hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which

\v 12  Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, Behold, I
\add am\add* bringing \add such\add* evil upon Jerusalem and Judah,
that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 
\v 13  And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the

\v 15  Because they have done \add that which was\add* evil in my
sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers
came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. 
\v 16  Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made
Judah to sin, in doing \add that which was\add* evil in the sight
of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 21.16  \ft from…: Heb. from mouth to

and his sin that he sinned, \add are\add* they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 18  And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the

\v 21  And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

\v 23 ¶ And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew
the king in his own house. 
\v 24  And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son
king in his stead. 
\v 25  Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\v 26  And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza:

\v 2  And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the

aside to the right hand or to the left. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
\add that\add* the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son
of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
\v 4  Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
which is brought into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, which the keepers

\v 5  And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work,

of the \nd LORD\nd*, to repair the breaches of the house, 
\v 6  Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
and hewn stone to repair the house. 
\v 7  Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe,
I have found the book of the law in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. 
\v 9  And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was
found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that
do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 22.9 
\ft gathered: Heb. melted\f* 
\v 10  And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the

\p
\v 11  And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
\v 12  And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the
son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe,
and Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying,\f + \fr 22.12  \ft Achbor: or,

\v 13  Go ye, enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* for me, and for the people,

for great \add is\add* the wrath of the \nd LORD\nd* that is kindled
against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words
of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.
\v 14  So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum
the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she
dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.\f + \fr 22.14

\v 15 ¶ And she said unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of

\v 16  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, \add even\add* all the words
of the book which the king of Judah hath read: 
\v 17  Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works
of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this
place, and shall not be quenched. 
\v 18  But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
\nd LORD\nd*, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*
God of Israel, \add As touching\add* the words which thou hast heard;
\v 19  Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
before the \nd LORD\nd*, when thou heardest what I spake against this
place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a
desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before
me; I also have heard \add thee\add*, saith the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 20  Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be
gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the
evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king
word again. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
of Judah and of Jerusalem. 
\v 2  And the king went up into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and all the
men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the
priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great:
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
which was found in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 23.2  \ft both…: Heb. from small even unto

\p
\v 3 ¶ And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before

commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all \add their\add*
heart and all \add their\add* soul, to perform the words of this
covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood

\p
\v 4  And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth
out of the temple of the \nd LORD\nd* all the vessels that were made
for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he
burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried
the ashes of them unto Beth-el. 
\v 5  And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah
had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of
Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned
incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets,
and to all the host of heaven.\f + \fr 23.5  \ft put…: Heb. caused to

without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook
Kidron, and stamped \add it\add* small to powder, and cast the powder
thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 
\v 7  And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that \add were\add*
by the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, where the women wove hangings for the
grove.\f + \fr 23.7  \ft hangings: Heb. houses\f* 
\v 8  And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah,
and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,
from Geba to Beer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that
\add were\add* in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor
of the city, which \add were\add* on a man’s left hand at the gate
of the city. 
\v 9  Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
altar of the \nd LORD\nd* in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened
bread among their brethren. 
\v 10  And he defiled Topheth, which \add is\add* in the valley of the
children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter
to pass through the fire to Molech. 
\v 11  And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which \add was\add*
in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.\f + \fr 23.11 
\ft chamberlain: or, eunuch, or, officer\f* 
\v 12  And the altars that \add were\add* on the top of the upper
chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars
which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
did the king beat down, and brake \add them\add* down from thence, and
cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.\f + \fr 23.12  \ft brake…: or, ran from

\v 13  And the high places that \add were\add* before Jerusalem, which

Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination
of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites,
and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the
king defile.\f + \fr 23.13  \ft the mount…: that is, the mount of

\v 14  And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,

\v 15 ¶ Moreover the altar that \add was\add* at Beth-el, \add and\add*

sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down,
and burned the high place, \add and\add* stamped \add it\add* small to

\v 16  And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that
\add were\add* there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the
sepulchres, and burned \add them\add* upon the altar, and polluted
it, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd* which the man of God
proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. 
\v 17  Then he said, What title \add is\add* that that I see? And the
men of the city told him, \add It is\add* the sepulchre of the man
of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast
done against the altar of Beth-el. 
\v 18  And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his

\v 19  And all the houses also of the high places that \add were\add*

\add the \+nd Lord\+nd*\add* to anger, Josiah took away, and did
to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el. 
\v 20  And he slew all the priests of the high places that \add were\add*
there upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned
to Jerusalem.\f + \fr 23.20  \ft slew: or, sacrificed\f* 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
unto the \nd LORD\nd* your God, as \add it is\add* written in the
book of this covenant. 
\v 22  Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days
of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings
of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 
\v 23  But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, \add wherein\add*
this passover was holden to the \nd LORD\nd* in Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ Moreover the \add workers with\add* familiar spirits, and the
wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations
that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written
in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 23.24 
\ft images: or, teraphim\f* 
\p
\v 25  And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned

\add any\add* like him. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ Notwithstanding the \nd LORD\nd* turned not from the fierceness
of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.\f + \fr 23.26 
\ft provocations: Heb. angers\f* 
\v 27  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, I will remove Judah also out of my

which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\v 28  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, \add are\add*

\p
\v 29 ¶ In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the
king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against
him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
\v 30  And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre.
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed

away: and he came to Egypt, and died there. 
\v 35  And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of
Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the
land, of every one according to his taxation, to give \add it\add*

\p
\v 36 ¶ Jehoiakim \add was\add* twenty and five years old when he began to

\v 37  And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the sight of the

\c 24  
\p
\v 1  In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim

\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* sent against him bands of the Chaldees,
and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the

\v 4  And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled

\p
\v 5 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
\add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah? 
\v 6  So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
reigned  in his stead. 
\v 7  And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the
river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

\v 24  And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them,
Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and

\v 25  But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the
