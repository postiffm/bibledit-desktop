\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the names of the children of Israel,
which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
\v 2  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
\v 3  Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
\v 4  Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
\v 5  And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt \add already\add*.\f + \fr 1.5 
\ft loins: Heb. thigh\f* 
\v 6  And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
\p
\v 8  Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
\v 9  And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children
of Israel \add are\add* more and mightier than we: 
\v 10  Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply,
and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join
also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and \add so\add* get them
up out of the land. 
\v 11  Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their
burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
\v 12  But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied
and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.\f + \fr 1.12 
\ft But…: Heb. And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, etc\f*
\v 13  And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
rigour: 
\v 14  And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their
service, wherein they made them serve, \add was\add* with rigour.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
name of the one \add was\add* Shiphrah, and the name of the other
Puah: 
\v 16  And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
women, and see \add them\add* upon the stools; if it \add be\add*
a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it \add be\add* a daughter,
then she shall live. 
\v 17  But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 
\v 18  And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
\v 19  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
\add are\add* not as the Egyptian women; for they \add are\add* lively,
and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 
\v 20  Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
\v 21  And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
made them houses. 
\v 22  And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save
alive. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took \add to
wife\add* a daughter of Levi. 
\v 2  And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
\add was a\add* goodly \add child\add*, she hid him three months.
\v 3  And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put
the child therein; and she laid \add it\add* in the flags by the
river’s brink. 
\v 4  And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash \add herself\add*
at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she
saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
\v 6  And when she had opened \add it\add*, she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This \add is
one\add* of the Hebrews’ children. 
\v 7  Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and
call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the
child for thee? 
\v 8  And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
called the child’s mother. 
\v 9  And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
and nurse it for me, and I will give \add thee\add* thy wages. And the
woman took the child, and nursed it. 
\v 10  And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,
and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,
Because I drew him out of the water.\f + \fr 2.10  \ft Moses: that is, Drawn
out\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown,
that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\v 12  And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
\add there was\add* no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
sand. 
\v 13  And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore
smitest thou thy fellow? 
\v 14  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest
thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared,
and said, Surely this thing is known.\f + \fr 2.14  \ft a prince: Heb. a man, a
prince\f* 
\v 15  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of
Midian: and he sat down by a well. 
\p
\v 16  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
and drew \add water\add*, and filled the troughs to water their father’s
flock.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft priest: or, prince\f* 
\v 17  And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood
up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
\v 18  And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How \add is it
that\add* ye are come so soon to day?\f + \fr 2.18  \ft Reuel: called also Jethro, or,
Jether\f* 
\v 19  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
shepherds, and also drew \add water\add* enough for us, and watered
the flock. 
\v 20  And he said unto his daughters, And where \add is\add* he? why
\add is\add* it \add that\add* ye have left the man? call him, that he may
eat bread. 
\v 21  And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
Zipporah his daughter. 
\v 22  And she bare \add him\add* a son, and he called his name Gershom:
for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.\f + \fr 2.22 
\ft Gershom: that is, A stranger here\f* 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of
Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage,
and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
\v 24  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
\v 25  And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
\add them\add*.\f + \fr 2.25  \ft had…: Heb. knew\f* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and
came to the mountain of God, \add even\add* to Horeb. 
\v 2  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* appeared unto him in a flame
of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
bush burned with fire, and the bush \add was\add* not consumed. 
\v 3  And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,
why the bush is not burnt. 
\v 4  And when the \nd LORD\nd* saw that he turned aside to see,
God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses,
Moses. And he said, Here \add am\add* I. 
\v 5  And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
feet, for the place whereon thou standest \add is\add* holy ground.
\v 6  Moreover he said, I \add am\add* the God of thy father, the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses
hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said, I have surely seen the affliction
of my people which \add are\add* in Egypt, and have heard their cry
by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
\v 8  And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large,
unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites,
and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
and the Jebusites. 
\v 9  Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians
oppress them. 
\v 10  Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring
forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And Moses said unto God, Who \add am\add* I, that I should
go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
out of Egypt? 
\v 12  And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this \add shall
be\add* a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought
forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
\v 13  And Moses said unto God, Behold, \add when\add* I come unto the
children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What \add is\add*
his name? what shall I say unto them? 
\v 14  And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou
say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 
\v 15  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
children of Israel, The \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this
\add is\add* my name for ever, and this \add is\add* my memorial
unto all generations. 
\p
\v 16  Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The
\nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and \add seen\add*
that which is done to you in Egypt: 
\v 17  And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction
of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\v 18  And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come,
thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
say unto him, The \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us
go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may
sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd* our God. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go,
no, not by a mighty hand.\f + \fr 3.19  \ft no…: or, but by strong
hand\f* 
\v 20  And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you
go. 
\v 21  And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:
\v 22  But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment: and ye shall put \add them\add* upon your sons, and upon your
daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.\f + \fr 3.22  \ft the Egyptians: or,
Egypt\f* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe
me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The \nd LORD\nd*
hath not appeared unto thee. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, What \add is\add* that in thine
hand? And he said, A rod. 
\v 3  And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand,
and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a
rod in his hand: 
\v 5  That they may believe that the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
appeared unto thee. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said furthermore unto him, Put now thine
hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he
took it out, behold, his hand \add was\add* leprous as snow. 
\v 7  And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned
again as his \add other\add* flesh. 
\v 8  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
voice of the latter sign. 
\v 9  And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
water of the river, and pour \add it\add* upon the dry \add land:\add*
and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood
upon the dry \add land\add*.\f + \fr 4.9  \ft shall become: Heb. shall be and shall
be\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Moses said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, O my Lord, I \add am\add*
not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
servant: but I \add am\add* slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\f + \fr 4.10 
\ft eloquent: Heb. a man of words\f*\f + \fr 4.10  \ft heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, nor since the third
day\f* 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth?
or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the
\nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 12  Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach
thee what thou shalt say. 
\v 13  And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand \add of him
whom\add* thou wilt send.\f + \fr 4.13  \ft wilt: or, shouldest\f*
\v 14  And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Moses,
and he said, \add Is\add* not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know
that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet
thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 
\v 15  And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth:
and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
you what ye shall do. 
\v 16  And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
\add even\add* he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of
God. 
\v 17  And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
do signs. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law,
and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which
\add are\add* in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro
said to Moses, Go in peace.\f + \fr 4.18  \ft Jethro: Heb. Jether\f*
\v 19  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return
into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. 
\v 20  And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an
ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod
of God in his hand. 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, When thou goest to return
into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have
put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the
people go. 
\v 22  And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
Israel \add is\add* my son, \add even\add* my firstborn: 
\v 23  And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou
refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, \add even\add*
thy firstborn. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the \nd LORD\nd*
met him, and sought to kill him. 
\v 25  Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin
of her son, and cast \add it\add* at his feet, and said, Surely a
bloody husband \add art\add* thou to me.\f + \fr 4.25  \ft sharp…: or,
knife\f*\f + \fr 4.25  \ft cast…: Heb. made it touch\f* 
\v 26  So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband \add thou
art\add*, because of the circumcision. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness
to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and
kissed him. 
\v 28  And Moses told Aaron all the words of the \nd LORD\nd* who had
sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
of the children of Israel: 
\v 30  And Aaron spake all the words which the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken
unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
\v 31  And the people believed: and when they heard that the \nd LORD\nd*
had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilderness. 
\v 2  And Pharaoh said, Who \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, that I should
obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the \nd LORD\nd*, neither will I let
Israel go. 
\p
\v 3  And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us
go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice
unto the \nd LORD\nd* our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence,
or with the sword. 
\v 4  And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
\v 5  And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now \add are\add*
many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 
\v 6  And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
and their officers, saying, 
\v 7  Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
\v 8  And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore,
ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish \add ought\add* thereof: for they
\add be\add* idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go \add and\add*
sacrifice to our God. 
\v 9  Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
therein; and let them not regard vain words.\f + \fr 5.9  \ft Let there…: Heb. Let the work be heavy upon the
men\f* 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,
and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not
give you straw. 
\v 11  Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
work shall be diminished. 
\v 12  So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land
of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 
\v 13  And the taskmasters hasted \add them\add*, saying, Fulfil
your works, \add your\add* daily tasks, as when there was straw.\f + \fr 5.13 
\ft your daily…: Heb. a matter of a day in his day\f* 
\v 14  And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s
taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, \add and\add* demanded,
Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday
and to day, as heretofore? 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
\v 16  There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
Make brick: and, behold, thy servants \add are\add* beaten; but the
fault \add is\add* in thine own people. 
\v 17  But he said, Ye \add are\add* idle, \add ye are\add* idle:
therefore ye say, Let us go \add and\add* do sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18  Go therefore now, \add and\add* work; for there shall no straw
be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
\v 19  And the officers of the children of Israel did see \add that\add* they
\add were\add* in evil \add case\add*, after it was said, Ye shall not
minish \add ought\add* from your bricks of your daily task. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
forth from Pharaoh: 
\v 21  And they said unto them, The \nd LORD\nd* look upon you, and
judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes
of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their
hand to slay us.\f + \fr 5.21  \ft to be…: Heb. to stink\f* 
\v 22  And Moses returned unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou
\add so\add* evil entreated this people? why \add is\add* it \add that\add*
thou hast sent me? 
\v 23  For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.\f + \fr 5.23 
\ft neither…: Heb. delivering thou hast not delivered\f* 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  Then the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a
strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 
\v 2  And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I \add am\add*
the \nd LORD\nd*:\f + \fr 6.2  \ft the \+nd LORD\+nd*: or, \+nd JEHOVAH\+nd*\f*
\v 3  And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
\add the name of\add* God Almighty, but by my name \nd JEHOVAH\nd*
was I not known to them. 
\v 4  And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
strangers. 
\v 5  And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
\v 6  Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I \add am\add* the
\nd LORD\nd*, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem
you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 
\v 7  And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a
God: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your
God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
\v 8  And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give
it you for an heritage: I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 6.8 
\ft swear: Heb. lift up my hand\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.\f + \fr 6.9 
\ft anguish: Heb. shortness, or, straitness\f* 
\p
\v 10  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 11  Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children
of Israel go out of his land. 
\v 12  And Moses spake before the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Behold, the
children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh
hear me, who \add am\add* of uncircumcised lips? 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt,
to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ These \add be\add* the heads of their fathers’ houses: The
sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron,
and Carmi: these \add be\add* the families of Reuben. 
\v 15  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these \add are\add*
the families of Simeon. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And these \add are\add* the names of the sons of Levi according to their
generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the
life of Levi \add were\add* an hundred thirty and seven years. 
\v 17  The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
families. 
\v 18  And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath \add were\add* an hundred
thirty and three years. 
\v 19  And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these \add are\add*
the families of Levi according to their generations. 
\v 20  And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she
bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram \add were\add*
an hundred and thirty and seven years. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
\v 22  And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
\v 23  And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister
of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
and Ithamar. 
\v 24  And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
\add are\add* the families of the Korhites. 
\v 25  And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him \add one\add* of the daughters

the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
\v 26  These \add are\add* that Aaron and Moses, to whom the \nd LORD\nd*
said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their
armies. 
\v 27  These \add are\add* they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these \add are\add*
that Moses and Aaron. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And it came to pass on the day \add when\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 
\v 29  That the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, I \add am\add*
the \nd LORD\nd*: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I
say unto thee. 
\v 30  And Moses said before the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I \add am\add*
of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a
god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
\v 2  Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother
shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his
land. 
\v 3  And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my
wonders in the land of Egypt. 
\v 4  But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, \add and\add* my people
the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
\v 5  And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*,
when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children
of Israel from among them. 
\v 6  And Moses and Aaron did as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded them, so
did they. 
\v 7  And Moses \add was\add* fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore
and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\v 9  When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt
say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast \add it\add* before Pharaoh,
\add and\add* it shall become a serpent. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
\nd LORD\nd* had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh,
and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
\v 11  Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
\v 12  For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:
but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. 
\v 13  And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the
\nd LORD\nd* had said. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart \add is\add*
hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 
\v 15  Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come;
and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine
hand. 
\v 16  And thou shalt say unto him, The \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrews
hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve
me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
\v 17  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, In this thou shalt know that I
\add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: behold, I will smite with the rod that
\add is\add* in mine hand upon the waters which \add are\add* in the
river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
\v 18  And the fish that \add is\add* in the river shall die, and the
river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
water of the river. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take
thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their
streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their
pools of water, that they may become blood; and \add that\add* there may be
blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in \add vessels of\add*
wood, and in \add vessels of\add* stone.\f + \fr 7.19  \ft pools…: Heb. gathering of their
waters\f* 
\v 20  And Moses and Aaron did so, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded;
and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that \add were\add*
in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants;
and all the waters that \add were\add* in the river were turned to
blood. 
\v 21  And the fish that \add was\add* in the river died; and the
river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the
river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 22  And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments:
and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
\nd LORD\nd* had said. 
\v 23  And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he
set his heart to this also. 
\v 24  And all the Egyptians digged  round about the river for water
to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
\v 25  And seven days were fulfilled, after that the \nd LORD\nd*
had smitten the river. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and
say unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Let my people go, that they may
serve me. 
\v 2  And if thou refuse to let \add them\add* go, behold, I will
smite all thy borders with frogs: 
\v 3  And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go
up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy
bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine
ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:\f + \fr 8.3  \ft kneadingtroughs: or,

\v 4  And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,
and upon all thy servants. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch
forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers,
and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
\v 6  And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;
and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
\v 7  And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat
the \nd LORD\nd*, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice
unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat
for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the
frogs from thee and thy houses, \add that\add* they may remain in the
river only?\f + \fr 8.9  \ft Glory…: or, Have this honour over me,

\v 10  And he said, To morrow. And he said, \add Be it\add* according to thy
word: that thou mayest know that \add there is\add* none like unto the
\nd LORD\nd* our God.\f + \fr 8.10  \ft To morrow: or, Against to
morrow\f* 
\v 11  And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses,
and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the
river only. 
\v 12  And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
unto the \nd LORD\nd* because of the frogs which he had brought against
Pharaoh. 
\v 13  And the \nd LORD\nd* did according to the word of Moses; and the
frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
fields. 
\v 14  And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
\v 15  But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the \nd LORD\nd* had said.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch
out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 17  And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man,
and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the
land of Egypt. 
\v 18  And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon
beast. 
\v 19  Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This \add is\add* the
finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened
not unto them; as the \nd LORD\nd* had said. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Rise up early in the
morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;
and say unto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Let my people go,
that they may serve me. 
\v 21  Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
swarms \add of flies\add* upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy

\v 22  And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my

\v 24  And the \nd LORD\nd* did so; and there came a grievous swarm

\p
\v 25 ¶ And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go
ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
\v 26  And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice
the abomination of the Egyptians to the \nd LORD\nd* our God: lo, shall we
sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not
stone us? 
\v 27  We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice
to the \nd LORD\nd* our God, as he shall command us. 
\v 28  And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice
to the \nd LORD\nd* your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not
go very far away: intreat for me. 
\v 29  And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
the \nd LORD\nd* that the swarms \add of flies\add* may depart from
Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to
sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 30  And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 31  And the \nd LORD\nd* did according to the word of Moses; and he
removed the swarms \add of flies\add* from Pharaoh, from his servants,
and from his people; there remained not one. 
\v 32  And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the
people go. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Then the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh,
and tell him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrews, Let my
people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 2  For if thou refuse to let \add them\add* go, and wilt hold them still,
\v 3  Behold, the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* is upon thy cattle which
\add is\add* in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the
camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: \add there shall be\add*
a very grievous murrain. 
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* shall sever between the cattle of Israel
and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all \add that
is\add* the children’s of Israel. 
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* appointed  a set time, saying, To morrow
the \nd LORD\nd* shall do this thing in the land. 
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* did that thing on the morrow, and all the
cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
died not one. 
\v 7  And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle
of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the
people go. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take
to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the
heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
\v 9  And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a
boil breaking forth \add with\add* blains upon man, and upon beast,
throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 10  And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking
forth \add with\add* blains upon man, and upon beast. 
\v 11  And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
\v 12  And the \nd LORD\nd* hardened  the heart of Pharaoh, and he
hearkened not unto them; as the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken unto Moses.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Rise up early in the
morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the
\nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may
serve me. 
\v 14  For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
\add there is\add* none like me in all the earth. 
\v 15  For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
\v 16  And in very deed for this \add cause\add* have I raised thee

\v 17  As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them

\v 18  Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain
a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
\v 19  Send therefore now, \add and\add* gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the
field; \add for upon\add* every man and beast which shall be found
in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come
down upon them, and they shall die. 
\v 20  He that feared the word of the \nd LORD\nd* among the servants
of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
\v 21  And he that regarded not the word of the \nd LORD\nd* left
his servants and his cattle in the field.\f + \fr 9.21  \ft regarded…: Heb. set not his heart

\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine
hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt,
upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the
land of Egypt. 
\v 23  And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the \nd LORD\nd*
sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the
\nd LORD\nd* rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 
\v 24  So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a
nation. 
\v 25  And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
\add was\add* in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote
every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 
\v 26  Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel \add were\add*,
was there no hail. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
unto them, I have sinned this time: the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add*
righteous, and I and my people \add are\add* wicked. 
\v 28  Intreat the \nd LORD\nd* (for \add it is\add* enough) that there be no

know how that the earth \add is\add* the \nd LORD’s\nd*. 
\v 30  But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet

and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 
\v 34  And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his
servants. 
\v 35  And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
children of Israel go; as the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken by Moses.\f + \fr 9.35

to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 4  Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 
\v 5  And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be

\v 7  And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a

\v 8  And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he

\v 10  And he said unto them, Let the \nd LORD\nd* be so with you, as I will let you

\v 11  Not so: go now ye \add that are\add* men, and serve the \nd LORD\nd*;

\p
\v 12 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand
over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, \add even\add* all that the

\v 13  And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,
and the \nd LORD\nd* brought an east wind upon the land all that

\v 15  For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the

thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the

\v 22  And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a

three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the

\v 14  And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall

\v 15  Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day
ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth
leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul
shall be cut off from Israel. 
\v 16  And in the first day \add there shall be\add* an holy convocation,
and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of

\v 20  Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye

\p
\v 21 ¶ Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said
unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families,
and kill the passover.\f + \fr 12.21  \ft lamb: or, kid\f*

\v 23  For the \nd LORD\nd* will pass through to smite the Egyptians;
and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side

the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite \add you\add*.
\v 24  And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy

\v 25  And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the

keep this service. 
\v 26  And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this

\v 27  That ye shall say, It \add is\add* the sacrifice of the \nd LORD’s\nd*

Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
people bowed the head and worshipped. 
\v 28  And the children of Israel went away, and did as the \nd LORD\nd*
had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And it came to pass, that at midnight the \nd LORD\nd* smote
all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh

\v 30  And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for \add there

\p
\v 31 ¶ And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise
up, \add and\add* get you forth from among my people, both ye and the
children of Israel; and go, serve the \nd LORD\nd*, as ye have said.
\v 32  Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
gone; and bless me also. 
\v 33  And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We \add be\add*
all dead \add men\add*. 
\v 34  And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\f + \fr 12.34

\v 35  And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of

\v 36  And the \nd LORD\nd* gave the people favour in the sight of the
Egyptians, so that they lent unto them \add such things as they required\add*.
And they spoiled the Egyptians. 
\p
\v 37 ¶ And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
about six hundred thousand on foot \add that were\add* men, beside

\v 38  And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks,

\v 39  And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust
out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any
victual. 
\p
\v 40 ¶ Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
Egypt, \add was\add* four hundred and thirty years. 
\v 41  And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts
of the \nd LORD\nd* went out from the land of Egypt. 
\v 42 It \add is\add* a night to be much observed unto the \nd LORD\nd*

\p
\v 43 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses and Aaron, This \add is\add*
the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
\v 44  But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 
\v 45  A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
\v 46  In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth
ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break

and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is
born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
\v 49  One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger
that sojourneth among you. 
\v 50  Thus did all the children of Israel; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
\v 51  And it came to pass the selfsame day, \add that\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their

\c 13  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying,

\add is\add* mine. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came
out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand
the \nd LORD\nd* brought you out from this \add place:\add* there shall no leavened

\v 6  Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh

\p
\v 8 ¶ And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, \add This is
done\add* because of that \add which\add* the \nd LORD\nd* did unto me when I came
forth out of Egypt. 
\v 9  And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a

\v 11 ¶ And it shall be when the \nd LORD\nd* shall bring thee into the

and shall give it thee, 
\v 12  That thou shalt set apart unto the \nd LORD\nd* all that openeth

\v 15  And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go,

\v 16  And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets

\v 17 ¶ And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go,
that God led them not \add through\add* the way of the land of the
Philistines, although that \add was\add* near; for God said, Lest peradventure the
people repent  when they see war, and they return to Egypt:

\v 19  And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly

\p
\v 20 ¶ And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* went before them by day in a pillar of a
cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them
light; to go by day and night: 
\v 22  He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar
of fire by night, \add from\add* before the people. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon:
before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 
\v 3  For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They \add are\add*
entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 
\v 4  And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after
them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host;
that the Egyptians may know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
And they did so. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the
heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,
and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go
from serving us? 
\v 6  And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
\v 7  And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
\v 8  And the \nd LORD\nd* hardened  the heart of Pharaoh king of
Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children
of Israel went out with an high hand. 
\v 9  But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses \add and\add*

them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.

\v 10 ¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted
up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were
sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 11  And they said unto Moses, Because \add there were\add* no

wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of
Egypt? 
\v 12  \add Is\add* not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt,
saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For \add it had

\p
\v 13 ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still,

through the midst of the sea. 
\v 17  And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,

\v 18  And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*,

\p
\v 19 ¶ And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their

\v 20  And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness \add to them\add*, but it gave

\v 24  And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the \nd LORD\nd*
looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire

\v 27  And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea

\v 13  And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the
host. 
\v 14  And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
of the wilderness \add there lay\add* a small round thing, \add as\add*
small as the hoar frost on the ground. 
\v 15  And when the children of Israel saw \add it\add*, they said
one to another, It \add is\add* manna: for they wist not what it
\add was\add*. And Moses said unto them, This \add is\add* the bread
which the \nd LORD\nd* hath given you to eat.\f + \fr 16.15  \ft It is…: or, What is this? or, It is a
portion\f* 
\p
\v 16 ¶ This \add is\add* the thing which the \nd LORD\nd* hath commanded,
Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every
man, \add according to\add* the number of your persons; take ye every
man for \add them\add* which \add are\add* in his tents.\f + \fr 16.16 
\ft for every…: Heb. by the poll, or, head\f*\f + \fr 16.16  \ft persons: Heb.
souls\f* 
\v 17  And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
some less. 
\v 18  And when they did mete \add it\add* with an omer, he that gathered
much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they
gathered every man according to his eating. 
\v 19  And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
\v 20  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them
left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses
was wroth with them. 
\v 21  And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And it came to pass, \add that\add* on the sixth day they
gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one \add man:\add* and all the
rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
\v 23  And he said unto them, This \add is that\add* which the \nd LORD\nd*
hath said, To morrow \add is\add* the rest of the holy sabbath unto the
\nd LORD\nd*: bake \add that\add* which ye will bake \add to day\add*,
and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay
up for you to be kept until the morning. 
\v 24  And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not
stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
\v 25  And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day \add is\add* a
sabbath unto the \nd LORD\nd*: to day ye shall not find it in the
field. 
\v 26  Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, \add which
is\add* the sabbath, in it there shall be none. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And it came to pass, \add that\add* there went out \add some\add*
of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
\v 28  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to
keep my commandments and my laws? 
\v 29  See, for that the \nd LORD\nd* hath given you the sabbath,
therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide
ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
seventh day. 
\v 30  So the people rested on the seventh day. 
\v 31  And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
\add was\add* like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it \add was\add*
like wafers \add made\add* with honey. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the \nd LORD\nd*
commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may
see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you
forth from the land of Egypt. 
\v 33  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full
of manna therein, and lay it up before the \nd LORD\nd*, to be kept
for your generations. 
\v 34  As the \nd LORD\nd* commanded  Moses, so Aaron laid it up
before the Testimony, to be kept. 
\v 35  And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the
borders of the land of Canaan. 
\v 36  Now an omer \add is\add* the tenth \add part\add* of an ephah.
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the
commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*, and pitched in Rephidim: and \add there
was\add* no water for the people to drink. 
\v 2  Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye
tempt the \nd LORD\nd*? 
\v 3  And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
against Moses, and said, Wherefore \add is\add* this \add that\add*
thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
and our cattle with thirst? 
\v 4  And Moses cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, What shall I
do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Go on before the people,
and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou
smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. 
\v 6  Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the
people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of
Israel. 
\v 7  And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the
chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the \nd LORD\nd*,
saying, Is the \nd LORD\nd* among us, or not?\f + \fr 17.7  \ft Massah: that is,
Temptation\f*\f + \fr 17.7  \ft Meribah: that is, Chiding, or, Strife\f*
\p
\v 8 ¶ Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
\v 9  And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill
with the rod of God in mine hand.\f + \fr 17.9  \ft Joshua: called
Jesus\f* 
\v 10  So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
\v 11  And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
\v 12  But Moses’ hands \add were\add* heavy; and they took a stone,
and put \add it\add* under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and
Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\v 13  And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge
of the sword. 
\v 14  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Write this \add for\add*
a memorial in a book, and rehearse \add it\add* in the ears of Joshua:
for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
\v 15  And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi:\f + \fr 17.15 
\ft Jehovah-nissi: that is, The \+nd LORD\+nd* my banner\f* 
\v 16  For he said, Because the \nd LORD\nd* hath sworn \add that\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* \add will have\add* war with Amalek from generation
to generation.\f + \fr 17.16  \ft Because…: or, Because the hand of Amalek is against the throne of the

\c 18  
\p
\v 1  When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard
of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, \add and\add*
that the \nd LORD\nd* had brought Israel out of Egypt; 
\v 2  Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife,
after he had sent her back, 
\v 3  And her two sons; of which the name of the one \add was\add*
Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:\f + \fr 18.3 
\ft Gershom: that is A stranger there\f* 
\v 4  And the name of the other \add was\add* Eliezer; for the God
of my father, \add said he, was\add* mine help, and delivered me from the
sword of Pharaoh:\f + \fr 18.4  \ft Eliezer: that is, My God is an
help\f* 
\v 5  And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his
wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount
of God: 
\v 6  And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,
and kissed him; and they asked each other of \add their\add* welfare;
and they came into the tent.\f + \fr 18.7  \ft welfare: Heb. peace\f*
\v 8  And Moses told his father in law all that the \nd LORD\nd*
had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, \add and\add*
all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and \add how\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* delivered them.\f + \fr 18.8  \ft come…: Heb. found
them\f* 
\v 9  And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the \nd LORD\nd*
had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
Egyptians. 
\v 10  And Jethro said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, who hath
delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand
of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the
Egyptians. 
\v 11  Now I know that the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* greater than all
gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly \add he was\add* above them.
\v 12  And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and
sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel,
to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge
the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the
evening. 
\v 14  And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people,
he said, What \add is\add* this thing that thou doest to the people?
why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from
morning unto even? 
\v 15  And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people
come unto me to enquire of God: 
\v 16  When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between
one and another, and I do make \add them\add* know the statutes of
God, and his laws.\f + \fr 18.16  \ft one…: Heb. a man and his fellow\f*
\v 17  And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
doest \add is\add* not good. 
\v 18  Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that
\add is\add* with thee: for this thing \add is\add* too heavy for thee; thou art not
able to perform it thyself alone.\f + \fr 18.18  \ft Thou wilt…: Heb. Fading thou wilt
fade\f* 
\v 19  Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest
bring the causes unto God: 
\v 20  And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must
do. 
\v 21  Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place \add such\add* over them,
\add to be\add* rulers of thousands, \add and\add* rulers of hundreds,
rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
\v 22  And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
\add that\add* every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall
bear \add the burden\add* with thee. 
\v 23  If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee \add so\add*,
then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
go to their place in peace. 
\v 24  So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and
did all that he had said. 
\v 25  And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers
of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
\v 26  And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own
land. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth
out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they \add into\add* the
wilderness of Sinai. 
\v 2  For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come \add to\add*
the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
Israel camped before the mount. 
\v 3  And Moses went up unto God, and the \nd LORD\nd* called unto him out of the
mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and
tell the children of Israel; 
\v 4  Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and \add how\add*
I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. 
\v 5  Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
people: for all the earth \add is\add* mine: 
\v 6  And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These
\add are\add* the words which thou shalt speak unto the children
of Israel. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
laid before their faces all these words which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded him.
\v 8  And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
\nd LORD\nd* hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words
of the people unto the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 9  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a
thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Go unto the people,
and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
\v 11  And be ready against the third day: for the third day the
\nd LORD\nd* will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
Sinai. 
\v 12  And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
Take heed to yourselves, \add that ye\add* go \add not\add* up into the
mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
surely put to death: 
\v 13  There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned,
or shot through; whether \add it be\add* beast or man, it shall not
live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\f + \fr 19.13 
\ft trumpet: or, cornet\f* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified
the people; and they washed their clothes. 
\v 15  And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
come not at \add your\add* wives. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the
voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that
\add was\add* in the camp trembled. 
\v 17  And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
\v 18  And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the \nd LORD\nd*
descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the
smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
\v 19  And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
\v 20  And the \nd LORD\nd* came down upon mount Sinai, on the top
of the mount: and the \nd LORD\nd* called Moses \add up\add* to the
top of the mount; and Moses went up. 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Go down, charge the
people, lest they break through unto the \nd LORD\nd* to gaze, and
many of them perish.\f + \fr 19.21  \ft charge: Heb. contest\f* 
\v 22  And let the priests also, which come near to the \nd LORD\nd*,
sanctify themselves, lest the \nd LORD\nd* break forth upon them.
\v 23  And Moses said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, The people cannot come
up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the
mount, and sanctify it. 
\v 24  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come
up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people
break through to come up unto the \nd LORD\nd*, lest he break forth upon them.
\v 25  So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And God spake all these words, saying, 
\v 2 I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, which have brought
thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\f + \fr 20.2 
\ft bondage: Heb. servants\f* 
\v 3  Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
\v 4  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
\add of any thing\add* that \add is\add* in heaven above, or that
\add is\add* in the earth beneath, or that \add is\add* in the water
under the earth: 
\v 5  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the
\nd LORD\nd* thy God \add am\add* a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth \add generation\add*
of them that hate me; 
\v 6  And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
keep my commandments. 
\v 7  Thou shalt not take the name of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God in
vain; for the \nd LORD\nd* will not hold him guiltless that taketh
his name in vain. 
\v 8  Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
\v 9  Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 
\v 10  But the seventh day \add is\add* the sabbath of the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God: \add in it\add* thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy
son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy
cattle, nor thy stranger that \add is\add* within thy gates: 
\v 11 For \add in\add* six days the \nd LORD\nd* made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them \add is\add*, and rested the
seventh day: wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* blessed  the sabbath day,
and hallowed it. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
upon the land which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God giveth  thee. 
\v 13  Thou shalt not kill. 
\v 14  Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
\v 15  Thou shalt not steal. 
\v 16  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
\v 17  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not
covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant,
nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that \add is\add* thy neighbour’s.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the
people saw \add it\add*, they removed, and stood afar off. 
\v 19  And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
hear: but let not God speak  with us, lest we die. 
\v 20  And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come
to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
sin not. 
\v 21  And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick
darkness where God \add was\add*. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say
unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from

\v 23  Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
make unto you gods of gold. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep,
and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come

\p
\v 7 ¶ And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go
out as the menservants do. 
\v 8  If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be

\v 13  And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver \add him\add*

\v 14  But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay

\p
\v 15 ¶ And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely

\v 27  And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s
tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the
owner of the ox \add shall be\add* quit. 
\v 29  But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath

\v 30  If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give
for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 
\v 31  Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this

\v 32  If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall

\p
\v 33 ¶ And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 
\v 34  The owner of the pit shall make \add it\add* good, \add and\add*

\v 29  And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 
\v 30  And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that
\add they\add* may minister unto me in the priest’s office. 
\v 31  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.
\v 32  Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye
make \add any other\add* like it, after the composition of it: it
\add is\add* holy, \add and\add* it shall be holy unto you. 
\v 33  Whosoever compoundeth \add any\add* like it, or whosoever
putteth \add any\add* of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his
people. 
\p
\v 34 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet
spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; \add these\add* sweet spices
with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like \add weight:\add*
\v 35  And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art

\v 36  And thou shalt beat \add some\add* of it very small, and put

\v 37 And \add as for\add* the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee
holy for the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 38  Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut
off from his people. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2  See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
\v 3  And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
\v 4  To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
brass, 
\v 5  And in cutting of stones, to set \add them\add*, and in carving
of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
\v 6  And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach,
of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted
I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;

\v 11  And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy \add place:\add*
according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 13  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily
my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it \add is\add* a sign between me and you throughout your
generations; that \add ye\add* may know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
that doth sanctify you. 
\v 14  Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it \add is\add* holy
unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death:
for whosoever doeth \add any\add* work therein, that soul shall be cut
off from among his people. 
\v 15  Six days may work be done; but in the seventh \add is\add*
the sabbath of rest, holy to the \nd LORD\nd*: whosoever doeth \add any\add*
work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.\f + \fr 31.15 
\ft holy: Heb. holiness\f* 
\v 16  Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
observe the sabbath throughout their generations, \add for\add* a

\v 17 It \add is\add* a sign between me and the children of Israel
for ever: for \add in\add* six days the \nd LORD\nd* made heaven
and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,
written with the finger of God. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1  And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the
mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said
unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for \add as
for\add* this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
\v 2  And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
\add are\add* in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
daughters, and bring \add them\add* unto me. 
\v 3  And all the people brake off the golden earrings which \add were\add*
in their ears, and brought \add them\add* unto Aaron. 
\v 4  And he received \add them\add* at their hand, and fashioned
it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
said, These \add be\add* thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the
land of Egypt. 
\v 5  And when Aaron saw \add it\add*, he built an altar before it; and
Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow \add is\add* a feast
to the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings,
and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to
drink, and rose up to play. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted
\add themselves:\add* 
\v 8  They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded
them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and said, These \add be\add* thy gods, O Israel,
which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it
\add is\add* a stiffnecked people: 
\v 10  Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may
consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
\v 11  And Moses besought the \nd LORD\nd* his God, and said, \nd LORD\nd*,
why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty
hand?\f + \fr 32.11  \ft the \+nd LORD\+nd*: Heb. the face of the
\+nd LORD\+nd*\f* 
\v 12  Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume
them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and
repent of this evil against thy people. 
\v 13  Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply
your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken
of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit \add it\add*
for ever. 
\v 14  And the \nd LORD\nd* repented  of the evil which he thought
to do unto his people. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
tables of the testimony \add were\add* in his hand: the tables \add were\add*
written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other \add were\add*
they written. 
\v 16  And the tables \add were\add* the work of God, and the writing
\add was\add* the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
\v 17  And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
he said unto Moses, \add There is\add* a noise of war in the camp.
\v 18  And he said, \add It is\add* not the voice of \add them that\add*
shout for mastery, neither \add is it\add* the voice of \add them
that\add* cry for being overcome: \add but\add* the noise of \add them
that\add* sing do I hear.\f + \fr 32.18  \ft being…: Heb. weakness\f*
\p
\v 19 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot,
and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the
mount. 
\v 20  And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt \add it\add*
in the fire, and ground \add it\add* to powder, and strawed \add it\add*
upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink \add of it\add*.
\p
\v 21  And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast
brought so great a sin upon them? 
\v 22  And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
knowest the people, that they \add are set\add* on mischief. 
\v 23  For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for
\add as for\add* this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
\v 24  And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
\add it\add* off. So they gave \add it\add* me: then I cast it into the
fire, and there came out this calf. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And when Moses saw that the people \add were\add* naked;
(for Aaron had made them naked unto \add their\add* shame among their
enemies:)\f + \fr 32.25  \ft their enemies: Heb. those that rose up against
them\f* 
\v 26  Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who \add is\add*
on the \nd LORD’s\nd* side? \add let him come\add* unto me. And all the
sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 
\v 27  And he said unto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of
Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, \add and\add* go in and
out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his
brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.
\v 28  And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
\v 29  For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the \nd LORD\nd*,
even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow
upon you a blessing this day.\f + \fr 32.29  \ft For Moses…: or, And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the
\+nd LORD\+nd*, because every man hath been against his brother,
etc\f*\f + \fr 32.29  \ft Consecrate…: Heb. Fill your hands\f* 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the
\nd LORD\nd*; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
\v 31  And Moses returned unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Oh, this
people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
\v 32  Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot
me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
\v 33  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned
against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
\v 34  Therefore now go, lead the people unto \add the place\add*
of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
\v 35  And the \nd LORD\nd* plagued  the people, because they made
the calf, which Aaron made. 
\c 33  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Depart, \add and\add*
go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the
land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac,
and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 
\v 2  And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out
the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the
Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
\v 3  Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go
up in the midst of thee; for thou \add art\add* a stiffnecked people:
lest I consume thee in the way. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
\v 5  For the \nd LORD\nd* had said unto Moses, Say unto the children
of Israel, Ye \add are\add* a stiffnecked people: I will come up
into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
\v 6  And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
by the mount Horeb. 
\p
\v 7  And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,
afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass,
\add that\add* every one which sought the \nd LORD\nd* went out unto the
tabernacle of the congregation, which \add was\add* without the camp.
\v 8  And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
\add that\add* all the people rose up, and stood every man \add at\add*
his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
tabernacle. 
\v 9  And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle,
the cloudy pillar descended, and stood \add at\add* the door of the
tabernacle, and \add the \+nd LORD\+nd*\add* talked with Moses. 
\v 10  And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand \add at\add*
the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every
man \add in\add* his tent door. 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* spake unto Moses face to face, as a man
speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the
tabernacle. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Moses said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send
with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also
found grace in my sight. 
\v 13  Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,
shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace
in thy sight: and consider that this nation \add is\add* thy people.
\v 14  And he said, My presence shall go \add with thee\add*, and I will give thee
rest. 
\v 15  And he said unto him, If thy presence go not \add with me\add*,
carry us not up hence. 
\v 16  For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
found grace in thy sight? \add is it\add* not in that thou goest
with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
people that \add are\add* upon the face of the earth. 
\v 17  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, I will do this thing
also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight,
and I know thee by name. 
\v 18  And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 
\v 19  And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will
proclaim the name of the \nd LORD\nd* before thee; and will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew
mercy. 
\v 20  And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
man see me, and live. 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Behold, \add there is\add* a place
by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
\v 22  And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will
put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand
while I pass by: 
\v 23  And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
parts: but my face shall not be seen. 
\c 34  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of
stone like unto the first: and I will write upon \add these\add*
tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.
\v 2  And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.
\v 3  And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed
before that mount. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai,
as the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded him, and took in his hand the two
tables of stone. 
\p
\v 5  And the \nd LORD\nd* descended  in the cloud, and stood with him there, and
proclaimed the name of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 6  And the \nd LORD\nd* passed by before him, and proclaimed,
The \nd LORD\nd*, The \nd LORD\nd* God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering,
and abundant in goodness and truth, 
\v 7  Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression
and sin, and that will by no means clear \add the guilty;\add* visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s
children, unto the third and to the fourth \add generation\add*.
\v 8  And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth,
and worshipped. 
\v 9  And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord,
let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it \add is\add* a stiffnecked
people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine
inheritance. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any
nation: and all the people among which thou \add art\add* shall see
the work of the \nd LORD\nd*: for it \add is\add* a terrible thing
that I will do with thee. 
\v 11  Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive
out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite,
and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
\v 12  Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants
of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
\v 13  But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
down their groves:\f + \fr 34.13  \ft images: Heb. statues\f* 
\v 14  For thou shalt worship no other god: for the \nd LORD\nd*,
whose name \add is\add* Jealous, \add is\add* a jealous God: 
\v 15  Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their
gods, and \add one\add* call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
\v 16  And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring
after their gods. 
\v 17  Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days
thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

up to appear before the \nd LORD\nd* thy God thrice in the year.
\v 25  Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left

\v 26  The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring
unto the house of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God. Thou shalt not seethe

\v 27  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Moses, Write thou these words:
for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with
Israel. 
\p
\v 28  And he was there with the \nd LORD\nd* forty days and forty

\v 29 ¶ And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down
from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone
while he talked with him. 
\v 30  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the
skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
\v 31  And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 
\v 32  And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in
commandment all that the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken with him in mount
Sinai. 
\v 33 And \add till\add* Moses had done speaking with them, he put
a vail on his face. 
\v 34  But when Moses went in before the \nd LORD\nd* to speak with him, he
took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake
unto the children of Israel \add that\add* which he was commanded.
\v 35  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the

until he went in to speak with him.

\v 30 ¶ And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the \nd LORD\nd*
hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
tribe of Judah; 
\v 31  And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom,
in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
\v 32  And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
and in brass, 
\v 33  And in the cutting of stones, to set \add them\add*, and in
carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work. 
\v 34  And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, \add both\add*
he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
\v 35  Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of
work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer,
in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the
weaver, \add even\add* of them that do any work, and of those that
devise cunning work. 
\c 36  
\p
\v 1  Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
in whom the \nd LORD\nd* put wisdom and understanding to know how to
work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the
\nd LORD\nd* had commanded. 
\v 2  And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
man, in whose heart the \nd LORD\nd* had put wisdom, \add even\add*
every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
\v 3  And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children
of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary,
to make it \add withal\add*. And they brought yet unto him free offerings
every morning. 
\v 4  And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,
came every man from his work which they made; 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
than enough for the service of the work, which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
to make. 
\v 6  And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more
work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained
from bringing. 
\v 7  For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
it, and too much. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work
of the tabernacle made ten curtains \add of\add* fine twined linen,
and blue, and purple, and scarlet: \add with\add* cherubims of cunning
work made he them. 
\v 9  The length of one curtain \add was\add* twenty and eight cubits,
and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains \add were\add*
all of one size. 
\v 10  And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and \add the
other\add* five curtains he coupled one unto another. 
\v 11  And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of
\add another\add* curtain, in the coupling of the second.\f + \fr 36.11 
\ft selvedge: an edge of cloth so woven that it cannot unravel\f*
\v 12  Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the
edge of the curtain which \add was\add* in the coupling of the second:
the loops held one \add curtain\add* to another. 
\v 13  And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains
one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he made curtains \add of\add* goats’ \add hair\add* for the
tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
\v 15  The length of one curtain \add was\add* thirty cubits, and
four cubits \add was\add* the breadth of one curtain: the eleven
curtains \add were\add* of one size. 
\v 16  And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
\v 17  And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain
which coupleth the second. 
\v 18  And he made fifty taches \add of\add* brass to couple the
tent together, that it might be one.

south side southward: 
\v 24  And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
another board for his two tenons. 
\v 25  And for the other side of the tabernacle, \add which is\add*
toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 
\v 26  And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board,
and two sockets under another board. 
\v 27  And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
\v 28  And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two
sides. 
\v 29  And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the
corners.\f + \fr 36.29  \ft coupled: Heb. twinned\f* 
\v 30  And there were eight boards; and their sockets \add were\add*
sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.\f + \fr 36.30

and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.
\v 33  And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one
end to the other. 
\v 34  And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings
\add of\add* gold \add to be\add* places for the bars, and overlaid
the bars with gold. 
\p
\v 35 ¶ And he made a vail \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet,

work. 
\v 36  And he made thereunto four pillars \add of\add* shittim \add wood\add*,
and overlaid them with gold: their hooks \add were of\add* gold;

\c 37  
\p
\v 1  And Bezaleel made the ark \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits
and a half \add was\add* the length of it, and a cubit and a half
the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: 
\v 2  And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made

\v 10 ¶ And he made the table \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits

\v 15  And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their
anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their
generations. 
\p
\v 16  Thus did Moses: according to all that the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
him, so did he. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And it came to pass in the first month in the second year,
on the first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the tabernacle
was reared up. 
\v 18  And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars. 
\v 19  And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put
the covering of the tent above upon it; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
Moses. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
\v 21  And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the
\nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 
\v 23  And he set the bread in order upon it before the \nd LORD\nd*;
as the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded Moses. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
\v 25  And he lighted the lamps before the \nd LORD\nd*; as the \nd LORD\nd*
commanded Moses. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
before the vail: 
\v 27  And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded
 Moses. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And he set up the hanging \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle.
\v 29  And he put the altar of burnt offering \add by\add* the door
of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt
offering and the meat offering; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation
and the altar, and put water there, to wash \add withal\add*. 
\v 31  And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
feet thereat: 
\v 32  When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came
near unto the altar, they washed; as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 33  And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished
the work. 
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
glory of the \nd LORD\nd* filled the tabernacle. 
\v 35  And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,
because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd*
filled the tabernacle. 
\v 36  And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,
the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:\f + \fr 40.36 
\ft went onward: Heb. journeyed\f* 
\v 37  But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the
day that it was taken up. 
\v 38  For the cloud of the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* upon the tabernacle
by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house
of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
