\v 1  Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children
of Israel asked the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Who shall go up for us against the
Canaanites first, to fight against them? 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have
delivered the land into his hand. 
\v 3  And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my
lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will
go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 
\v 4  And Judah went up; and the \nd LORD\nd* delivered the Canaanites
and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
ten thousand men. 
\v 5  And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they
slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
\v 6  But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 
\v 7  And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered \add their meat\add*
under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft their thumbs…: Heb. the thumbs of their hands and of their
feet\f*\f + \fr 1.7  \ft gathered: or, gleaned\f* 
\v 8  Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had
taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the
city on fire. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the
valley.\f + \fr 1.9  \ft valley: or, low country\f* 
\v 10  And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
(now the name of Hebron before \add was\add* Kirjath-arba:) and they
slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 
\v 11  And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir:
and the name of Debir before \add was\add* Kirjath-sepher: 
\v 12  And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh
it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
\v 13  And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took
it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
\v 14  And it came to pass, when she came \add to him\add*, that she
moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off
\add her\add* ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? 
\v 15  And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the
upper springs and the nether springs. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went
up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the
wilderness of Judah, which \add lieth\add* in the south of Arad;
and they went and dwelt among the people. 
\v 17  And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the
name of the city was called Hormah. 
\v 18  Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 
\v 19  And the \nd LORD\nd* was with Judah; and he drave out \add the inhabitants
of\add* the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the
valley, because they had chariots of iron.\f + \fr 1.19  \ft drave…: or, possessed the
mountain\f* 
\v 20  And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
thence the three sons of Anak. 
\p
\v 21  And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children
of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el:
and the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* with them. 
\v 23  And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth-el. (Now the name
of the city before \add was\add* Luz.) 
\v 24  And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city,
and we will shew thee mercy. 
\v 25  And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his
family. 
\v 26  And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built
a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which \add is\add* the name
thereof unto this day. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ Neither did Manasseh drive out \add the inhabitants of\add*
Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns,
nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites
would dwell in that land. 
\v 28  And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put
the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. 
\p
\v 30 ¶ Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron,
nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became
tributaries. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah,
nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 
\v 32  But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
of the land: for they did not drive them out. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh,
nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites,
the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh
and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them. 
\v 34  And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 
\v 35  But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became
tributaries.\f + \fr 1.35  \ft prevailed: Heb. was heavy\f* 
\v 36  And the coast of the Amorites \add was\add* from the going
up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.\f + \fr 1.36  \ft the going…: or,
Maaleh-acrabbim\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And an angel of the \nd LORD\nd* came up from Gilgal to Bochim,
and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the
land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break
my covenant with you.\f + \fr 2.1  \ft angel: or, messenger\f* 
\v 2  And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice:
why have ye done this? 
\v 3  Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be
\add as thorns\add* in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
\v 4  And it came to pass, when the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* spake
these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
up their voice, and wept. 
\v 5  And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed
there unto the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 2.5  \ft Bochim: that is, Weepers\f*
\p
\v 6 ¶ And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 
\v 7  And the people served the \nd LORD\nd* all the days of Joshua,
and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen
all the great works of the \nd LORD\nd*, that he did for Israel.\f + \fr 2.7 
\ft outlived: Heb. prolonged days after\f* 
\v 8  And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the \nd LORD\nd*,
died, \add being\add* an hundred and ten years old. 
\v 9  And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres,
in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.\f + \fr 2.9 
\ft Timnath-heres: also called, Timnath-serah\f* 
\v 10  And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the
\nd LORD\nd*, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and served Baalim: 
\v 12  And they forsook the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, which brought them
out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the
people that \add were\add* round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the
\nd LORD\nd* to anger. 
\v 13  And they forsook the \nd LORD\nd*, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hot against Israel,
and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he
sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they
could not any longer stand before their enemies. 
\v 15  Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*
was against them for evil, as the \nd LORD\nd* had said, and as the
\nd LORD\nd* had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Nevertheless the \nd LORD\nd* raised up judges, which delivered
them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.\f + \fr 2.16  \ft delivered: Heb.
saved\f* 
\v 17  And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned
quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the
commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*; \add but\add* they did not so.
\v 18  And when the \nd LORD\nd* raised them up judges, then the
\nd LORD\nd* was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand
of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the \nd LORD\nd*
because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and
vexed them. 
\v 19  And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, \add that\add*
they returned, and corrupted \add themselves\add* more than their
fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they
ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.\f + \fr 2.19 
\ft corrupted…: or, were corrupt\f*\f + \fr 2.19  \ft ceased…: Heb. let nothing fall of
their\f* 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hot against Israel;
and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant
which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
\v 21  I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the
nations which Joshua left when he died: 
\v 22  That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
the way of the \nd LORD\nd* to walk therein, as their fathers did
keep \add it\add*, or not. 
\v 23  Therefore the \nd LORD\nd* left those nations, without driving them
out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.\f + \fr 2.23 
\ft left: or, suffered\f* 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the nations which the \nd LORD\nd* left,
to prove Israel by them, \add even\add* as many \add of Israel\add*
as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 
\v 2  Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,
to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
\v 3  \add Namely\add*, five lords of the Philistines, and all the
Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
\v 4  And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
hearken unto the commandments of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he commanded
their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,
and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 
\v 6  And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
\v 7  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and forgat the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and served Baalim and the
groves. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ Therefore the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hot against Israel,
and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia:
and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.\f + \fr 3.8 
\ft Mesopotamia: Heb. Aram-naharaim\f* 
\v 9  And when the children of Israel cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
the \nd LORD\nd* raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel,
who delivered them, \add even\add* Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s
younger brother.\f + \fr 3.9  \ft deliverer: Heb. saviour\f* 
\v 10  And the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came upon him, and he judged
Israel, and went out to war: and the \nd LORD\nd* delivered Chushan-rishathaim
king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed  against
Chushan-rishathaim.\f + \fr 3.10  \ft came: Heb. was\f*\f + \fr 3.10 
\ft Mesopotamia: Heb. Aram\f* 
\v 11  And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
Kenaz died. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*: and the \nd LORD\nd* strengthened Eglon the king of
Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 13  And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek,
and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
\v 14  So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
years. 
\v 15  But when the children of Israel cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*,
the \nd LORD\nd* raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera,
a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel
sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.\f + \fr 3.15  \ft a Benjamite: or, the son of
Jemini\f*\f + \fr 3.15  \ft lefthanded: Heb. shut of his right hand\f*
\v 16  But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
\v 17  And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
\add was\add* a very fat man. 
\v 18  And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent
away the people that bare the present. 
\v 19  But he himself turned again from the quarries that \add were\add*
by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who
said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.\f + \fr 3.19 
\ft quarries: or, graven images\f* 
\v 20  And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from
God unto thee. And he arose out of \add his\add* seat.\f + \fr 3.20 
\ft a summer…: Heb. a parlour of cooling\f* 
\v 21  And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
\v 22  And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly;
and the dirt came out.\f + \fr 3.22  \ft the dirt…: or, it came out at the
buttocks\f* 
\v 23  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors
of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 
\v 24  When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
that, behold, the doors of the parlour \add were\add* locked, they
said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.\f + \fr 3.24 
\ft covereth…: or, doeth his easement\f* 
\v 25  And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened
not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened
\add them:\add* and, behold, their lord \add was\add* fallen down
dead on the earth. 
\v 26  And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 
\v 27  And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down
with him from the mount, and he before them. 
\v 28  And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the \nd LORD\nd*
hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went
down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered
not a man to pass over. 
\v 29  And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men,
all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.\f + \fr 3.29 
\ft lusty: Heb. fat\f* 
\v 30  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
land had rest fourscore years. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered
Israel. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, when Ehud was dead. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* sold them into the hand of Jabin king
of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host \add was\add*
Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 
\v 3  And the children of Israel cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*: for he had
nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed
the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
Israel at that time. 
\v 5  And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah
and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up
to her for judgment. 
\v 6  And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali,
and said unto him, Hath not the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel commanded,
\add saying\add*, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children
of Zebulun? 
\v 7  And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain
of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will
deliver him into thine hand. 
\v 8  And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
go: but if thou wilt not go with me, \add then\add* I will not go.
\v 9  And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the \nd LORD\nd*
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and
went with Barak to Kedesh. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
\v 11  Now Heber the Kenite, \add which was\add* of the children
of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the
Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which \add is\add*
by Kedesh. 
\v 12  And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
up to mount Tabor. 
\v 13  And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, \add even\add*
nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that \add were\add*
with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.\f + \fr 4.13 
\ft together: Heb. by cry, or, proclamation\f* 
\v 14  And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this \add is\add* the
day in which the \nd LORD\nd* hath delivered Sisera into thine hand:
is not the \nd LORD\nd* gone out before thee? So Barak went down
from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. 
\v 15  And the \nd LORD\nd* discomfited  Sisera, and all \add his\add*
chariots, and all \add his\add* host, with the edge of the sword
before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off \add his\add* chariot,
and fled away on his feet. 
\v 16  But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host,
unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the
edge of the sword; \add and\add* there was not a man left.\f + \fr 4.16 
\ft a man: Heb. unto one\f* 
\p
\v 17  Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
wife of Heber the Kenite: for \add there was\add* peace between Jabin
the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn
in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the
tent, she covered him with a mantle.\f + \fr 4.18  \ft mantle: or, rug, or,
blanket\f* 
\v 19  And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water
to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him
drink, and covered him. 
\v 20  Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any
man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here?
that thou shalt say, No. 
\v 21  Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail
into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast
asleep and weary. So he died.\f + \fr 4.21  \ft and took: Heb. and
put\f* 
\v 22  And, behold, as Barak pursued  Sisera, Jael came out to meet
him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest. And when he came into her \add tent\add*, behold, Sisera
lay dead, and the nail \add was\add* in his temples. 
\v 23  So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before
the children of Israel. 
\v 24  And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin
king of Canaan.\f + \fr 4.24  \ft prospered…: Heb. going went and was
hard\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
saying, 
\v 2  Praise ye the \nd LORD\nd* for the avenging of Israel, when the
people willingly offered themselves. 
\v 3  Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, \add even\add*
I, will sing unto the \nd LORD\nd*; I will sing \add praise\add*
to the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel. 
\v 4  \nd LORD\nd*, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst
out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,
the clouds also dropped water. 
\v 5  The mountains melted from before the \nd LORD\nd*, \add even\add*
that Sinai from before the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel.\f + \fr 5.5 
\ft melted: Heb. flowed\f* 
\p
\v 6  In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.\f + \fr 5.6 
\ft travellers: Heb. walkers of paths\f*\f + \fr 5.6  \ft byways: Heb. crooked
ways\f* 
\v 7  \add The inhabitants of\add* the villages ceased, they ceased
in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
\v 8  They chose new gods; then \add was\add* war in the gates: was there a
shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? 
\v 9  My heart \add is\add* toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves
willingly among the people. Bless ye the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 10  Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
and walk by the way.\f + \fr 5.10  \ft Speak: or, Meditate\f* 
\v 11  \add They that are delivered\add* from the noise of archers
in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous
acts of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add even\add* the righteous acts \add toward the
inhabitants\add* of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
of the \nd LORD\nd* go down to the gates.\f + \fr 5.11  \ft righteous…: Heb.
righteousnesses\f* 
\p
\v 12  Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. 
\v 13  Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
among the people: the \nd LORD\nd* made me have dominion over the
mighty. 
\v 14  Out of Ephraim \add was there\add* a root of them against
Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came
down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
writer.\f + \fr 5.14  \ft handle: Heb. draw with\f* 
\v 15  And the princes of Issachar \add were\add* with Deborah; even
Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
divisions of Reuben \add there were\add* great thoughts of heart.\f + \fr 5.15 
\ft foot: Heb. his feet\f*\f + \fr 5.15  \ft thoughts: Heb. impressions\f*\f + \fr 5.15 
\ft For: or, In\f* 
\v 16  Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben \add there were\add* great
searchings of heart.\f + \fr 5.16  \ft For: or, In\f* 
\v 17  Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.\f + \fr 5.17 
\ft shore: or, port\f*\f + \fr 5.17  \ft breaches: or, creeks\f*
\v 18  Zebulun and Naphtali \add were\add* a people \add that\add*
jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.\f + \fr 5.18 
\ft jeoparded: Heb. exposed to reproach\f* 
\v 19  The kings came \add and\add* fought, then fought the kings
of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain
of money. 
\v 20  They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
against Sisera.\f + \fr 5.20  \ft courses: Heb. paths\f* 
\v 21  The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the

\v 1  And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*:
and the \nd LORD\nd* delivered them into the hand of Midian seven

\v 6  And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
and the children of Israel cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 13  And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the \nd LORD\nd*

\v 14  And the \nd LORD\nd* looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy

\v 22  And when Gideon perceived that he \add was\add* an angel of the

\v 23  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Peace \add be\add* unto thee;

\add it\add* by day, that he did \add it\add* by night. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that
\add was\add* by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the

\v 29  And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they
enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done
this thing. 
\v 30  Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut
down the grove that \add was\add* by it. 
\v 31  And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to

\v 37  Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; \add and\add*
if the dew be on the fleece only, and \add it be\add* dry upon all the

\v 38  And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl
full of water. 
\v 39  And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will
speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the
fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the
ground let there be dew. 
\v 40  And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
only, and there was dew on all the ground. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Then Jerubbaal, who \add is\add* Gideon, and all the people that
\add were\add* with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of
Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side
of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 
\v 2  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Gideon, The people that \add are\add* with thee
\add are\add* too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath
saved me. 
\v 3  Now therefore go to, proclaim  in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever
\add is\add* fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early
from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two
thousand; and there remained ten thousand. 
\v 4  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Gideon, The people \add are\add* yet
\add too\add* many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be,
\add that\add* of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall
go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go
with thee, the same shall not go. 
\v 5  So he brought down the people unto the water: and the \nd LORD\nd*
said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue,
as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth
down upon his knees to drink. 
\v 6  And the number of them that lapped, \add putting\add* their
hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 
\v 7  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Gideon, By the three hundred
men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
hand: and let all the \add other\add* people go every man unto his
place. 
\v 8  So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
and he sent all \add the rest of\add* Israel every man unto his tent,
and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the

\p
\v 9 ¶ And it came to pass the same night, that the \nd LORD\nd*
said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
it into thine hand. 
\v 10  But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
down to the host:

\v 13  And when Gideon was come, behold, \add there was\add* a man

\v 14  And his fellow answered and said, This \add is\add* nothing else save the

\p
\v 15 ¶ And it was \add so\add*, when Gideon heard the telling of the

saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the

\v 25  And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the

may hearken unto you. 
\v 8  The trees went forth \add on a time\add* to anoint a king over them; and they
said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. 
\v 9  But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the

\v 10  And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, \add and\add*

\v 11  But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,
and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
\v 12  Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, \add and\add*
reign over us. 
\v 13  And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 
\v 14  Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, \add and\add*
reign over us.\f + \fr 9.14  \ft bramble: or, thistle\f* 
\v 15  And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint

in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour
the cedars of Lebanon. 
\v 16  Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made
Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his
house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
\v 17 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:\f + \fr 9.17  \ft adventured…: Heb. cast his

\v 18  And ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have
slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made
Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he
\add is\add* your brother;) 
\v 19  If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his
house this day, \add then\add* rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also
rejoice in you: 
\v 20  But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the
men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\v 21  And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 
\v 23  Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men
of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\v 24  That the cruelty \add done\add* to the threescore and ten
sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which
aided him in the killing of his brethren.\f + \fr 9.24  \ft aided…: Heb. strengthened his hands to

\v 25  And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top
of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was
told Abimelech. 
\v 26  And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went
over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
\v 27  And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,
and trode \add the grapes\add*, and made merry, and went into the
house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.\f + \fr 9.27 
\ft merry: or, songs\f* 
\v 28  And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who \add is\add* Abimelech, and who
\add is\add* Shechem, that we should serve him? \add is\add* not
\add he\add* the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the
men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
\v 29  And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army,
and come out. 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.\f + \fr 9.30  \ft kindled: or,

\v 31  And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,

\v 32  Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that \add is\add*

\v 33 And it shall be, \add that\add* in the morning, as soon as the

\p
\v 34 ¶ And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that \add were\add*
with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\v 35  And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that
\add were\add* with him, from lying in wait. 
\v 36  And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou
seest the shadow of the mountains as \add if they were\add* men.
\v 37  And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down
by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
plain of Meonenim.\f + \fr 9.37  \ft middle: Heb. navel\f*\f + \fr 9.37 
\ft Meonenim: or, the regarders of times\f* 
\v 38  Then said Zebul unto him, Where \add is\add* now thy mouth,
wherewith thou saidst, Who \add is\add* Abimelech, that we should
serve him? \add is\add* not this the people that thou hast despised?
go out, I pray now, and fight with them. 
\v 39  And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
Abimelech. 
\v 40  And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
were overthrown \add and\add* wounded, \add even\add* unto the entering
of the gate. 
\v 41  And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 
\v 42  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
into the field; and they told Abimelech. 
\v 43  And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people \add were\add*
come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
\v 44  And Abimelech, and the company that \add was\add* with him, rushed
forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the
two \add other\add* companies ran upon all \add the people\add* that
\add were\add* in the fields, and slew them. 
\v 45  And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
took the city, and slew the people that \add was\add* therein, and beat
down the city, and sowed it with salt. 
\p
\v 46 ¶ And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard \add that\add*,
they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. 
\v 47  And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
Shechem were gathered together. 
\v 48  And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that
\add were\add* with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut
down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid \add it\add* on his
shoulder, and said unto the people that \add were\add* with him, What ye have
seen me do, make haste, \add and\add* do as I \add have done\add*.\f + \fr 9.48 
\ft me do: Heb. I have done\f* 
\v 49  And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
and followed Abimelech, and put \add them\add* to the hold, and set
the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
died also, about a thousand men and women. 
\p
\v 50 ¶ Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
and took it. 
\v 51  But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither
fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut \add it\add*
to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. 
\v 52  And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went
hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 
\v 53  And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s
head, and all to brake his skull. 
\v 54  Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A
woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\v 55  And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
departed every man unto his place. 
\p
\v 56 ¶ Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
\v 57  And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their
heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir
in mount Ephraim.\f + \fr 10.1  \ft defend: or, deliver: Heb. save\f*
\v 2  And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
buried in Shamir. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty
and two years. 
\v 4  And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had
thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this day, which
\add are\add* in the land of Gilead.\f + \fr 10.4  \ft Havoth-jair: or, the villages of

\v 5  And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
\nd LORD\nd*, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the
children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the
\nd LORD\nd*, and served not him. 
\v 7  And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hot against Israel, and he
sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the
children of Ammon. 
\v 8  And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
eighteen years, all the children of Israel that \add were\add* on the other
side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which \add is\add* in Gilead.\f + \fr 10.8 
\ft oppressed: Heb. crushed\f* 
\v 9  Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of
Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the children of Israel cried unto the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God,
and also served Baalim. 
\v 11  And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto the children of Israel, \add Did\add* not
\add I deliver you\add* from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites,
from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 
\v 12  The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their
hand. 
\v 13  Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will
deliver you no more. 
\v 14  Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver
you in the time of your tribulation. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And the children of Israel said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, We have
sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver
us only, we pray thee, this day.\f + \fr 10.15  \ft seemeth…: Heb. is good in thine

\v 16  And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served

\ft strange…: Heb. gods of strangers\f*\f + \fr 10.16  \ft grieved: Heb.

\v 17  Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped

and encamped in Mizpeh.\f + \fr 10.17  \ft gathered: Heb. cried\f*
\v 18  And the people \add and\add* princes of Gilead said one to

\c 11  
\p
\v 1  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he

\v 2  And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up,
and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit

\v 3  Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land
of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with

\v 5  And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against
Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land
of Tob: 
\v 6  And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may
fight with the children of Ammon. 
\v 7  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
me, and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in
distress? 
\v 8  And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the
children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
\v 9  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the \nd LORD\nd*
deliver them before me, shall I be your head? 
\v 10  And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The \nd LORD\nd*

\v 11  Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his
words before the \nd LORD\nd* in Mizpeh. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children
of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come
against me to fight in my land? 
\v 13  And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers
of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up
out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those
\add lands\add* again peaceably. 
\v 14  And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children
of Ammon: 
\v 15  And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: 
\v 16  But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 
\v 17  Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying,
Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
would not hearken \add thereto\add*. And in like manner they sent
unto the king of Moab: but he would not \add consent:\add* and Israel
abode in Kadesh. 
\v 18  Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed
the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but
came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon \add was\add* the border
of Moab. 
\v 19  And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy
land into my place. 
\v 20  But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and
fought against Israel. 
\v 21  And the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his
people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed
all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 
\v 22  And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan. 
\v 23  So now the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel hath dispossessed the
Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
\v 24  Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
possess? So whomsoever the \nd LORD\nd* our God shall drive out from
before us, them will we possess. 
\v 25 And now \add art\add* thou any thing better than Balak the
son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he
ever fight against them, 
\v 26  While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer
and her towns, and in all the cities that \add be\add* along by the
coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover
\add them\add* within that time? 
\v 27  Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
wrong to war against me: the \nd LORD\nd* the Judge be judge this
day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. 
\v 28  Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened  not unto the
words of Jephthah which he sent him. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ Then the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came upon Jephthah, and he passed
over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from
Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over \add unto\add* the children of Ammon.
\v 30  And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said,
If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
hands, 
\v 31  Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors
of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
of Ammon, shall surely be the \nd LORD’s\nd*, and I will offer it

\v 36  And she said unto him, My father, \add if\add* thou hast opened

\v 1  And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went

and the \nd LORD\nd* delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come

\v 4  Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they
said, Ye Gileadites \add are\add* fugitives of Ephraim among the

\v 5  And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was

Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, \add Art\add*

\ft How shall we order…: Heb. What shall be the manner of the, etc\f*\f + \fr 13.12

\v 13  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Manoah, Of all that I
said unto the woman let her beware. 
\v 14  She may not eat of any \add thing\add* that cometh of the
vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean
\add thing:\add* all that I commanded her let her observe. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Manoah said unto the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, I pray thee, let us
detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.\f + \fr 13.15 
\ft for thee: Heb. before thee\f* 
\v 16  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto Manoah, Though thou
detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt
offering, thou must offer it unto the \nd LORD\nd*. For Manoah knew not that he
\add was\add* an angel of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 17  And Manoah said unto the angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, What \add is\add*
thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?
\v 18  And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Why askest
thou thus after my name, seeing it \add is\add* secret?\f + \fr 13.18 
\ft secret: or, wonderful\f* 
\v 19  So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered \add it\add*
upon a rock unto the \nd LORD\nd*: and \add the angel\add* did wondrously;
and Manoah and his wife looked on. 
\v 20  For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven
from off the altar, that the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* ascended in the
flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on \add it\add*,
and fell on their faces to the ground. 
\v 21  But the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* did no more appear to Manoah
and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he \add was\add* an angel
of the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have
seen God. 
\v 23  But his wife said unto him, If the \nd LORD\nd* were pleased
to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these
\add things\add*, nor would as at this time have told us \add such
things\add* as these. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
child grew, and the \nd LORD\nd* blessed him. 
\v 25  And the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* began to move him at times
in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.\f + \fr 13.25  \ft the camp…: Heb.

\c 14  
\p
\v 1  And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath
of the daughters of the Philistines. 
\v 2  And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines:
now therefore get her for me to wife. 
\v 3  Then his father and his mother said unto him, \add Is there\add*
never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?
And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me
well.\f + \fr 14.3  \ft pleaseth…: Heb. is right in mine eyes\f*
\v 4  But his father and his mother knew not that it \add was\add*
of the \nd LORD\nd*, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines:
for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,
and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared
against him.\f + \fr 14.5  \ft against…: Heb. in meeting him\f* 
\v 6  And the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came mightily upon him, and he
rent him as he would have rent a kid, and \add he had\add* nothing
in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
done. 
\v 7  And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
Samson well. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, \add there was\add*
a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. 
\v 9  And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he
told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the
lion. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
feast; for so used the young men to do. 
\v 11  And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
thirty companions to be with him. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle
unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
of the feast, and find \add it\add* out, then I will give you thirty
sheets and thirty change of garments:\f + \fr 14.12  \ft sheets: or,

\v 13  But if ye cannot declare \add it\add* me, then shall ye give
me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put
forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.\f + \fr 14.13  \ft sheets: or,
shirts\f* 
\v 14  And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the
strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound
the riddle. 
\v 15  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the
riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye
called us to take that we have? \add is it\add* not \add so\add*?\f + \fr 14.15 
\ft take…: Heb. possess us, or, impoverish us?\f* 
\v 16  And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the
children of my people, and hast not told \add it\add* me. And he
said unto her, Behold, I have not told \add it\add* my father nor my
mother, and shall I tell \add it\add* thee? 
\v 17  And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay
sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.\f + \fr 14.17 
\ft the seven…: or, the rest of the seven days\f* 
\v 18  And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the
sun went down, What \add is\add* sweeter than honey? and what \add is\add*
stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed
with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came upon him, and he went
down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.
And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.\f + \fr 14.19 
\ft spoil: or, apparel\f* 
\v 20  But Samson’s wife was \add given\add* to his companion, whom he had used as his
friend. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go
in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go
in. 
\v 2  And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: \add is\add* not her
younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of
her.\f + \fr 15.2  \ft take…: Heb. let her be thine\f* 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.\f + \fr 15.3 
\ft more…: or, blameless from the Philistines though, etc\f* 
\v 4  And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between
two tails.\f + \fr 15.4  \ft firebrands: or, torches\f* 
\v 5  And when he had set the brands on fire, he let \add them\add*
go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards \add and\add*
olives. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,
and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and
burnt her and her father with fire. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be
avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 
\v 8  And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went
down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
themselves in Lehi. 
\v 10  And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they
answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath
done to us. 
\v 11  Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines \add are\add*
rulers over us? what \add is\add* this \add that\add* thou hast done
unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto
them.\f + \fr 15.11  \ft went: Heb. went down\f* 
\v 12  And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may
deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them,
Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. 
\v 13  And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill
thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the
rock. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ \add And\add* when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted
against him: and the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came mightily upon him, and the
cords that \add were\add* upon his arms became as flax that was burnt
with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.\f + \fr 15.14

\v 16  And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,

\ft heaps upon…: Heb. an heap, two heaps\f* 
\v 17  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking,
that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place
Ramath-lehi.\f + \fr 15.17  \ft Ramath-lehi: that is, the lifting up of the jawbone, or, casting away of the

\p
\v 18 ¶ And he was sore athirst, and called on the \nd LORD\nd*,
and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the
uncircumcised? 
\v 19  But God clave an hollow place that \add was\add* in the jaw,
and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit

\v 20  And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty

\p
\v 1  Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went
in unto her.\f + \fr 16.1  \ft harlot: Heb. a woman an harlot\f*
\v 2  \add And it was told\add* the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed

\v 3  And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took

\v 5  And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said

\p
\v 6 ¶ And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy

to afflict thee. 
\v 7  And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green

\v 9 Now \add there were\add* men lying in wait, abiding with her in the

\v 10  And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and

\v 12  Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and

brake them from off his arms like a thread. 
\v 13  And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said
unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
\v 14  And she fastened \add it\add* with the pin, and said unto him, The

\p
\v 15 ¶ And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine

\p
\v 18  And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up
this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the
Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 
\v 19  And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a

and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 
\v 20  And she said, The Philistines \add be\add* upon thee, Samson.
And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times

\v 24  And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they

\v 25  And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they

once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my

\v 29  And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the

\v 1  In those days \add there was\add* no king in Israel: and in those

\v 2  And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their

\v 19  And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy
mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: \add is
it\add* better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man,
or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? 
\v 20  And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the
teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
\v 21  So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
cattle and the carriage before them. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ \add And\add* when they were a good way from the house of
Micah, the men that \add were\add* in the houses near to Micah’s
house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. 
\v 23  And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a
company?\f + \fr 18.23  \ft comest…: Heb. art gathered together?\f*
\v 24  And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what \add is\add* this
\add that\add* ye say unto me, What aileth thee? 
\v 25  And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy
life, with the lives of thy household.\f + \fr 18.25  \ft angry: Heb. bitter of
soul\f* 
\v 26  And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they
\add were\add* too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his
house. 
\p
\v 27  And they took \add the things\add* which Micah had made, and the
priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people \add that
were\add* at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge
of the sword, and burnt the city with fire. 
\v 28 And \add there was\add* no deliverer, because it \add was\add*
far from Zidon, and they had no business with \add any\add* man;
and it was in the valley that \add lieth\add* by Beth-rehob. And they
built a city, and dwelt therein. 
\v 29  And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the
city \add was\add* Laish at the first. 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests
to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
\v 31  And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made,
all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in those days, when \add there was\add*
no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the
side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.\f + \fr 19.1 
\ft a concubine: Heb. a woman a concubine, or, a wife a concubine\f*
\v 2  And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
from him unto her father’s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there
four whole months.\f + \fr 19.2  \ft four whole months: or, a year and four month: Heb. days, four
months\f* 
\v 3  And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her,
\add and\add* to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a
couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the
father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.\f + \fr 19.3 
\ft friendly…: Heb. to her heart\f* 
\v 4  And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he
abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father
said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread,
and afterward go your way.\f + \fr 19.5  \ft Comfort: Heb. Strengthen\f*
\v 6  And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:
for the damsel’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all
night, and let thine heart be merry. 
\v 7  And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
him: therefore he lodged there again. 
\v 8  And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart:
and the damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they
tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.\f + \fr 19.8 
\ft until afternoon: Heb. till the day declined\f* 
\v 9  And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine,
and his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the
day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the
day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry;
and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.\f + \fr 19.9

day\f*\f + \fr 19.9  \ft home: Heb. to thy tent\f* 
\v 10  But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
departed, and came over against Jebus, which \add is\add* Jerusalem; and
\add there were\add* with him two asses saddled, his concubine also
\add was\add* with him.\f + \fr 19.10  \ft over against: Heb. to over

\v 11  \add And\add* when they \add were\add* by Jebus, the day was
far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn
in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. 
\v 12  And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the
city of a stranger, that \add is\add* not of the children of Israel;
we will pass over to Gibeah. 
\v 13  And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 
\v 14  And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them
\add when they were\add* by Gibeah, which \add belongeth\add* to
Benjamin. 
\v 15  And they turned aside thither, to go in \add and\add* to lodge
in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the
city: for \add there was\add* no man that took them into his house
to lodging. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
field at even, which \add was\add* also of mount Ephraim; and he
sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place \add were\add* Benjamites.
\v 17  And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man
in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and
whence comest thou? 
\v 18  And he said unto him, We \add are\add* passing from Beth-lehem-judah
toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence \add am\add* I: and I
went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I \add am now\add* going to the house
of the \nd LORD\nd*; and there \add is\add* no man that receiveth
me to house.\f + \fr 19.18  \ft receiveth: Heb. gathereth\f* 
\v 19  Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is
bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young
man \add which is\add* with thy servants: \add there is\add* no want
of any thing. 
\v 20  And the old man said, Peace \add be\add* with thee; howsoever
\add let\add* all thy wants \add lie\add* upon me; only lodge not in the
street. 
\v 21  So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ \add Now\add* as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the
men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
\add and\add* beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house,
that we may know him. 
\v 23  And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
said unto them, Nay, my brethren, \add nay\add*, I pray you, do not
\add so\add* wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house,
do not this folly. 
\v 24 Behold, \add here is\add* my daughter a maiden, and his concubine;
them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what
seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.\f + \fr 19.24 
\ft so vile…: Heb. the matter of this folly\f* 
\v 25  But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and
abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to
spring, they let her go. 
\v 26  Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
at the door of the man’s house where her lord \add was\add*, till it was
light. 
\v 27  And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors
of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
his concubine was fallen down \add at\add* the door of the house,
and her hands \add were\add* upon the threshold. 
\v 28  And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.
Then the man took her \add up\add* upon an ass, and the man rose
up, and gat him unto his place. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
hold on his concubine, and divided her, \add together\add* with her
bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.
\v 30  And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came
up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider  of it, take
advice, and speak \add your minds\add*. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the
land of Gilead, unto the \nd LORD\nd* in Mizpeh. 
\v 2  And the chief of all the people, \add even\add* of all the
tribes of Israel, presented  themselves in the assembly of the people
of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword. 
\v 3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell \add us\add*,
how was this wickedness? 
\v 4  And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered
and said, I came into Gibeah that \add belongeth\add* to Benjamin,
I and my concubine, to lodge.\f + \fr 20.4  \ft the Levite: Heb. the man the

\v 5  And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
round about upon me by night, \add and\add* thought to have slain
me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.\f + \fr 20.5 
\ft forced: Heb. humbled\f* 
\v 6  And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the
country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness
and folly in Israel. 
\v 7 Behold, ye \add are\add* all children of Israel; give here your
advice and counsel. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
\add of us\add* go to his tent, neither will we any \add of us\add*
turn into his house. 
\v 9 But now this \add shall be\add* the thing which we will do to
Gibeah; \add we will go up\add* by lot against it; 
\v 10  And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten
thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they
come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have
wrought in Israel. 
\v 11  So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
together as one man.\f + \fr 20.11  \ft knit…: Heb. fellows\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
Benjamin, saying, What wickedness \add is\add* this that is done among you?
\v 13  Now therefore deliver \add us\add* the men, the children of
Belial, which \add are\add* in Gibeah, that we may put them to death,
and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would
not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:
\v 14  But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children
of Israel. 
\v 15  And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the
cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants
of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 
\v 16  Among all this people \add there were\add* seven hundred chosen
men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair \add breadth\add*,
and not miss. 
\v 17  And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these \add were\add* men
of war. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house
of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the
\nd LORD\nd* said, Judah \add shall go up\add* first. 
\v 19  And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
against Gibeah. 
\v 20  And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin;
and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at
Gibeah. 
\v 21  And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed
down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand
men. 
\v 22  And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their
battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array
the first day. 
\v 23 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the \nd LORD\nd*
until even, and asked counsel of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I go
up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the
\nd LORD\nd* said, Go up against him.) 
\v 24  And the children of Israel came near against the children
of Benjamin the second day. 
\v 25  And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again
eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 
\p
\v 26 ¶ Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went
up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
the \nd LORD\nd*, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 27  And the children of Israel enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, (for the
ark of the covenant of God \add was\add* there in those days, 
\v 28  And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle
against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the
\nd LORD\nd* said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine
hand. 
\v 29  And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. 
\v 30  And the children of Israel went up against the children of
Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah,
as at other times. 
\v 31  And the children of Benjamin went out against the people,
\add and\add* were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite
of the people, \add and\add* kill, as at other times, in the highways,

\v 32  And the children of Benjamin said, They \add are\add* smitten
down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways. 
\v 33  And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in
array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their
places, \add even\add* out of the meadows of Gibeah. 
\v 34  And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil \add was\add*
near them. 
\v 35  And the \nd LORD\nd* smote Benjamin before Israel: and the
children of Israel destroyed  of the Benjamites that day twenty and
five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword. 
\v 36  So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the
men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted
unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah. 
\v 37  And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in
wait drew \add themselves\add* along, and smote all the city with the

\v 42  Therefore they turned \add their backs\add* before the men

\v 43  \add Thus\add* they inclosed the Benjamites round about, \add and\add*

\v 45  And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand
men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand
men of them. 
\v 46  So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
five thousand men that drew the sword; all these \add were\add* men
of valour. 
\v 47  But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. 
\v 48  And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin,
and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of \add every\add*

\p
\v 1  Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not
any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 
\v 2  And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 
\v 3  And said, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?
\v 4  And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
\v 5  And the children of Israel said, Who \add is there\add* among all the
tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the
\nd LORD\nd*? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not
up to the \nd LORD\nd* to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to
death. 
\v 6  And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
\v 7  How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
sworn by the \nd LORD\nd* that we will not give them of our daughters
to wives? 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And they said, What one \add is there\add* of the tribes of
Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the \nd LORD\nd*? And, behold, there
came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. 
\v 9  For the people were numbered, and, behold, \add there were\add*
none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. 
\v 10  And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants
of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the
children. 
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.\f + \fr 21.11 
\ft hath lain…: Heb. knoweth the lying with man\f* 
\v 12  And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four

and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which \add is\add*
in the land of Canaan.\f + \fr 21.12  \ft young…: Heb. young women

\v 13  And the whole congregation sent \add some\add* to speak to the

\v 14  And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they
sufficed them not. 
\v 15  And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
\nd LORD\nd* had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do
for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of
Benjamin? 
\v 17  And they said, \add There must be\add* an inheritance for them that be
escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
\v 18  Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed \add be\add* he that
giveth a wife to Benjamin. 
\v 19  Then they said, Behold, \add there is\add* a feast of the
\nd LORD\nd* in Shiloh yearly \add in a place\add* which \add is\add*
on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth

\v 20  Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying,
Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; 
\v 21  And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out
to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the
land of Benjamin. 
\v 22  And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we
reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give
unto them at this time, \add that\add* ye should be guilty.\f + \fr 21.22 
\ft Be favourable…: or, Gratify us in them\f* 
\v 23  And the children of Benjamin did so, and took \add them\add*
wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired
the cities, and dwelt in them. 
\v 24  And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every
man to his inheritance. 
\v 25  In those days \add there was\add* no king in Israel: every
man did \add that which was\add* right in his own eyes.
