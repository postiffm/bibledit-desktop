\v 1  The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord \nd GOD\nd* concerning
Edom; We have heard a rumour from the \nd LORD\nd*, and an ambassador
is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in
battle. 
\v 2  Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
greatly despised. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest
in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation \add is\add* high; that
saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? 
\v 4  Though thou exalt \add thyself\add* as the eagle, and though thou
set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 5  If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut
off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers
came to thee, would they not leave \add some\add* grapes?\f + \fr 1.5 
\ft some…: or, gleanings?\f* 
\v 6 How are \add the things\add* of Esau searched out! \add how\add*
are his hidden things sought up! 
\v 7  All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee \add even\add*
to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee,
\add and\add* prevailed against thee; \add they that eat\add* thy
bread have laid a wound under thee: \add there is\add* none understanding in
him.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft that were…: Heb. of thy peace\f*\f + \fr 1.7 
\ft they…: Heb. the men of thy bread\f*\f + \fr 1.7  \ft in him: or, of
it\f* 
\v 8  Shall I not in that day, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, even destroy
the wise \add men\add* out of Edom, and understanding out of the
mount of Esau? 
\v 9  And thy mighty \add men\add*, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every
one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ For \add thy\add* violence against thy brother Jacob shame
shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. 
\v 11  In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners
entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou \add wast\add*
as one of them.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft captive…: or, his substance\f*
\v 12  But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have
rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction;
neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.\f + \fr 1.12 
\ft spoken…: Heb. magnified thy mouth\f* 
\v 13  Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people
in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid \add hands\add*
on their substance in the day of their calamity;\f + \fr 1.13  \ft substance: or,
forces\f* 
\v 14  Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut
off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered
up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.\f + \fr 1.14 
\ft delivered up: or, shut up\f* 
\v 15  For the day of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* near upon all the
heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward
shall return upon thine own head. 
\v 16  For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, \add so\add* shall all the
heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow
down, and they shall be as though they had not been.\f + \fr 1.16 
\ft swallow…: or, sup up\f* 
\p
\v 17 ¶ But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.\f + \fr 1.17 
\ft deliverance: or, they that escape\f*\f + \fr 1.17  \ft there…: or, it shall be
holy\f* 
\v 18  And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph
a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle
in them, and devour them; and there shall not be \add any\add* remaining
of the house of Esau; for the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken \add it\add*.
\v 19 And \add they of\add* the south shall possess the mount of
Esau; and \add they of\add* the plain the Philistines: and they shall
possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
\add shall possess\add* Gilead. 
\v 20  And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel \add shall
possess\add* that of the Canaanites, \add even\add* unto Zarephath;
and the captivity of Jerusalem, which \add is\add* in Sepharad, shall
possess the cities of the south.\f + \fr 1.20  \ft which…: or, shall possess that which is
in\f* 
\v 21  And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount
of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the \nd LORD’s\nd*.
