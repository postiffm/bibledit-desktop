\mt1 THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES 
\c 1  
\p
\v 1  The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that
Jesus began both to do and teach, 
\v 2  Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through
the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had
chosen: 
\v 3  To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining
to the kingdom of God: 
\v 4  And, being assembled together with \add them\add*, commanded
them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, \wj  but wait for
the promise of the Father, which,\wj* \add saith he\add*, \wj  ye have
heard of me.\wj* 
\v 5  \wj  For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.\wj* 
\v 6  When they therefore were come together, they asked of him,
saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to
Israel? 
\v 7  And he said unto them, \wj  It is not for you to know the times
or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.\wj* 
\v 8  \wj  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost
is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
and in all Judæa, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
earth.\wj* 
\v 9  And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he
was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
\v 10  And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went
up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 
\v 11  Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up
into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
\v 12  Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey. 
\v 13  And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip,
and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James \add the son\add* of
Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas \add the brother\add* of James.
\v 14  These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and
twenty,) 
\v 16  Men \add and\add* brethren, this scripture must needs have been
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before
concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. 
\v 17  For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
ministry. 
\v 18  Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity;
and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his
bowels gushed out. 
\v 19  And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch
as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to
say, The field of blood. 
\v 20  For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation
be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let
another take. 
\v 21  Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the
time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
\v 22  Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that
he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with
us of his resurrection. 
\v 23  And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
Justus, and Matthias. 
\v 24  And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts
of all \add men\add*, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,
\v 25  That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
\v 26  And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
with one accord in one place. 
\v 2  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\v 3  And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
and it sat upon each of them. 
\v 4  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 
\v 5  And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out
of every nation under heaven. 
\v 6  Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his
own language. 
\v 7  And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
Behold, are not all these which speak Galilæans? 
\v 8  And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
born? 
\v 9  Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia,
and in Judæa, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 
\v 10  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, 
\v 11  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues
the wonderful works of God. 
\v 12  And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
another, What meaneth this? 
\v 13  Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
and said unto them, Ye men of Judæa, and all \add ye\add* that dwell
at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 
\v 15  For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is \add but\add*
the third hour of the day. 
\v 16  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 
\v 17  And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour
out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old
men shall dream dreams: 
\v 18  And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: 
\v 19  And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the
earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 
\v 20  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
before that great and notable day of the Lord come: 
\v 21  And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whosoever shall call
on the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
\v 22  Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which
God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 
\v 23  Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
\v 24  Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. 
\v 25  For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be
moved: 
\v 26  Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover
also my flesh shall rest in hope: 
\v 27  Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
\v 28  Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make
me full of joy with thy countenance. 
\v 29  Men \add and\add* brethren, let me freely speak unto you of
the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre
is with us unto this day. 
\v 30  Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn
with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to
the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 
\v 31  He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
\v 32  This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
\v 33  Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed
forth this, which ye now see and hear. 
\v 34  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,
The \nd LORD\nd* said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
\v 35  Until I make thy foes thy footstool. 
\v 36  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that
God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord
and Christ. 
\p
\v 37 ¶ Now when they heard \add this\add*, they were pricked in their
heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men \add and\add*
brethren, what shall we do? 
\v 38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and
ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
\v 39  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to
all that are afar off, \add even\add* as many as the Lord our God
shall call. 
\v 40  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
Save yourselves from this untoward generation. 
\p
\v 41 ¶ Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and
the same day there were added \add unto them\add* about three thousand
souls. 
\v 42  And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and
fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 
\v 43  And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs
were done by the apostles. 
\v 44  And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
\v 45  And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
\add men\add*, as every man had need. 
\v 46  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple,
and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness
and singleness of heart, 
\v 47  Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
hour of prayer, \add being\add* the ninth \add hour\add*. 
\v 2  And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried,
whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful,
to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
\v 3  Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked
an alms. 
\v 4  And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
on us. 
\v 5  And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something
of them. 
\v 6  Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
and walk. 
\v 7  And he took him by the right hand, and lifted \add him\add*
up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength. 
\v 8  And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
\v 9  And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 
\v 10  And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful
gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement
at that which had happened unto him. 
\v 11  And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John,
all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
Solomon’s, greatly wondering. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when Peter saw \add it\add*, he answered unto the people,
Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly
on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man
to walk? 
\v 13  The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of
our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up,
and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined
to let \add him\add* go. 
\v 14  But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you; 
\v 15  And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
dead; whereof we are witnesses. 
\v 16  And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath
given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
\v 17  And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did \add it\add*,
as \add did\add* also your rulers. 
\v 18  But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth
of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
Lord; 
\v 20  And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached
unto you: 
\v 21  Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began. 
\v 22  For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the
Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him
shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. 
\v 23  And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every soul, which
will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
\v 24  Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
\v 25  Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall
all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 
\v 26  Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain
of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 
\v 2  Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through
Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
\v 3  And they laid hands on them, and put \add them\add* in hold
unto the next day: for it was now eventide. 
\v 4  Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the
number of the men was about five thousand. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and
elders, and scribes, 
\v 6  And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander,
and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together
at Jerusalem. 
\v 7  And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
power, or by what name, have ye done this? 
\v 8  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 
\v 9  If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent
man, by what means he is made whole; 
\v 10  Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,
that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,
whom God raised from the dead, \add even\add* by him doth this man
stand here before you whole. 
\v 11  This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
which is become the head of the corner. 
\v 12  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took
knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
\v 14  And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
they could say nothing against it. 
\v 15  But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
they conferred among themselves, 
\v 16  Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable
miracle hath been done by them \add is\add* manifest to all them
that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot  deny \add it\add*. 
\v 17  But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
\v 18  And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all
nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
\v 19  But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it
be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,
judge ye. 
\v 20  For we cannot  but speak the things which we have seen and
heard. 
\v 21  So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people:
for all \add men\add* glorified God for that which was done. 
\v 22  For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle
of healing was shewed. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 
\v 24  And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God
with one accord, and said, Lord, thou \add art\add* God, which hast
made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: 
\v 25  Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? 
\v 26  The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 
\v 27  For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and
the people of Israel, were gathered together, 
\v 28  For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before
to be done. 
\v 29  And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 
\v 30  By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and
wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they
were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,
and they spake the word of God with boldness. 
\v 32  And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart
and of one soul: neither said any \add of them\add* that ought of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 
\v 33  And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 
\v 34  Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many
as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the
prices of the things that were sold, 
\v 35  And laid \add them\add* down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was
made unto every man according as he had need. 
\v 36  And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which
is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, \add and\add*
of the country of Cyprus, 
\v 37  Having land, sold \add it\add*, and brought the money, and
laid \add it\add* at the apostles’ feet. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold
a possession, 
\v 2  And kept back \add part\add* of the price, his wife also being
privy \add to it\add*, and brought a certain part, and laid \add it\add*
at the apostles’ feet. 
\v 3  But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart
to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back \add part\add* of the
price of the land? 
\v 4  Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was
sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this
thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
\v 5  And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the
ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. 
\v 6  And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried \add him\add*
out, and buried \add him\add*. 
\v 7  And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,
not knowing what was done, came in. 
\v 8  And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land
for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. 
\v 9  Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have
buried thy husband \add are\add* at the door, and shall carry thee
out. 
\v 10  Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying
\add her\add* forth, buried \add her\add* by her husband. 
\v 11  And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many
as heard these things. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s
porch. 
\v 13  And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
people magnified them. 
\v 14  And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes
both of men and women.) 
\v 15  Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
and laid \add them\add* on beds and couches, that at the least the
shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. 
\v 16  There came also a multitude \add out\add* of the cities round
about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed
with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with
him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,
\v 18  And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the
common prison. 
\v 19  But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors,
and brought them forth, and said, 
\v 20  Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words
of this life. 
\v 21  And when they heard \add that\add*, they entered into the
temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came,
and they that were with him, and called the council together, and
all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison
to have them brought. 
\v 22  But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
they returned, and told, 
\v 23  Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and
the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened,
we found no man within. 
\v 24  Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and
the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto
this would grow. 
\v 25  Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom
ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
\v 26  Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been
stoned. 
\v 27  And when they had brought them, they set \add them\add* before
the council: and the high priest asked them, 
\v 28  Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not
teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your
doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us. 
\p
\v 29 ¶ Then Peter and the \add other\add* apostles answered and
said, We ought to obey God rather than men. 
\v 30  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
on a tree. 
\v 31  Him hath God exalted with his right hand \add to be\add* a
Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness
of sins. 
\v 32  And we are his witnesses of these things; and \add so is\add*
also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. 
\p
\v 33 ¶ When they heard \add that\add*, they were cut \add to the
heart\add*, and took counsel to slay them. 
\v 34  Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and
commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 
\v 35  And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
what ye intend to do as touching these men. 
\v 36  For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to
be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered,
and brought to nought. 
\v 37  After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and
all, \add even\add* as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 
\v 38  And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to
nought: 
\v 39  But if it be of God, ye cannot  overthrow it; lest haply ye be
found even to fight against God. 
\v 40  And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
and beaten \add them\add*, they commanded that they should not speak
in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
\p
\v 41 ¶ And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. 
\v 42  And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not
to teach and preach Jesus Christ. 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied,
there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because
their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
\v 2  Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples \add unto
them\add*, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word
of God, and serve tables. 
\v 3  Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over
this business. 
\v 4  But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
ministry of the word. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and
Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte
of Antioch: 
\v 6  Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed,
they laid \add their\add* hands on them. 
\v 7  And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests
were obedient to the faith. 
\v 8  And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
miracles among the people. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called
\add the synagogue\add* of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians,
and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. 
\v 10  And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit
by which he spake. 
\v 11  Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses, and \add against\add* God. 
\v 12  And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
and came upon \add him\add*, and caught him, and brought \add him\add*
to the council, 
\v 13  And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
\v 14  For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered
us. 
\v 15  And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him,
saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 
\v 2  And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of
glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
before he dwelt in Charran, 
\v 3  And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. 
\v 4  Then came he out of the land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in
Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him
into this land, wherein ye now dwell. 
\v 5  And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not \add so much
as\add* to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it
to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when \add as
yet\add* he had no child. 
\v 6  And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in
a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and
entreat \add them\add* evil four hundred years. 
\v 7  And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge,
said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this
place. 
\v 8  And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so \add Abraham\add*
begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac \add begat\add*
Jacob; and Jacob \add begat\add* the twelve patriarchs. 
\v 9  And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt:
but God was with him, 
\v 10  And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him
favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made
him governor over Egypt and all his house. 
\v 11  Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. 
\v 12  But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent
out our fathers first. 
\v 13  And at the second \add time\add* Joseph was made known to
his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. 
\v 14  Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to \add him\add*,
and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. 
\v 15  So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
\v 16  And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor \add the
father\add* of Sychem. 
\v 17  But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had
sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
\v 18  Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph. 
\v 19  The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated
our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end
they might not live. 
\v 20  In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
nourished up in his father’s house three months: 
\v 21  And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and
nourished him for her own son. 
\v 22  And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
and was mighty in words and in deeds. 
\v 23  And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart
to visit his brethren the children of Israel. 
\v 24  And seeing one \add of them\add* suffer wrong, he defended
\add him\add*, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the
Egyptian: 
\v 25  For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that
God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. 
\v 26  And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove,
and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren;
why do ye wrong one to another? 
\v 27  But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying,
Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
\v 28  Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
\v 29  Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the
land of Madian, where he begat two sons. 
\v 30  And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in
the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire
in a bush. 
\v 31  When Moses saw \add it\add*, he wondered at the sight: and
as he drew near to behold \add it\add*, the voice of the Lord came
unto him, 
\v 32  \add Saying\add*, I \add am\add* the God of thy fathers, the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then
Moses trembled, and durst not behold. 
\v 33  Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet:
for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
\v 34  I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which
is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to
deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. 
\v 35  This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler
and a judge? the same did God send \add to be\add* a ruler and a
deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36  He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and
signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness
forty years. 
\p
\v 37 ¶ This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel,
A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,
like unto me; him shall ye hear. 
\v 38  This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with
the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and \add with\add*
our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: 
\v 39  To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust \add him\add*
from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, 
\v 40  Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for \add as
for\add* this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we
wot not what is become of him. 
\v 41  And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice
unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. 
\v 42  Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel,
have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices \add by the space
of\add* forty years in the wilderness? 
\v 43  Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of
your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will
carry you away beyond Babylon. 
\v 44  Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it
according to the fashion that he had seen. 
\v 45  Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus
into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the
face of our fathers, unto the days of David; 
\v 46  Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle
for the God of Jacob. 
\v 47  But Solomon built him an house. 
\v 48  Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
as saith the prophet, 
\v 49  Heaven \add is\add* my throne, and earth \add is\add* my footstool:
what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what \add is\add*
the place of my rest? 
\v 50  Hath not my hand made all these things? 
\p
\v 51 ¶ Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers \add did\add*, so \add do\add*
ye. 
\v 52  Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and
they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just
One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 
\v 53  Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and
have not kept \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 54 ¶ When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,
and they gnashed on him with \add their\add* teeth. 
\v 55  But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right
hand of God, 
\v 56  And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of
man standing on the right hand of God. 
\v 57  Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
and ran upon him with one accord, 
\v 58  And cast \add him\add* out of the city, and stoned \add him\add*:
and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet,
whose name was Saul. 
\v 59  And they stoned Stephen, calling upon \add God\add*, and saying,
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 
\v 60  And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell
asleep. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem;
and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judæa
and Samaria, except the apostles. 
\v 2  And devout men carried Stephen \add to his burial\add*, and
made great lamentation over him. 
\v 3  As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women committed \add them\add* to prison.
\v 4  Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
preaching the word. 
\v 5  Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
Christ unto them. 
\v 6  And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
\v 7  For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
that were possessed \add with them\add*: and many taken with palsies,
and that were lame, were healed. 
\v 8  And there was great joy in that city. 
\v 9  But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime
in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria,
giving out that himself was some great one: 
\v 10  To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
saying, This man is the great power of God. 
\v 11  And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries. 
\v 12  But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
both men and women. 
\v 13  Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized,
he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and
signs which were done. 
\v 14  Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
\v 15  Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
receive the Holy Ghost: 
\v 16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
\v 17  Then laid they \add their\add* hands on them, and they received
the Holy Ghost. 
\v 18  And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’
hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
\v 19  Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay
hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
\v 20  But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
\v 21  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart
is not right in the sight of God. 
\v 22  Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if
perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
\v 23  For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and
\add in\add* the bond of iniquity. 
\v 24  Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me,
that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
\v 25  And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages
of the Samaritans. 
\v 26  And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise,
and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem
unto Gaza, which is desert. 
\v 27  And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians,
who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem
for to worship, 
\v 28  Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet. 
\v 29  Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself
to this chariot. 
\v 30  And Philip ran thither to \add him\add*, and heard him read
the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
\v 31  And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And
he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 
\v 32  The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was
led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his
shearer, so opened he not his mouth: 
\v 33  In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 
\v 34  And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of
whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
\v 35  Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
and preached unto him Jesus. 
\v 36  And as they went on \add their\add* way, they came unto a
certain water: and the eunuch said, See, \add here is\add* water;
what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
\v 37  And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is
the Son of God. 
\v 38  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized
him. 
\v 39  And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he
went on his way rejoicing. 
\v 40  But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached
in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
\v 2  And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that
if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might
bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 
\v 3  And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round
about him a light from heaven: 
\v 4  And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
\wj  Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\wj* 
\v 5  And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, \wj  I
am Jesus whom thou persecutest: \+add it is\+add* hard for thee to
kick against the pricks.\wj* 
\v 6  And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
have me to do? And the Lord \add said\add* unto him, \wj  Arise,
and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.\wj*
\v 7  And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing
a voice, but seeing no man. 
\v 8  And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought \add him\add*
into Damascus. 
\v 9  And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
drink. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
and to him said the Lord in a vision, \wj  Ananias.\wj* And he said,
Behold, I \add am here\add*, Lord. 
\v 11  And the Lord \add said\add* unto him, \wj  Arise, and go into
the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of
Judas for \+add one\+add* called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he
prayeth,\wj* 
\v 12  \wj  And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming
in, and putting \+add his\+add* hand on him, that he might receive his
sight.\wj* 
\v 13  Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this
man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
\v 14  And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind
all that call on thy name. 
\v 15  But the Lord said unto him, \wj  Go thy way: for he is a chosen
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and
the children of Israel:\wj* 
\v 16  \wj  For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for
my name’s sake.\wj* 
\v 17  And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, \add even\add*
Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent
me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the
Holy Ghost. 
\v 18  And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. 
\v 19  And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was
Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. 
\v 20  And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that
he is the Son of God. 
\v 21  But all that heard \add him\add* were amazed, and said; Is
not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto
the chief priests? 
\v 22  But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the
Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel
to kill him: 
\v 24  But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched
the gates day and night to kill him. 
\v 25  Then the disciples took him by night, and let \add him\add*
down by the wall in a basket. 
\v 26  And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not
that he was a disciple. 
\v 27  But Barnabas took him, and brought \add him\add* to the apostles,
and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that
he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus
in the name of Jesus. 
\v 28  And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
\v 29  And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
\v 30  \add Which\add* when the brethren knew, they brought him down
to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
\v 31  Then had the churches rest throughout all Judæa and Galilee
and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord,
and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all \add quarters\add*,
he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 
\v 33  And there he found a certain man named Æneas, which had kept
his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 
\v 34  And Peter said unto him, Æneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:
arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
\v 35  And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned
to the Lord. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,
which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of
good works and almsdeeds which she did. 
\v 37  And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and
died: whom when they had washed, they laid \add  her\add* in an upper
chamber. 
\v 38  And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples
had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring
\add him\add* that he would not delay to come to them. 
\v 39  Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought
him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping,
and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was
with them. 
\v 40  But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
and turning \add him\add* to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she
opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
\v 41  And he gave her \add his\add* hand, and lifted her up, and
when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive. 
\v 42  And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in
the Lord. 
\v 43  And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with
one Simon a tanner. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  There was a certain man in Cæsarea called Cornelius, a centurion
of the band called the Italian \add band\add*, 
\v 2  \add A\add* devout \add man\add*, and one that feared God with
all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to
God alway. 
\v 3  He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
\v 4  And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is
it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come
up for a memorial before God. 
\v 5  And now send men to Joppa, and call for \add one\add* Simon,
whose surname is Peter: 
\v 6  He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea
side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. 
\v 7  And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed,
he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of
them that waited on him continually; 
\v 8  And when he had declared all \add these\add* things unto them,
he sent them to Joppa. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the
sixth hour: 
\v 10  And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
they made ready, he fell into a trance, 
\v 11  And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto
him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let
down to the earth: 
\v 12  Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth,
and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 
\v 13  And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
\v 14  But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
that is common or unclean. 
\v 15  And the voice \add spake\add* unto him again the second time,
What God hath cleansed, \add that\add* call not thou common. 
\v 16  This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
into heaven. 
\v 17  Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which
he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius
had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate, 
\v 18  And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter,
were lodged there. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
Behold, three men seek thee. 
\v 20  Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
nothing: for I have sent them. 
\v 21  Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what \add is\add*
the cause wherefore ye are come? 
\v 22  And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that
feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews,
was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house,
and to hear words of thee. 
\v 23  Then called he them in, and lodged \add them\add*. And on the
morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa
accompanied him. 
\v 24  And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius
waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
\v 25  And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down
at his feet, and worshipped \add him\add*. 
\v 26  But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am
a man. 
\v 27  And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come
together. 
\v 28  And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another
nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common
or unclean. 
\v 29  Therefore came I \add unto you\add* without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent
for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? 
\v 30  And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this
hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a
man stood before me in bright clothing, 
\v 31  And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in
remembrance in the sight of God. 
\v 32  Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname
is Peter; he is lodged in the house of \add one\add* Simon a tanner
by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. 
\v 33  Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before
God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. 
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then Peter opened \add his\add* mouth, and said, Of a truth
I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: 
\v 35  But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness,
is accepted with him. 
\v 36  The word which \add God\add* sent unto the children of Israel,
preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) 
\v 37  That word, \add I say\add*, ye know, which was published throughout
all Judæa, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
\v 38  How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth  with the Holy Ghost and
with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 
\v 39  And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on
a tree: 
\v 40  Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 
\v 41  Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of
God, \add even\add* to us, who did eat and drink with him after he
rose from the dead. 
\v 42  And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
that it is he which was ordained of God \add to be\add* the Judge
of quick and dead. 
\v 43  To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. 
\p
\v 44 ¶ While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on
all them which heard the word. 
\v 45  And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured
out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
\v 46  For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
answered Peter, 
\v 47  Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? 
\v 48  And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1  And the apostles and brethren that were in Judæa heard that
the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
\v 2  And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of
the circumcision contended with him, 
\v 3  Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
with them. 
\v 4  But Peter rehearsed \add the matter\add* from the beginning,
and expounded \add it\add* by order unto them, saying, 
\v 5  I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let
down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: 
\v 6  Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping
things, and fowls of the air. 
\v 7  And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
eat. 
\v 8  But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any
time entered into my mouth. 
\v 9  But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
cleansed, \add that\add* call not thou common. 
\v 10  And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
into heaven. 
\v 11  And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
unto the house where I was, sent from Cæsarea unto me. 
\v 12  And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s
house: 
\v 13  And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which
stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname
is Peter; 
\v 14  Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
shall be saved. 
\v 15  And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on
us at the beginning. 
\v 16  Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said,
\wj  John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
the Holy Ghost.\wj* 
\v 17  Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as \add he did\add*
unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I
could withstand God? 
\v 18  When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified
God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance
unto life. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution
that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus,
and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. 
\v 20  And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were
come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
\v 21  And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
believed, and turned unto the Lord. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should
go as far as Antioch. 
\v 23  Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave
unto the Lord. 
\v 24  For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
and much people was added unto the Lord. 
\v 25  Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 
\v 26  And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And
it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called
Christians first in Antioch. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
\v 28  And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified
by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the
world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Cæsar. 
\v 29  Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined
to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judæa: 
\v 30  Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands
of Barnabas and Saul. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth \add his\add*
hands to vex certain of the church. 
\v 2  And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. 
\v 3  And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) 
\v 4  And when he had apprehended him, he put \add him\add* in prison,
and delivered \add him\add* to four quaternions of soldiers to keep
him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. 
\v 5  Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
ceasing of the church unto God for him. 
\v 6  And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and
the keepers before the door kept the prison. 
\v 7  And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon \add him\add*,
and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side,
and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell
off from \add his\add* hands. 
\v 8  And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about
thee, and follow me. 
\v 9  And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. 
\v 10  When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them
of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street;
and forthwith the angel departed from him. 
\v 11  And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of
a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me
out of the hand of Herod, and \add from\add* all the expectation
of the people of the Jews. 
\v 12  And when he had considered \add the thing\add*, he came to
the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where
many were gathered together praying. 
\v 13  And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came
to hearken, named Rhoda. 
\v 14  And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for
gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. 
\v 15  And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed
that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. 
\v 16  But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened \add the
door\add*, and saw him, they were astonished. 
\v 17  But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.
And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren.
And he departed, and went into another place. 
\v 18  Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
soldiers, what was become of Peter. 
\v 19  And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined
the keepers, and commanded that \add they\add* should be put to death.
And he went down from Judæa to Cæsarea, and \add there\add* abode.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the
king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country
was nourished by the king’s \add country\add*. 
\v 21  And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon
his throne, and made an oration unto them. 
\v 22  And the people gave a shout, \add saying, It is\add* the voice
of a god, and not of a man. 
\v 23  And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he
gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the
ghost. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ But the word of God grew and multiplied. 
\v 25  And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
fulfilled \add their\add* ministry, and took with them John, whose surname
was Mark. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and
Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod
the tetrarch, and Saul. 
\v 2  As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
called them. 
\v 3  And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid \add their\add*
hands on them, they sent \add them\add* away. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. 
\v 5  And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God
in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to \add their\add*
minister. 
\v 6  And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found
a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name \add was\add*
Bar-jesus: 
\v 7  Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear
the word of God. 
\v 8  But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
\v 9  Then Saul, (who also \add is called\add* Paul,) filled with
the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, 
\v 10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, \add thou\add*
child of the devil, \add thou\add* enemy of all righteousness, wilt
thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
\v 11  And now, behold, the hand of the Lord \add is\add* upon thee,
and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately
there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking
some to lead him by the hand. 
\v 12  Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. 
\v 13  Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came
to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat
down. 
\v 15  And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the
synagogue sent unto them, saying, \add Ye\add* men \add and\add*
brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say
on. 
\v 16  Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with \add his\add* hand
said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. 
\v 17  The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted
the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and
with an high arm brought he them out of it. 
\v 18  And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners
in the wilderness. 
\v 19  And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
he divided their land to them by lot. 
\v 20  And after that he gave \add unto them\add* judges about the space
of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. 
\v 21  And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them
Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of
forty years. 
\v 22  And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David
to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have
found David the \add son\add* of Jesse, a man after mine own heart,
which shall fulfil all my will. 
\v 23  Of this man’s seed hath God according to \add his\add* promise
raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: 
\v 24  When John had first preached before his coming the baptism
of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
\v 25  And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that
I am? I am not \add he\add*. But, behold, there cometh one after
me, whose shoes of \add his\add* feet I am not worthy to loose. 
\v 26  Men \add and\add* brethren, children of the stock of Abraham,
and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation
sent. 
\v 27  For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every
sabbath day, they have fulfilled \add them\add* in condemning \add him\add*.
\v 28  And though they found no cause of death \add in him\add*,
yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. 
\v 29  And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
took \add him\add* down from the tree, and laid \add him\add* in
a sepulchre. 
\v 30  But God raised him from the dead: 
\v 31  And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. 
\v 32  And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
which was made unto the fathers, 
\v 33  God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised
up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art
my Son, this day have I begotten thee. 
\v 34  And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, \add now\add*
no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give
you the sure mercies of David. 
\v 35  Wherefore he saith also in another \add psalm\add*, Thou shalt
not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
\v 36  For David, after he had served his own generation by the will
of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
\v 37  But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. 
\p
\v 38 ¶ Be it known unto you therefore, men \add and\add* brethren,
that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
\v 39  And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
\v 40  Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken
of in the prophets; 
\v 41  Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a
work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though
a man declare it unto you. 
\v 42  And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
\v 43  Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews
and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking
to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. 
\p
\v 44 ¶ And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
to hear the word of God. 
\v 45  But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting
and blaspheming. 
\v 46  Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing
ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 
\v 47  For so hath the Lord commanded us, \add saying\add*, I have
set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
salvation unto the ends of the earth. 
\v 48  And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed. 
\v 49  And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
region. 
\v 50  But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. 
\v 51  But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
came unto Iconium. 
\v 52  And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy
Ghost. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together
into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude
both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. 
\v 2  But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
their minds evil affected against the brethren. 
\v 3  Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs
and wonders to be done by their hands. 
\v 4  But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with
the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
\v 5  And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and
also of the Jews with their rulers, to use \add them\add* despitefully,
and to stone them, 
\v 6  They were ware of \add it\add*, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe,
cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: 
\v 7  And there they preached the gospel. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked: 
\v 9  The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
\v 10  Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
leaped and walked. 
\v 11  And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come
down to us in the likeness of men. 
\v 12  And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
he was the chief speaker. 
\v 13  Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with
the people. 
\v 14  \add Which\add* when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard
\add of\add*, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,
crying out, 
\v 15  And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men
of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn
from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and all things that are therein: 
\v 16  Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
ways. 
\v 17  Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did
good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling
our hearts with food and gladness. 
\v 18  And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people,
that they had not done sacrifice unto them. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And there came thither \add certain\add* Jews from Antioch
and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew
\add him\add* out of the city, supposing he had been dead. 
\v 20  Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up,
and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas
to Derbe. 
\v 21  And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and \add to\add* Iconium,
and Antioch, 
\v 22  Confirming the souls of the disciples, \add and\add* exhorting
them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation
enter into the kingdom of God. 
\v 23  And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
believed. 
\v 24  And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
Pamphylia. 
\v 25  And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
into Attalia: 
\v 26  And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended
to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. 
\v 27  And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened
the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
\v 28  And there they abode long time with the disciples. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  And certain men which came down from Judæa taught the brethren,
\add and said\add*, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses, ye cannot be saved. 
\v 2  When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles
and elders about this question. 
\v 3  And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and
they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 
\v 4  And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
the church, and \add of\add* the apostles and elders, and they declared
all things that God had done with them. 
\v 5  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to
command \add them\add* to keep the law of Moses. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the apostles and elders came together for to consider
of this matter. 
\v 7  And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
said unto them, Men \add and\add* brethren, ye know how that a good
while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth
should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 
\v 8  And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
them the Holy Ghost, even as \add he did\add* unto us; 
\v 9  And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
hearts by faith. 
\v 10  Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck
of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11  But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
we shall be saved, even as they. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought
among the Gentiles by them. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,
Men \add and\add* brethren, hearken unto me: 
\v 14  Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles,
to take out of them a people for his name. 
\v 15  And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
\v 16  After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle
of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins
thereof, and I will set it up: 
\v 17  That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all
the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth
all these things. 
\v 18  Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
world. 
\v 19  Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which
from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 
\v 20  But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions
of idols, and \add from\add* fornication, and \add from\add* things
strangled, and \add from\add* blood. 
\v 21  For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach
him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. 
\v 22  Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church,
to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and
Barnabas; \add namely\add*, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief
men among the brethren: 
\v 23  And they wrote \add letters\add* by them after this manner;
The apostles and elders and brethren \add send\add* greeting unto the
brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
\v 24  Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from
us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, \add Ye
must\add* be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no \add such\add*
commandment: 
\v 25  It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
\v 26  Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ. 
\v 27  We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
\add you\add* the same things by mouth. 
\v 28  For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
you no greater burden than these necessary things; 
\v 29  That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye
keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. 
\v 30  So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had
gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 
\v 31  \add Which\add* when they had read, they rejoiced for the
consolation. 
\v 32  And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
the brethren with many words, and confirmed \add them\add*. 
\v 33  And after they had tarried \add there\add* a space, they were let
go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. 
\v 34  Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. 
\v 35  Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 
\p
\v 36 ¶ And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word
of the Lord, \add and see\add* how they do. 
\v 37  And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
was Mark. 
\v 38  But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
\v 39  And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed
unto Cyprus; 
\v 40  And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
brethren unto the grace of God. 
\v 41  And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple
was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a
Jewess, and believed; but his father \add was\add* a Greek: 
\v 2  Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra
and Iconium. 
\v 3  Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised
him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew
all that his father was a Greek. 
\v 4  And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders
which were at Jerusalem. 
\v 5  And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
in number daily. 
\v 6  Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word
in Asia, 
\v 7  After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia:
but the Spirit suffered them not. 
\v 8  And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. 
\v 9  And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and
help us. 
\v 10  And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called
us for to preach the gospel unto them. 
\v 11  Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
to Samothracia, and the next \add day\add* to Neapolis; 
\v 12  And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
part of Macedonia, \add and\add* a colony: and we were in that city
abiding certain days. 
\v 13  And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the
women which resorted \add thither.\add* 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard \add us\add*: whose
heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
spoken of Paul. 
\v 15  And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought
\add us\add*, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the
Lord, come into my house, and abide \add there\add*. And she constrained
us. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters
much gain by soothsaying: 
\v 17  The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men
are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way
of salvation. 
\v 18  And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned
and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ
to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was
gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew \add them\add* into the
marketplace unto the rulers, 
\v 20  And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being
Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 
\v 21  And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,
neither to observe, being Romans. 
\v 22  And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates
rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat \add them\add*. 
\v 23  And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast \add them\add*
into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 
\v 24  Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
God: and the prisoners heard them. 
\v 26  And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations
of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened,
and every one’s bands were loosed. 
\v 27  And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have
killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. 
\v 28  But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
for we are all here. 
\v 29  Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
and fell down before Paul and Silas, 
\v 30  And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
saved? 
\v 31  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved, and thy house. 
\v 32  And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
were in his house. 
\v 33  And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed \add their\add*
stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. 
\v 34  And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. 
\v 35  And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
Let those men go. 
\v 36  And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go
in peace. 
\v 37  But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
being Romans, and have cast \add us\add* into prison; and now do they
thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and
fetch us out. 
\v 38  And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. 
\v 39  And they came and besought them, and brought \add them\add*
out, and desired \add them\add* to depart out of the city. 
\v 40  And they went out of the prison, and entered into \add the house
of\add* Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted
them, and departed. 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 
\v 2  And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath
days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, 
\v 3  Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach
unto you, is Christ. 
\v 4  And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women
not a few. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company,
and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason,
and sought to bring them out to the people. 
\v 6  And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren
unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world
upside down are come hither also; 
\v 7  Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
decrees of Cæsar, saying that there is another king, \add one\add*
Jesus. 
\v 8  And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they
heard these things. 
\v 9  And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
they let them go. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by
night unto Berea: who coming \add thither\add* went into the synagogue
of the Jews. 
\v 11  These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
\v 12  Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. 
\v 13  But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and
stirred up the people. 
\v 14  And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. 
\v 15  And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him
with all speed, they departed. 
\p
\v 16 ¶ Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. 
\v 17  Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and
with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him. 
\v 18  Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other
some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. 
\v 19  And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying,
May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, \add is\add*?
\v 20  For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
know therefore what these things mean. 
\v 21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their
time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, \add Ye\add*
men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
\v 23  For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. 
\v 24  God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that
he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
hands; 
\v 25  Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed
any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
\v 26  And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell
on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 
\v 27  That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
\v 28  For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
\v 29  Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
graven by art and man’s device. 
\v 30  And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth
all men every where to repent: 
\v 31  Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
the world in righteousness by \add that\add* man whom he hath ordained;
\add whereof\add* he hath given assurance unto all \add men\add*,
in that he hath raised him from the dead. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this \add matter\add*.
\v 33  So Paul departed from among them. 
\v 34  Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
which \add was\add* Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,
and others with them. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
\v 2  And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius
had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
\v 3  And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 
\v 4  And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
the Jews and the Greeks. 
\v 5  And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews \add that\add*
Jesus \add was\add* Christ. 
\v 6  And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook
\add his\add* raiment, and said unto them, Your blood \add be\add*
upon your own heads; I \add am\add* clean: from henceforth I will
go unto the Gentiles. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain \add man’s\add*
house, named Justus, \add one\add* that worshipped God, whose house
joined hard to the synagogue. 
\v 8  And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed,
and were baptized. 
\v 9  Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, \wj 
Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:\wj* 
\v 10  \wj  For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt
thee: for I have much people in this city.\wj* 
\v 11  And he continued \add there\add* a year and six months, teaching
the word of God among them. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection
with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
\v 13  Saying, This \add fellow\add* persuadeth men to worship God
contrary to the law. 
\v 14  And when Paul was now about to open \add his\add* mouth, Gallio
said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness,
O \add ye\add* Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
\v 15  But if it be a question of words and names, and \add of\add*
your law, look ye \add to it\add*; for I will be no judge of such
\add matters\add*. 
\v 16  And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
\v 17  Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
synagogue, and beat \add him\add* before the judgment seat. And Gallio
cared for none of those things. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Paul \add after this\add* tarried \add there\add* yet
a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed
thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn
\add his\add* head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 
\v 19  And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
\v 20  When they desired \add him\add* to tarry longer time with
them, he consented not; 
\v 21  But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you,
if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. 
\v 22  And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted
the church, he went down to Antioch. 
\v 23  And after he had spent some time \add there\add*, he departed,
and went over \add all\add* the country of Galatia and Phrygia in
order, strengthening all the disciples. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
man, \add and\add* mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
\v 25  This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things
of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 
\v 26  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto \add them\add*, and expounded
unto him the way of God more perfectly. 
\v 27  And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come,
helped them much which had believed through grace: 
\v 28  For he mightily convinced the Jews, \add and that\add* publickly,
shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding
certain disciples, 
\v 2  He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Ghost. 
\v 3  And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And
they said, Unto John’s baptism. 
\v 4  Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance,
saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should
come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 
\v 5  When they heard \add this\add*, they were baptized in the name
of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 6  And when Paul had laid \add his\add* hands upon them, the Holy
Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
\v 7  And all the men were about twelve. 
\v 8  And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of God. 
\v 9  But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake
evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and
separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
\v 10  And this continued by the space of two years; so that all
they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews
and Greeks. 
\v 11  And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 
\v 12  So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits
went out of them. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus,
saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 
\v 14  And there were seven sons of \add one\add* Sceva, a Jew, \add and\add*
chief of the priests, which did so. 
\v 15  And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul
I know; but who are ye? 
\v 16  And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out
of that house naked and wounded. 
\v 17  And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling
at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus
was magnified. 
\v 18  And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
deeds. 
\v 19  Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
together, and burned them before all \add men\add*: and they counted
the price of them, and found \add it\add* fifty thousand \add pieces\add*
of silver. 
\v 20  So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,
saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. 
\v 22  So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto
him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
\v 23  And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
\v 24  For a certain \add man\add* named Demetrius, a silversmith,
which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the
craftsmen; 
\v 25  Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. 
\v 26  Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much
people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 
\v 27  So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should
be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia
and the world worshippeth. 
\v 28  And when they heard \add these sayings\add*, they were full
of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great \add is\add* Diana of the
Ephesians. 
\v 29  And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel,
they rushed with one accord into the theatre. 
\v 30  And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples
suffered him not. 
\v 31  And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends,
sent unto him, desiring \add him\add* that he would not adventure
himself into the theatre. 
\v 32  Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come
together. 
\v 33  And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have
made his defence unto the people. 
\v 34  But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the
space of two hours cried out, Great \add is\add* Diana of the Ephesians.
\v 35  And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, \add Ye\add*
men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city
of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and
of the \add image\add* which fell down from Jupiter? 
\v 36  Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. 
\v 37  For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of
churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. 
\v 38  Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies:
let them implead one another. 
\v 39  But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be
determined in a lawful assembly. 
\v 40  For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s
uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this
concourse. 
\v 41  And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto \add him\add*
the disciples, and embraced \add them\add*, and departed for to go
into Macedonia. 
\v 2  And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
exhortation, he came into Greece, 
\v 3  And \add there\add* abode three months. And when the Jews laid
wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to
return through Macedonia. 
\v 4  And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and
Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 
\v 5  These going before tarried for us at Troas. 
\v 6  And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven
days. 
\v 7  And upon the first \add day\add* of the week, when the disciples
came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on
the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. 
\v 8  And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
were gathered together. 
\v 9  And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk
down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken
up dead. 
\v 10  And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing \add him\add*
said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. 
\v 11  When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread,
and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
departed. 
\v 12  And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
comforted. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself
to go afoot. 
\v 14  And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came
to Mitylene. 
\v 15  And we sailed thence, and came the next \add day\add* over
against Chios; and the next \add day\add* we arrived at Samos, and
tarried at Trogyllium; and the next \add day\add* we came to Miletus.
\v 16  For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for
him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders
of the church. 
\v 18  And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have
been with you at all seasons, 
\v 19  Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many
tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the
Jews: 
\v 20  \add And\add* how I kept back nothing that was profitable
\add unto you\add*, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly,
and from house to house, 
\v 21  Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 22  And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,
not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 
\v 23  Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying
that bonds and afflictions abide me. 
\v 24  But none of these things move me, neither count I my life
dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify
the gospel of the grace of God. 
\v 25  And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 
\v 26  Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I \add am\add*
pure from the blood of all \add men\add*. 
\v 27  For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel
of God. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the
church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 
\v 29  For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 
\v 30  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
things, to draw away disciples after them. 
\v 31  Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 
\v 32  And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance
among all them which are sanctified. 
\v 33  I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel. 
\v 34  Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered
unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 
\v 35  I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring  ye ought
to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
how he said, \wj  It is more blessed to give than to receive.\wj*
\p
\v 36 ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed
with them all. 
\v 37  And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed
him, 
\v 38  Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
\c 21  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the \add day\add*
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 
\v 2  And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,
and set forth. 
\v 3  Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was
to unlade her burden. 
\v 4  And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
\v 5  And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children,
till \add we were\add* out of the city: and we kneeled down on the
shore, and prayed. 
\v 6  And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
and they returned home again. 
\v 7  And when we had finished \add our\add* course from Tyre, we
came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them
one day. 
\v 8  And the next \add day\add* we that were of Paul’s company departed,
and came unto Cæsarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the
evangelist, which was \add one\add* of the seven; and abode with
him. 
\v 9  And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
\v 10  And as we tarried \add there\add* many days, there came down
from Judæa a certain prophet, named Agabus. 
\v 11  And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound
his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall
the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall
deliver \add him\add* into the hands of the Gentiles. 
\v 12  And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
\v 13  Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem
for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 14  And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The
will of the Lord be done. 
\p
\v 15  And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up
to Jerusalem. 
\v 16  There went with us also \add certain\add* of the disciples
of Cæsarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple,
with whom we should lodge. 
\v 17  And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received
us gladly. 
\v 18  And the \add day\add* following Paul went in with us unto
James; and all the elders were present. 
\v 19  And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 
\v 20  And when they heard \add it\add*, they glorified the Lord,
and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews
there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: 
\v 21  And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the
Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they
ought not to circumcise \add their\add* children, neither to walk
after the customs. 
\v 22  What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
for they will hear that thou art come. 
\v 23  Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
have a vow on them; 
\v 24  Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges
with them, that they may shave \add their\add* heads: and all may
know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
are nothing; but \add that\add* thou thyself also walkest orderly,
and keepest the law. 
\v 25  As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written \add and\add*
concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep
themselves from \add things\add* offered to idols, and from blood,
and from strangled, and from fornication. 
\v 26  Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment
of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered
for every one of them. 
\p
\v 27  And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which
were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him, 
\v 28  Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth
all \add men\add* every where against the people, and the law, and
this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and
hath polluted this holy place. 
\v 29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
\v 30  And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the
doors were shut. 
\v 31  And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. 
\v 32  Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers,
they left beating of Paul. 
\v 33  Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
\add him\add* to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was,
and what he had done. 
\v 34  And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded
him to be carried into the castle. 
\v 35  And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of the people. 
\v 36  For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
with him. 
\v 37  And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief
captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
\v 38  Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were
murderers? 
\v 39  But Paul said, I am a man \add which am\add* a Jew of Tarsus,
\add a city\add* in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech
thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. 
\v 40  And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made
a great silence, he spake unto \add them\add* in the Hebrew tongue,
saying, 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1  Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence \add which I
make\add* now unto you. 
\v 2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,
they kept the more silence: and he saith,) 
\v 3  I am verily a man \add which am\add* a Jew, born in Tarsus,
\add a city\add* in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet
of Gamaliel, \add and\add* taught according to the perfect manner
of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all
are this day. 
\v 4  And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
into prisons both men and women. 
\v 5  As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the
elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and
went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem,
for to be punished. 
\v 6  And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a
great light round about me. 
\v 7  And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
\wj  Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\wj* 
\v 8  And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, \wj 
I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.\wj* 
\v 9  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. 
\v 10  And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
me, \wj  Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told
thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.\wj* 
\v 11  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the
hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. 
\v 12  And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good
report of all the Jews which dwelt \add there\add*, 
\v 13  Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy
sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. 
\v 14  And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest
know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice
of his mouth. 
\v 15  For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
seen and heard. 
\v 16  And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. 
\v 17  And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 
\v 18  And saw him saying unto me, \wj  Make haste, and get thee
quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony
concerning me.\wj* 
\v 19  And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
every synagogue them that believed on thee: 
\v 20  And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also
was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment
of them that slew him. 
\v 21  And he said unto me, \wj  Depart: for I will send thee far
hence unto the Gentiles.\wj* 
\v 22  And they gave him audience unto this word, and \add then\add*
lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a \add fellow\add*
from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. 
\v 23  And as they cried out, and cast off \add their\add* clothes,
and threw dust into the air, 
\v 24  The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle,
and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know
wherefore they cried so against him. 
\v 25  And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,
and uncondemned? 
\v 26  When the centurion heard \add that\add*, he went and told
the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man
is a Roman. 
\v 27  Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
thou a Roman? He said, Yea. 
\v 28  And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained
I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was \add free\add* born. 
\v 29  Then straightway they departed from him which should have
examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew
that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
\v 30  On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore
he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from \add his\add* bands,
and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear,
and brought Paul down, and set him before them. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1  And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men \add and\add*
brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this
day. 
\v 2  And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him
to smite him on the mouth. 
\v 3  Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, \add thou\add*
whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest
me to be smitten contrary to the law? 
\v 4  And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
\v 5  Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler
of thy people. 
\v 6  But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and
the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men \add and\add*
brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and
resurrection of the dead I am called in question. 
\v 7  And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided. 
\v 8  For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both. 
\v 9  And there arose a great cry: and the scribes \add that were\add*
of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil
in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let
us not fight against God. 
\v 10  And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded
the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them,
and to bring \add him\add* into the castle. 
\v 11  And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, \wj 
Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem,
so must thou bear witness also at Rome.\wj* 
\v 12  And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together,
and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither
eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 
\v 13  And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
\v 14  And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until
we have slain Paul. 
\v 15  Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire
something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come
near, are ready to kill him. 
\v 16  And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait,
he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. 
\v 17  Then Paul called one of the centurions unto \add him\add*,
and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath
a certain thing to tell him. 
\v 18  So he took him, and brought \add him\add* to the chief captain,
and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto \add him\add*, and prayed
me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto
thee. 
\v 19  Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went \add with
him\add* aside privately, and asked \add him\add*, What is that thou
hast to tell me? 
\v 20  And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring
down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire
somewhat of him more perfectly. 
\v 21  But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for
him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an
oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed
him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee. 
\v 22  So the chief captain \add then\add* let the young man depart,
and charged \add him, See thou\add* tell no man that thou hast shewed
these things to me. 
\v 23  And he called unto \add him\add* two centurions, saying, Make
ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cæsarea, and horsemen threescore and
ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; 
\v 24  And provide \add them\add* beasts, that they may set Paul
on, and bring \add him\add* safe unto Felix the governor. 
\v 25  And he wrote a letter after this manner: 
\v 26  Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix \add sendeth\add*
greeting. 
\v 27  This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed
of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood
that he was a Roman. 
\v 28  And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
him, I brought him forth into their council: 
\v 29  Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law,
but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
\v 30  And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the
man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers
also to say before thee what \add they had\add* against him. Farewell.
\v 31  Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
brought \add him\add* by night to Antipatris. 
\v 32  On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned
to the castle: 
\v 33  Who, when they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle
to the governor, presented Paul also before him. 
\v 34  And when the governor had read \add the letter\add*, he asked
of what province he was. And when he understood that \add he was\add*
of Cilicia; 
\v 35  I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.
And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1  And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with
the elders, and \add with\add* a certain orator \add named\add* Tertullus,
who informed the governor against Paul. 
\v 2  And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse \add him\add*,
saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy
deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 
\v 3  We accept \add it\add* always, and in all places, most noble
Felix, with all thankfulness. 
\v 4  Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
\v 5  For we have found this man \add a\add* pestilent \add fellow\add*,
and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world,
and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
\v 6  Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
and would have judged according to our law. 
\v 7  But the chief captain Lysias came \add upon us\add*, and with
great violence took \add him\add* away out of our hands, 
\v 8  Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of
whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we
accuse him. 
\v 9  And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
\v 10  Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many
years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for
myself: 
\v 11  Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. 
\v 12  And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any
man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor
in the city: 
\v 13  Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse
me. 
\v 14  But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things
which are written in the law and in the prophets: 
\v 15  And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just
and unjust. 
\v 16  And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
void of offence toward God, and \add toward\add* men. 
\v 17  Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
offerings. 
\v 18  Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
\v 19  Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
had ought against me. 
\v 20  Or else let these same \add here\add* say, if they have found
any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, 
\v 21  Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question
by you this day. 
\p
\v 22  And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge
of \add that\add* way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief
captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
\v 23  And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let \add him\add*
have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance
to minister or come unto him. 
\p
\v 24  And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the
faith in Christ. 
\v 25  And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time;
when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
\v 26  He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and
communed with him. 
\v 27  But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room:
and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
\c 25  
\p
\v 1  Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days
he ascended from Cæsarea to Jerusalem. 
\v 2  Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
against Paul, and besought him, 
\v 3  And desired favour against him, that he would send for him
to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. 
\v 4  But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Cæsarea, and
that he himself would depart shortly \add thither\add*. 
\v 5  Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
with \add me\add*, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness
in him. 
\v 6  And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
down unto Cæsarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded Paul to be brought. 
\v 7  And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against
Paul, which they could not prove. 
\v 8  While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Cæsar, have I offended
any thing at all. 
\v 9  But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul,
and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these
things before me? 
\v 10  Then said Paul, I stand at Cæsar’s judgment seat, where I
ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very
well knowest. 
\v 11  For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy
of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things
whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal
unto Cæsar. 
\v 12  Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
Hast thou appealed unto Cæsar? unto Cæsar shalt thou go. 
\p
\v 13  And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
Cæsarea to salute Festus. 
\v 14  And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s
cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds
by Felix: 
\v 15  About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and
the elders of the Jews informed \add me\add*, desiring \add to have\add*
judgment against him. 
\v 16  To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the
accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning
the crime laid against him. 
\v 17  Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the
morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought
forth. 
\v 18  Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
accusation of such things as I supposed: 
\v 19  But had certain questions against him of their own superstition,
and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
\v 20  And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked
\add him\add* whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged
of these matters. 
\v 21  But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing
of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to
Cæsar. 
\v 22  Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. 
\p
\v 23  And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief
captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul
was brought forth. 
\v 24  And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the
Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and \add also\add* here,
crying that he ought not to live any longer. 
\v 25  But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined
to send him. 
\v 26  Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore
I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O
king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat
to write. 
\v 27  For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and
not withal to signify the crimes \add laid\add* against him. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1  Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
\v 2  I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am
accused of the Jews: 
\v 3  Especially \add because I know\add* thee to be expert in all
customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech
thee to hear me patiently. 
\v 4  My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
\v 5  Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
\v 6  And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
of God unto our fathers: 
\v 7  Unto which \add promise\add* our twelve tribes, instantly serving
\add God\add* day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake,
king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. 
\v 8  Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that
God should raise the dead? 
\v 9  I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
\v 10  Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
\add them\add*. 
\v 11  And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled
\add them\add* to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them,
I persecuted \add them\add* even unto strange cities. 
\v 12  Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
from the chief priests, 
\v 13  At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which
journeyed with me. 
\v 14  And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, \wj  Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? \+add it is\+add* hard for thee to kick
against the pricks.\wj* 
\v 15  And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, \wj  I am Jesus
whom thou persecutest.\wj* 
\v 16  \wj  But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared
unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the
which I will appear unto thee;\wj* 
\v 17  \wj  Delivering thee from the people, and \+add from\+add*
the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,\wj* 
\v 18  \wj  To open their eyes, \+add  and\+add* to turn \+add them\+add*
from darkness to light, and \+add from\+add* the power of Satan unto
God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among
them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.\wj* 
\v 19  Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision: 
\v 20  But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem,
and throughout all the coasts of Judæa, and \add then\add* to the
Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet
for repentance. 
\v 21  For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill \add me\add*. 
\v 22  Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things
than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
\v 23  That Christ should suffer, \add and\add* that he should be the
first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the
people, and to the Gentiles. 
\p
\v 24  And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee
mad. 
\v 25  But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness. 
\v 26  For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
\v 27  King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest. 
\v 28  Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to
be a Christian. 
\v 29  And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also
all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such
as I am, except these bonds. 
\v 30  And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
\v 31  And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
\v 32  Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cæsar. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1  And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto \add one\add*
named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band. 
\v 2  And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
to sail by the coasts of Asia; \add one\add* Aristarchus, a Macedonian
of Thessalonica, being with us. 
\v 3  And the next \add day\add* we touched at Sidon. And Julius
courteously entreated Paul, and gave \add him\add* liberty to go
unto his friends to refresh himself. 
\v 4  And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
because the winds were contrary. 
\v 5  And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
we came to Myra, \add a city\add* of Lycia. 
\v 6  And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
into Italy; and he put us therein. 
\v 7  And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete,
over against Salmone; 
\v 8  And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city \add of\add* Lasea. 
\p
\v 9  Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished \add them\add*,
\v 10  And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will
be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but
also of our lives. 
\v 11  Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the
ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. 
\v 12  And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain
to Phenice, \add and there\add* to winter; \add which is\add* an
haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. 
\v 13  And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
obtained \add their\add* purpose, loosing \add thence\add*, they
sailed close by Crete. 
\v 14  But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
called Euroclydon. 
\v 15  And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
wind, we let \add her\add* drive. 
\v 16  And running under a certain island which is called Clauda,
we had much work to come by the boat: 
\v 17  Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands,
strake sail, and so were driven. 
\v 18  And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next \add day\add*
they lightened the ship; 
\v 19  And the third \add day\add* we cast out with our own hands
the tackling of the ship. 
\v 20  And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and
no small tempest lay on \add us\add*, all hope that we should be
saved was then taken away. 
\v 21  But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have
loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss. 
\v 22  And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall
be no loss of \add any man’s\add* life among you, but of the ship.
\v 23  For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I
am, and whom I serve, 
\v 24  Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar:
and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. 
\v 25  Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that
it shall be even as it was told me. 
\v 26  Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. 
\v 27  But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near
to some country; 
\v 28  And sounded, and found \add it\add* twenty fathoms: and when they had
gone a little further, they sounded again, and found \add it\add*
fifteen fathoms. 
\v 29  Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. 
\v 30  And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they
would have cast anchors out of the foreship, 
\v 31  Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. 
\v 32  Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
fall off. 
\v 33  And while the day was coming on, Paul besought \add them\add*
all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. 
\v 34  Wherefore I pray you to take \add some\add* meat: for this
is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head
of any of you. 
\v 35  And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks
to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken \add it\add*,
he began to eat. 
\v 36  Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took \add some\add*
meat. 
\v 37  And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
sixteen souls. 
\v 38  And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast
out the wheat into the sea. 
\v 39  And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if
it were possible, to thrust in the ship. 
\v 40  And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed \add themselves\add*
unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail
to the wind, and made toward shore. 
\v 41  And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the
ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable,
but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. 
\v 42  And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest
any of them should swim out, and escape. 
\v 43  But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from \add their\add*
purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast \add themselves\add*
first \add into the sea\add*, and get to land: 
\v 44  And the rest, some on boards, and some on \add broken pieces\add*
of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
land. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1  And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island
was called Melita. 
\v 2  And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for
they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present
rain, and because of the cold. 
\v 3  And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid \add them\add*
on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on
his hand. 
\v 4  And when the barbarians saw the \add venomous\add* beast hang
on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer,
whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not
to live. 
\v 5  And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
\v 6  Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen
down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and
saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that
he was a god. 
\p
\v 7  In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three
days courteously. 
\v 8  And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed,
and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
\v 9  So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
island, came, and were healed: 
\v 10  Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
they laded \add us\add* with such things as were necessary. 
\p
\v 11  And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
\v 12  And landing at Syracuse, we tarried \add there\add* three
days. 
\v 13  And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium:
and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
Puteoli: 
\v 14  Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
\v 15  And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came
to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when
Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 
\v 16  And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself
with a soldier that kept him. 
\p
\v 17  And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he
said unto them, Men \add and\add* brethren, though I have committed
nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I
delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
\v 18  Who, when they had examined me, would have let \add me\add*
go, because there was no cause of death in me. 
\v 19  But when the Jews spake against \add it\add*, I was constrained
to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
\v 20  For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see \add you\add*,
and to speak with \add you\add*: because that for the hope of Israel
I am bound with this chain. 
\v 21  And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
Judæa concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed
or spake any harm of thee. 
\v 22  But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning
 this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. 
\v 23  And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to
him into \add his\add* lodging; to whom he expounded and testified
the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the
law of Moses, and \add out of\add* the prophets, from morning till
evening. 
\v 24  And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed
not. 
\v 25  And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by
Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, 
\v 26  Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
\v 27  For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should
see with \add their\add* eyes, and hear with \add their\add* ears,
and understand with \add their\add* heart, and should be converted,
and I should heal them. 
\v 28  Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God
is sent unto the Gentiles, and \add that\add* they will hear it.
\v 29  And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
great reasoning among themselves. 
\p
\v 30  And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
received all that came in unto him, 
\v 31  Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding
him.
