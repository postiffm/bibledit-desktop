\v 1  Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode
two days in Ziklag; 
\v 2  It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his
head: and \add so\add* it was, when he came to David, that he fell
to the earth, and did obeisance. 
\v 3  And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 
\v 4  And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle,
and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan
his son are dead also.\f + \fr 1.4  \ft How…: Heb. What was, etc\f*
\v 5  And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? 
\v 6  And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the
chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 
\v 7  And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I
answered, Here \add am\add* I.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft Here…: Heb. Behold
me\f* 
\v 8  And he said unto me, Who \add art\add* thou? And I answered him, I
\add am\add* an Amalekite. 
\v 9  He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life \add is\add* yet whole in
me.\f + \fr 1.9  \ft anguish…: or, my coat of mail (or, my embroidered coat) hindereth me, that my,
etc\f* 
\v 10  So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not
live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that \add was\add*
upon his head, and the bracelet that \add was\add* on his arm, and have
brought them hither unto my lord. 
\p
\v 11  Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the
men that \add were\add* with him: 
\v 12  And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the \nd LORD\nd*,
and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence \add art\add*
thou? And he answered, I \add am\add* the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
\v 14  And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
forth thine hand to destroy the \nd LORD’s\nd* anointed? 
\v 15  And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
\add and\add* fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. 
\v 16  And David said unto him, Thy blood \add be\add* upon thy head;
for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
\nd LORD’s\nd* anointed. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
Jonathan his son: 
\v 18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah \add the use
of\add* the bow: behold, \add it is\add* written in the book of Jasher.)\f + \fr 1.18 
\ft of Jasher: or, of the upright\f* 
\v 19  The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
mighty fallen! 
\v 20  Tell \add it\add* not in Gath, publish \add it\add* not in the
streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 
\v 21  Ye mountains of Gilboa, \add let there be\add* no dew, neither
\add let there be\add* rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, \add as though he
had\add* not \add been\add* anointed with oil. 
\v 22  From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not
empty. 
\v 23  Saul and Jonathan \add were\add* lovely and pleasant in their
lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter
than eagles, they were stronger than lions.\f + \fr 1.23  \ft pleasant: or,
sweet\f* 
\v 24  Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
scarlet, with \add other\add* delights, who put on ornaments of gold
upon your apparel. 
\v 25  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
\add thou wast\add* slain in thine high places. 
\v 26  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the
love of women. 
\v 27  How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
\nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
And the \nd LORD\nd* said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go
up? And he said, Unto Hebron. 
\v 2  So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite. 
\v 3  And his men that \add were\add* with him did David bring up,
every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\v 4  And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, \add That\add*
the men of Jabesh-gilead \add were they\add* that buried Saul. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and
said unto them, Blessed \add be\add* ye of the \nd LORD\nd*, that ye have
shewed this kindness unto your lord, \add even\add* unto Saul, and have
buried him. 
\v 6  And now the \nd LORD\nd* shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 
\v 7  Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:
for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed
me king over them.\f + \fr 2.7  \ft be ye…: Heb. be ye the sons of
valour\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ish-bosheth
the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;\f + \fr 2.8  \ft Saul’s host: Heb. the host which was
Saul’s\f*\f + \fr 2.8  \ft Ish-bosheth: or, Esh-baal\f* 
\v 9  And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over
Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\v 10  Ish-bosheth Saul’s son \add was\add* forty years old when he began to
reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah
followed David. 
\v 11  And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house
of Judah was seven years and six months.\f + \fr 2.11  \ft time: Heb. number of
days\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth
the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
\v 13  And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the
pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.\f + \fr 2.13 
\ft together: Heb. them together\f* 
\v 14  And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 
\v 15  Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which
\add pertained\add* to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the
servants of David. 
\v 16  And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and \add thrust\add*
his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that
place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which \add is\add* in Gibeon.\f + \fr 2.16 
\ft Helkath-hazzurim: that is, The field of strong men\f* 
\v 17  And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
and Asahel: and Asahel \add was as\add* light of foot as a wild roe.\f + \fr 2.18 
\ft of foot: Heb. of his feet\f*\f + \fr 2.18  \ft as a wild…: Heb. as one of the roes that is in the
field\f* 
\v 19  And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right
hand nor to the left from following Abner.\f + \fr 2.19  \ft from…: Heb. from after
Abner\f* 
\v 20  Then Abner looked behind him, and said, \add Art\add* thou
Asahel? And he answered, I \add am\add*. 
\v 21  And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy
left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his
armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.\f + \fr 2.21 
\ft armour: or, spoil\f* 
\v 22  And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold
up my face to Joab thy brother? 
\v 23  Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder
end of the spear smote him under the fifth \add rib\add*, that the
spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same
place: and it came to pass, \add that\add* as many as came to the
place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. 
\v 24  Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that \add lieth\add*
before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
\v 26  Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter
end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from
following their brethren? 
\v 27  And Joab said, \add As\add* God liveth, unless thou hadst
spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one
from following his brother.\f + \fr 2.27  \ft in the…: Heb. from the
morning\f*\f + \fr 2.27  \ft gone…: or, gone away\f* 
\v 28  So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. 
\v 29  And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came
to Mahanaim. 
\v 30  And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered
all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen
men and Asahel. 
\v 31  But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
Abner’s men, \add so that\add* three hundred and threescore men died.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre
of his father, which \add was in\add* Beth-lehem. And Joab and his
men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of
Saul waxed weaker and weaker. 
\p
\v 2 ¶ And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn
was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 
\v 3  And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king
of Geshur;\f + \fr 3.3  \ft Chileab: or, Daniel\f* 
\v 4  And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
\v 5  And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born
to David in Hebron. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And it came to pass, while there was war between the house
of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the
house of Saul. 
\p
\v 7  And Saul had a concubine, whose name \add was\add* Rizpah,
the daughter of Aiah: and \add Ish-bosheth\add* said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone
in unto my father’s concubine? 
\v 8  Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and
said, \add Am\add* I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness
this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his
friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou
chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? 
\v 9  So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the \nd LORD\nd*
hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 
\v 10  To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set
up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to
Beer-sheba. 
\v 11  And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose
\add is\add* the land? saying \add also\add*, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my
hand \add shall be\add* with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou
first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.\f + \fr 3.13 
\ft that is: Heb. saying\f* 
\v 14  And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying,
Deliver \add me\add* my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
hundred foreskins of the Philistines. 
\v 15  And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from \add her\add* husband,
\add even\add* from Phaltiel the son of Laish.\f + \fr 3.15  \ft Phaltiel: also called,
Phalti\f* 
\v 16  And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.\f + \fr 3.16 
\ft along…: Heb. going and weeping\f* 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
Ye sought for David in times past \add to be\add* king over you:\f + \fr 3.17 
\ft in times…: Heb. both yesterday and the third day\f* 
\v 18  Now then do \add it:\add* for the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken
of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my
people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the
hand of all their enemies. 
\v 19  And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good
to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. 
\v 20  So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
David made Abner and the men that \add were\add* with him a feast.
\v 21  And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather
all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest
reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away;
and he went in peace. 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from \add pursuing\add*
a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner \add was\add*
not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone
in peace. 
\v 23  When Joab and all the host that \add was\add* with him were
come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king,
and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 
\v 24  Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
behold, Abner came unto thee; why \add is\add* it \add that\add*
thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? 
\v 25  Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou
doest. 
\v 26  And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but
David knew \add it\add* not. 
\v 27  And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside
in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the
fifth \add rib\add*, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.\f + \fr 3.27 
\ft quietly: or, peaceably\f* 
\p
\v 28 ¶ And afterward when David heard \add it\add*, he said, I and my
kingdom \add are\add* guiltless before the \nd LORD\nd* for ever
from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:\f + \fr 3.28  \ft blood: Heb.
bloods\f* 
\v 29  Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house;
and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue,
or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the
sword, or that lacketh bread.\f + \fr 3.29  \ft fail: Heb. be cut
off\f* 
\v 30  So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And David said to Joab, and to all the people that \add were\add*
with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
before Abner. And king David \add himself\add* followed the bier.\f + \fr 3.31 
\ft bier: Heb. bed\f* 
\v 32  And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 
\v 33  And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
fool dieth? 
\v 34  Thy hands \add were\add* not bound, nor thy feet put into
fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, \add so\add* fellest
thou. And all the people wept again over him.\f + \fr 3.34  \ft wicked…: Heb. children of
iniquity\f* 
\v 35  And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was
yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I
taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down. 
\v 36  And all the people took notice \add of it\add*, and it pleased
them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.\f + \fr 3.36 
\ft pleased them: Heb. was good in their eyes\f* 
\v 37  For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the
king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
\v 38  And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 
\v 39 And I \add am\add* this day weak, though anointed king; and these
men the sons of Zeruiah \add be\add* too hard for me: the \nd LORD\nd*
shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.\f + \fr 3.39 
\ft weak: Heb. tender\f* 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 
\v 2  And Saul’s son had two men \add that were\add* captains of
bands: the name of the one \add was\add* Baanah, and the name of the
other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of
Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:\f + \fr 4.2 
\ft other: Heb. second\f* 
\v 3  And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this
day.) 
\v 4  And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son \add that was\add* lame of
\add his\add* feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of
Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and
fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
and became lame. And his name \add was\add* Mephibosheth.\f + \fr 4.4 
\ft Mephibosheth: or, Merib-baal\f* 
\v 5  And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who
lay on a bed at noon. 
\v 6  And they came thither into the midst of the house, \add as
though\add* they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
fifth \add rib:\add* and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
\v 7  For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and
took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. 
\v 8  And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron,
and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul
thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the \nd LORD\nd* hath avenged
my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons
of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 
\v 10  When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who
\add thought\add* that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:\f + \fr 4.10 
\ft thinking…: Heb. he was in his own eyes as a bringer, etc\f*\f + \fr 4.10 
\ft who…: or, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings\f*
\v 11  How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require
his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
\v 12  And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
off their hands and their feet, and hanged \add them\add* up over the
pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried
\add it\add* in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
spake, saying, Behold, we \add are\add* thy bone and thy flesh. 
\v 2  Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest
out and broughtest in Israel: and the \nd LORD\nd* said to thee, Thou shalt
feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. 
\v 3  So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
king David made a league with them in Hebron before the \nd LORD\nd*:
and they anointed David king over Israel. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ David \add was\add* thirty years old when he began to reign,
\add and\add* he reigned forty years. 
\v 5  In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel
and Judah. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take
away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking,
David cannot come in hither.\f + \fr 5.6  \ft thinking…: or, saying David shall not,
etc\f* 
\v 7  Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same \add is\add*
the city of David. 
\v 8  And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, \add that
are\add* hated of David’s soul, \add he shall be chief and captain\add*.
Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the
house.\f + \fr 5.8  \ft Wherefore…: or, Because they had said, even the blind and the lame, He shall
not\f* 
\v 9  So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
And David built round about from Millo and inward. 
\v 10  And David went on, and grew great, and the \nd LORD\nd* God
of hosts \add was\add* with him.\f + \fr 5.10  \ft went…: Heb. went, going and
growing\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.\f + \fr 5.11 
\ft masons: Heb. hewers of the stone of the wall\f* 
\v 12  And David perceived that the \nd LORD\nd* had established
him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
people Israel’s sake. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And David took \add him\add* more concubines and wives out of
Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons
and daughters born to David. 
\v 14 And these \add be\add* the names of those that were born unto him in
Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 
\v 15  Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
\v 16  And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and
David heard \add of it\add*, and went down to the hold. 
\v 18  The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
of Rephaim. 
\v 19  And David enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I go
up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
\nd LORD\nd* said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver
the Philistines into thine hand. 
\v 20  And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and
said, The \nd LORD\nd* hath broken forth upon mine enemies before
me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
place Baal-perazim.\f + \fr 5.20  \ft Baal-perazim: that is, the plain of
breaches\f* 
\v 21  And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
them.\f + \fr 5.21  \ft burned…: or, took them away\f* 
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the
valley of Rephaim. 
\v 23  And when David enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, he said, Thou shalt not go

\v 24  And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the
\nd LORD\nd* go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
\v 25  And David did so, as the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded him; and
smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.\f + \fr 5.25

\p
\v 1  Again, David gathered together all \add the\add* chosen \add men\add*
of Israel, thirty thousand. 
\v 2  And David arose, and went with all the people that \add were\add*
with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
God, whose name is called by the name of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts
that dwelleth \add between\add* the cherubims.\f + \fr 6.2  \ft Baale: or, Baalah, that is,

\v 3  And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the

the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.\f + \fr 6.3  \ft set: Heb. made to

\v 5  And David and all the house of Israel played before the \nd LORD\nd* on all manner of
\add instruments made of\add* fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries,
and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
\add his hand\add* to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the
oxen shook \add it\add*.\f + \fr 6.6  \ft Nachon: also called Chidon\f*\f + \fr 6.6 
\ft shook it: or, stumbled\f* 
\v 7  And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Uzzah;
and God smote him there for \add his\add* error; and there he died
by the ark of God.\f + \fr 6.7  \ft error: or, rashness\f* 
\v 8  And David was displeased, because the \nd LORD\nd* had made
a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah
to this day.\f + \fr 6.8  \ft made: Heb. broken\f*\f + \fr 6.8  \ft Perez-uzzah: that is, the breach of
Uzzah\f* 
\v 9  And David was afraid of the \nd LORD\nd* that day, and said,
How shall the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* come to me? 
\v 10  So David would not remove the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* unto him into the
city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom
the Gittite. 
\v 11  And the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* continued in the house of
Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the \nd LORD\nd* blessed
Obed-edom, and all his household. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And it was told king David, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* hath
blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that \add pertaineth\add*
unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up
the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David
with gladness. 
\v 13 And it was \add so\add*, that when they that bare the ark of the
\nd LORD\nd* had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
\v 14  And David danced before the \nd LORD\nd* with all \add his\add*
might; and David \add was\add* girded with a linen ephod. 
\v 15  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
\nd LORD\nd* with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 
\v 16  And as the ark of the \nd LORD\nd* came into the city of David,
Michal Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
leaping and dancing before the \nd LORD\nd*; and she despised him in her
heart. 
\p
\v 17 ¶ And they brought in the ark of the \nd LORD\nd*, and set
it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before
the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 6.17  \ft pitched: Heb. stretched\f* 
\v 18  And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*
of hosts. 
\v 19  And he dealt among all the people, \add even\add* among the whole
multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a
cake of bread, and a good piece \add of flesh\add*, and a flagon
\add of wine\add*. So all the people departed every one to his house.
\p
\v 20 ¶ Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the
king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the
handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly
uncovereth himself!\f + \fr 6.20  \ft shamelessly: or, openly\f*
\v 21  And David said unto Michal, \add It was\add* before the \nd LORD\nd*,
which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint
me ruler over the people of the \nd LORD\nd*, over Israel: therefore will I
play before the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 22  And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own

\v 23  Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
day of her death. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
\nd LORD\nd* had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
\v 2  That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
\v 3  And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that \add is\add* in thine
heart; for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* with thee. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
came unto Nathan, saying, 
\v 5  Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*,
Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?\f + \fr 7.5  \ft my servant…: Heb. to my servant, to
David\f* 
\v 6  Whereas I have not dwelt in \add any\add* house since the time
that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
\v 7 In all \add the places\add* wherein I have walked with all the
children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an
house of cedar?\f + \fr 7.7  \ft any of…: any of the judges\f* 
\v 8  Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus

from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:\f + \fr 7.8 
\ft from following: Heb. from after\f* 
\v 9  And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great
name, like unto the name of the great \add men\add* that \add are\add*
in the earth.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft out of…: Heb. from thy face\f* 
\v 10  Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move
no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any
more, as beforetime, 
\v 11  And as since the time that I commanded judges \add to be\add*
over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
enemies. Also the \nd LORD\nd* telleth thee that he will make thee an
house. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 13  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever. 
\v 14  I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
of the children of men: 
\v 15  But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took \add it\add*
from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 
\v 16  And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 
\v 17  According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
so did Nathan speak unto David. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then went king David in, and sat before the \nd LORD\nd*,
and he said, Who \add am\add* I, O Lord \nd GOD\nd*? and what \add is\add*
my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
\v 19  And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord \nd GOD\nd*;
but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to

\v 20  And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord \nd GOD\nd*,
knowest thy servant. 
\v 21  For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
done all these great things, to make thy servant know \add them\add*.
\v 22  Wherefore thou art great, O \nd LORD\nd* God: for \add there
is\add* none like thee, neither \add is there any\add* God beside

\v 23  And what one nation in the earth \add is\add* like thy people,
\add even\add* like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people
to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things
and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst
to thee from Egypt, \add from\add* the nations and their gods? 
\v 24  For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel \add to

\v 25  And now, O \nd LORD\nd* God, the word that thou hast spoken

\v 26  And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The \nd LORD\nd*

\v 27  For thou, O \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed

\v 28  And now, O Lord \nd GOD\nd*, thou \add art\add* that God,

\v 1  And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,
and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the
Philistines.\f + \fr 8.1  \ft Metheg-ammah: or, the bridle of Ammah\f*
\v 2  And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death,
and with one full line to keep alive. And \add so\add* the Moabites
became David’s servants, \add and\add* brought gifts. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.\f + \fr 8.3 
\ft Hadadezer: or, Hadarezer\f* 
\v 4  And David took from him a thousand \add chariots\add*, and

\v 5  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand

\v 6  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
became servants to David, \add and\add* brought gifts. And the \nd LORD\nd*
preserved David whithersoever he went. 
\v 7  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8  And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
David took exceeding much brass. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
host of Hadadezer, 
\v 10  Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to
bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for
Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And \add Joram\add* brought with him

\v 15  And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment

\v 3  And the king said, \add Is\add* there not yet any of the house

unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, \add which is\add* lame on

\v 4  And the king said unto him, Where \add is\add* he? And Ziba
said unto the king, Behold, he \add is\add* in the house of Machir,

\v 5 ¶ Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 
\v 6  Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,

\v 8  And he bowed himself, and said, What \add is\add* thy servant,
that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I \add am\add*?
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have

\v 10  Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till
the land for him, and thou shalt bring in \add the fruits\add*, that thy

son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons
and twenty servants. 
\v 11  Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for
Mephibosheth, \add said the king\add*, he shall eat at my table,
as one of the king’s sons. 
\v 12  And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name \add was\add*

\v 13  So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually

\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2  Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to
comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s
servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 
\v 3  And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
sent comforters unto thee? hath not David \add rather\add* sent his

\v 5  When they told \add it\add* unto David, he sent to meet them, because the

\p
\v 6 ¶ And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob,
and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah

at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob,
and Ish-tob, and Maacah, \add were\add* by themselves in the field.
\v 9  When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him

\v 10  And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai

\v 11  And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt

come and help thee. 
\v 12  Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
and for the cities of our God: and the \nd LORD\nd* do that which

\v 13  And Joab drew nigh, and the people that \add were\add* with him, unto the
battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. 
\v 14  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So
Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
they gathered themselves together. 
\v 16  And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that \add were\add*

\c 11  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
when kings go forth \add to battle\add*, that David sent Joab, and his

he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman \add was\add* very

\v 11  And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,

\v 12  And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the

\v 13  And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before

\p
\v 14 ¶ And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter

\v 21  Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died
in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant
Uriah the Hittite is dead also.\f + \fr 11.21  \ft Jerubbesheth: also called,

\p
\v 22 ¶ So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that
Joab had sent him for. 
\v 23  And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the
entering of the gate. 
\v 24  And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
\add some\add* of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah
the Hittite is dead also. 
\v 25  Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth
one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city,
and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.\f + \fr 11.25  \ft displease…: Heb. be evil in thine
eyes\f*\f + \fr 11.25  \ft one…: Heb. so and such\f* 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
dead, she mourned for her husband. 
\v 27  And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his
house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing
that David had done displeased the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 11.27  \ft displeased: Heb. was evil in the eyes
of\f* 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1  And the \nd LORD\nd* sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the
other poor. 
\v 2  The rich \add man\add* had exceeding many flocks and herds:
\v 3  But the poor \add man\add* had nothing, save one little ewe
lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together
with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a
daughter.\f + \fr 12.3  \ft meat: Heb. morsel\f* 
\v 4  And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared
to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed
it for the man that was come to him. 
\v 5  And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
said to Nathan, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, the man that hath
done this \add thing\add* shall surely die:\f + \fr 12.5  \ft shall…: or, is worthy to die, or, is a son of
death\f* 
\v 6  And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
thing, and because he had no pity. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ And Nathan said to David, Thou \add art\add* the man. Thus
saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel,
and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 
\v 8  And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives
into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if
\add that had been\add* too little, I would moreover have given unto thee
such and such things. 
\v 9  Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the \nd LORD\nd*,
to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the
sword, and hast taken his wife \add to be\add* thy wife, and hast
slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
\v 10  Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the
Hittite to be thy wife. 
\v 11  Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will raise up evil
against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
eyes, and give \add them\add* unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie
with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 
\v 12  For thou didst \add it\add* secretly: but I will do this thing
before all Israel, and before the sun. 
\v 13  And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*.
And Nathan said unto David, The \nd LORD\nd* also hath put away thy
sin; thou shalt not die. 
\v 14  Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
to the enemies of the \nd LORD\nd* to blaspheme, the child also \add that
is\add* born unto thee shall surely die. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Nathan departed unto his house. And the \nd LORD\nd*
struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very
sick. 
\v 16  David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.\f + \fr 12.16  \ft fasted: Heb. fasted a
fast\f* 
\v 17  And the elders of his house arose, \add and went\add* to him, to raise him
up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\v 18  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead:
for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not
hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell
him that the child is dead?\f + \fr 12.18  \ft vex: Heb. do hurt\f*
\v 19  But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived
that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants,
Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 
\v 20  Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
\add himself\add*, and changed his apparel, and came into the house
of the \nd LORD\nd*, and worshipped: then he came to his own house;
and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
\v 21  Then said his servants unto him, What thing \add is\add* this that thou hast
done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, \add while it was\add*
alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
\v 22  And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
for I said, Who can tell \add whether\add* \nd GOD\nd* will be gracious
to me, that the child may live? 
\v 23  But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back
again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and
lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon:
and the \nd LORD\nd* loved him. 
\v 25  And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
his name Jedidiah, because of the \nd LORD\nd*.\f + \fr 12.25  \ft Jedidiah: that is, Beloved of the
\+nd LORD\+nd*\f* 
\p
\v 26 ¶ And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
and took the royal city. 
\v 27  And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. 
\v 28  Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be
called after my name.\f + \fr 12.28  \ft it be called…: Heb. my name be called upon
it\f* 
\v 29  And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
and fought against it, and took it. 
\v 30  And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof
\add was\add* a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was
\add set\add* on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
city in great abundance.\f + \fr 12.30  \ft in great…: Heb. very
great\f* 
\v 31  And he brought forth the people that \add were\add* therein, and
put \add them\add* under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under
axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus
did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the
people returned unto Jerusalem. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
had a fair sister, whose name \add was\add* Tamar; and Amnon the
son of David loved her. 
\v 2  And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she
\add was\add* a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any
thing to her.\f + \fr 13.2  \ft Amnon thought…: Heb. it was marvellous, or, hidden in the eyes of
Amnon\f* 
\v 3  But Amnon had a friend, whose name \add was\add* Jonadab, the
son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab \add was\add* a very
subtil man. 
\v 4  And he said unto him, Why \add art\add* thou, \add being\add*
the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And
Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.\f + \fr 13.4 
\ft lean: Heb. thin\f*\f + \fr 13.4  \ft from day…: Heb. morning by
morning\f* 
\v 5  And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself
sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my
sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight,
that I may see \add it\add*, and eat \add it\add* at her hand. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar
my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may
eat at her hand. 
\v 7  Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
Amnon’s house, and dress him meat. 
\v 8  So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid
down. And she took flour, and kneaded \add it\add*, and made cakes
in his sight, and did bake the cakes.\f + \fr 13.8  \ft flour: or,
paste\f* 
\v 9  And she took a pan, and poured \add them\add* out before him; but he
refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went
out every man from him. 
\v 10  And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had
made, and brought \add them\add* into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\v 11  And when she had brought \add them\add* unto him to eat, he took
hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. 
\v 12  And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing
ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.\f + \fr 13.12 
\ft force…: Heb. humble me\f*\f + \fr 13.12  \ft no such…: Heb. it ought not so to be
done\f* 
\v 13  And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as
one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the
king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 
\v 14  Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger
than she, forced her, and lay with her. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he
hated her \add was\add* greater than the love wherewith he had loved
her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.\f + \fr 13.15  \ft exceedingly: Heb. with great hatred
greatly\f* 
\v 16  And she said unto him, \add There is\add* no cause: this evil
in sending me away \add is\add* greater than the other that thou
didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her. 
\v 17  Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
Put now this \add woman\add* out from me, and bolt the door after her.
\v 18 And \add she had\add* a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
robes were the king’s daughters \add that were\add* virgins apparelled.
Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
colours that \add was\add* on her, and laid her hand on her head,
and went on crying. 
\v 20  And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he \add is\add*
thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her
brother Absalom’s house.\f + \fr 13.20  \ft Amnon: Heb. Aminon\f*\f + \fr 13.20 
\ft regard…: Heb. set not thy heart\f*\f + \fr 13.20  \ft desolate: Heb. and

\p
\v 21 ¶ But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
wroth. 
\v 22  And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor
bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which \add is\add* beside Ephraim: and
Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 
\v 24  And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant
hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants
go with thy servant. 
\v 25  And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he
would not go, but blessed him. 
\v 26  Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
\v 27  But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s
sons go with him. 
\p
\v 28 ¶ Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite
Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous,
and be valiant.\f + \fr 13.28  \ft have…: or, will you not, since I have commanded
you?\f*\f + \fr 13.28  \ft valiant: Heb. sons of valour\f* 
\v 29  And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him
up upon his mule, and fled.\f + \fr 13.29  \ft gat…: Heb. rode\f*
\p
\v 30 ¶ And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not
one of them left. 
\v 31  Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 
\v 32  And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered
and said, Let not my lord suppose \add that\add* they have slain
all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he
forced his sister Tamar.\f + \fr 13.32  \ft appointment: Heb. mouth\f*\f + \fr 13.32 
\ft determined: or, settled\f* 
\v 33  Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is
dead. 
\v 34  But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the
way of the hill side behind him. 
\v 35  And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come:
as thy servant said, so it is.\f + \fr 13.35  \ft as thy…: Heb. according to the word of thy
servant\f* 
\v 36  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and
wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.\f + \fr 13.36 
\ft very…: Heb. with a great weeping greatly\f* 
\p
\v 37 ¶ But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud,
king of Geshur. And \add David\add* mourned for his son every day.\f + \fr 13.37 
\ft Ammihud: or, Ammihur\f* 
\v 38  So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\v 39 And \add the soul of\add* king David longed to go forth unto
Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.\f + \fr 13.39 
\ft longed: or, was consumed\f* 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart
\add was\add* toward Absalom. 
\v 2  And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put
on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a
woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 
\v 3  And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
Joab put the words in her mouth. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her
face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.\f + \fr 14.4 
\ft Help: Heb. Save\f* 
\v 5  And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I
\add am\add* indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. 
\v 6  And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together
in the field, and \add there was\add* none to part them, but the
one smote the other, and slew him.\f + \fr 14.6  \ft none…: Heb. no deliverer between
them\f* 
\v 7  And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill
him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy
the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not
leave to my husband \add neither\add* name nor remainder upon the
earth.\f + \fr 14.7  \ft upon…: Heb. upon the face of the earth\f*
\v 8  And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give
charge concerning thee. 
\v 9  And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
the iniquity \add be\add* on me, and on my father’s house: and the
king and his throne \add be\add* guiltless. 
\v 10  And the king said, Whosoever saith \add ought\add* unto thee,
bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. 
\v 11  Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the \nd LORD\nd*
thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, \add As\add*
the \nd LORD\nd* liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall
to the earth.\f + \fr 14.11  \ft that…: Heb. that the revenger of blood do not multiply to
destroy\f* 
\v 12  Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
\add one\add* word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. 
\v 13  And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the
people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is
faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
\v 14  For we must needs die, and \add are\add* as water spilt on the
ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
\add any\add* person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished
be not expelled from him.\f + \fr 14.14  \ft neither…: or, because God hath not taken away his life, he hath also devised
means, etc\f* 
\v 15  Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
lord the king, \add it is\add* because the people have made me afraid:
and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the
king will perform the request of his handmaid. 
\v 16  For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
hand of the man \add that would\add* destroy me and my son together
out of the inheritance of God. 
\v 17  Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be
comfortable: for as an angel of God, so \add is\add* my lord the
king to discern good and bad: therefore the \nd LORD\nd* thy God will be with
thee.\f + \fr 14.17  \ft comfortable: Heb. for rest\f*\f + \fr 14.17 
\ft to discern: Heb. to hear\f* 
\v 18  Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the
thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the
king now speak. 
\v 19  And the king said, \add Is not\add* the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the
woman answered and said, \add As\add* thy soul liveth, my lord the
king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my
lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he
put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 
\v 20  To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
this thing: and my lord \add is\add* wise, according to the wisdom
of an angel of God, to know all \add things\add* that \add are\add*
in the earth. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. 
\v 22  And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have
found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath
fulfilled the request of his servant.\f + \fr 14.22  \ft thanked: Heb.

\v 23  So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\v 24  And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not
see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the
king’s face. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised  as
Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his
head there was no blemish in him.\f + \fr 14.25  \ft But…: Heb. And as Absalom there was not a beautiful man in all Israel to

\v 26  And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end
that he polled \add it:\add* because \add the hair\add* was heavy
on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head
at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight. 
\v 27  And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
whose name \add was\add* Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
\p
\v 28 ¶ So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
king’s face. 
\v 29  Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time,
he would not come. 
\v 30  Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is
near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s
servants set the field on fire.\f + \fr 14.30  \ft near…: Heb. near my

\v 31  Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto \add his\add* house,
and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
\v 32  And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I
come from Geshur? \add it had been\add* good for me \add to have
been\add* there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face;
and if there be \add any\add* iniquity in me, let him kill me. 
\v 33  So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots
and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
\v 2  And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
gate: and it was \add so\add*, that when any man that had a controversy
came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called  unto him, and
said, Of what city \add art\add* thou? And he said, Thy servant \add is\add*
of one of the tribes of Israel.\f + \fr 15.2  \ft came: Heb. to come\f*
\v 3  And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters \add are\add* good
and right; but \add there is\add* no man \add deputed\add* of the
king to hear thee.\f + \fr 15.3  \ft there…: or, none will hear thee from the king
downward\f* 
\v 4  Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him
justice! 
\v 5 And it was \add so\add*, that when any man came nigh \add to
him\add* to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and
kissed him. 
\v 6  And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the
\nd LORD\nd*, in Hebron. 
\v 8  For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
saying, If the \nd LORD\nd* shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
then I will serve the \nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 9  And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
to Hebron. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall
say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 
\v 11  And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, \add that
were\add* called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
not any thing. 
\v 12  And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor,
from his city, \add even\add* from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices.
And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually
with Absalom. 
\p
\v 13 ¶ And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
men of Israel are after Absalom. 
\v 14  And David said unto all his servants that \add were\add* with him at
Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not \add else\add*

and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.\f + \fr 15.14 
\ft bring: Heb. thrust\f* 
\v 15  And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants
\add are ready to do\add* whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.\f + \fr 15.15 
\ft appoint: Heb. choose\f* 
\v 16  And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the
king left ten women, \add which were\add* concubines, to keep the
house.\f + \fr 15.16  \ft after…: Heb. at his feet\f* 
\v 17  And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
tarried in a place that was far off. 
\v 18  And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which
came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest
thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou
\add art\add* a stranger, and also an exile. 
\v 20  Whereas thou camest \add but\add* yesterday, should I this
day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may,
return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth \add be\add* with
thee.\f + \fr 15.20  \ft go up…: Heb. wander in going\f* 
\v 21  And Ittai answered the king, and said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd*
liveth, and \add as\add* my lord the king liveth, surely in what
place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy
servant be. 
\v 22  And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that \add were\add* with him.
\v 23  And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron,
and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.\f + \fr 15.23 
\ft Kidron: Gr. Cedron\f* 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites \add were\add* with him,
bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark
of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing
out of the city. 
\v 25  And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*, he will bring me
again, and shew me \add both\add* it, and his habitation: 
\v 26  But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, \add here
am\add* I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 
\v 27  The king said also unto Zadok the priest, \add Art not\add*
thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
\v 28  See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
come word from you to certify me. 
\v 29  Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again
to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. 
\p
\v 30 ¶ And David went up by the ascent of \add mount\add* Olivet,
and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
and all the people that \add was\add* with him covered every man
his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.\f + \fr 15.30 
\ft and wept…: Heb. going up and weeping\f* 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And \add one\add* told David, saying, Ahithophel \add is\add*
among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O \nd LORD\nd*,
I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. 
\p
\v 32 ¶ And it came to pass, that \add when\add* David was come to the
top \add of the mount\add*, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai
the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his
head: 
\v 33  Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a
burden unto me: 
\v 34  But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy
servant, O king; \add as\add* I \add have been\add* thy father’s
servant hitherto, so \add will\add* I now also \add be\add* thy servant:
then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 
\v 35 And \add hast thou\add* not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar
the priests? therefore it shall be, \add that\add* what thing soever thou shalt
hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell \add it\add* to Zadok
and Abiathar the priests. 
\v 36 Behold, \add they have\add* there with them their two sons,
Ahimaaz Zadok’s \add son\add*, and Jonathan Abiathar’s \add son;\add*
and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. 
\v 37  So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came
into Jerusalem. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1  And when David was a little past the top \add of the hill\add*,
behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
asses saddled, and upon them two hundred \add loaves\add* of bread,
and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits,
and a bottle of wine. 
\v 2  And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
Ziba said, The asses \add be\add* for the king’s household to ride
on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the
wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. 
\v 3  And the king said, And where \add is\add* thy master’s son?
And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my
father. 
\v 4  Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine \add are\add* all that
\add pertained\add* unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee
\add that\add* I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.\f + \fr 16.4 
\ft I humbly…: Heb. I do obeisance\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out
a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name \add was\add*
Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.\f + \fr 16.5 
\ft he came forth…: or, he still came forth and cursed\f* 
\v 6  And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
David: and all the people and all the mighty men \add were\add* on his right
hand and on his left. 
\v 7  And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
bloody man, and thou man of Belial:\f + \fr 16.7  \ft bloody…: Heb. man of
blood\f* 
\v 8  The \nd LORD\nd* hath returned upon thee all the blood of the
house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the \nd LORD\nd*
hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou
\add art taken\add* in thy mischief, because thou \add art\add* a
bloody man.\f + \fr 16.8  \ft behold…: Heb. behold thee in thy evil\f*
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this
dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take
off his head. 
\v 10  And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the \nd LORD\nd* hath said unto him,
Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 
\v 11  And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh  my life: how much more now
\add may this\add* Benjamite \add do it\add*? let him alone, and let him
curse; for the \nd LORD\nd* hath bidden him. 
\v 12  It may be that the \nd LORD\nd* will look on mine affliction,
and that the \nd LORD\nd* will requite me good for his cursing this
day.\f + \fr 16.12  \ft affliction: or, tears: Heb. eye\f* 
\v 13  And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along
on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw
stones at him, and cast dust.\f + \fr 16.13  \ft cast…: Heb. dusted him with
dust\f* 
\v 14  And the king, and all the people that \add were\add* with him,
came weary, and refreshed themselves there. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
\v 16  And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend,
was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the
king, God save the king.\f + \fr 16.16  \ft God…: Heb. Let the king
live\f* 
\v 17  And Absalom said to Hushai, \add Is\add* this thy kindness
to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
\v 18  And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the \nd LORD\nd*,
and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I
abide. 
\v 19  And again, whom should I serve? \add should I\add* not \add serve\add*
in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence,
so will I be in thy presence. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall
do. 
\v 21  And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s
concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel
shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that
\add are\add* with thee be strong. 
\v 22  So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all
Israel. 
\v 23  And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
days, \add was\add* as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
\add was\add* all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
Absalom.\f + \fr 16.23  \ft oracle: Heb. word\f* 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1  Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this
night: 
\v 2  And I will come upon him while he \add is\add* weary and weak
handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that \add are\add*
with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 
\v 3  And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou
seekest \add is\add* as if all returned: \add so\add* all the people
shall be in peace. 
\v 4  And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
Israel.\f + \fr 17.4  \ft pleased…: Heb. was right in the eyes of,
etc\f* 
\v 5  Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
hear likewise what he saith.\f + \fr 17.5  \ft what…: Heb. what is in his
mouth\f* 
\v 6  And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do \add after\add*
his saying? if not; speak thou.\f + \fr 17.6  \ft his saying: Heb. his
word\f* 
\v 7  And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
given \add is\add* not good at this time.\f + \fr 17.7  \ft given: Heb.
counselled\f* 
\v 8  For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they
\add be\add* mighty men, and they \add be\add* chafed in their minds,
as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father \add is\add*
a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.\f + \fr 17.8  \ft chafed…: Heb. bitter of
soul\f* 
\v 9  Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some \add other\add*
place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown
at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter
among the people that follow Absalom.\f + \fr 17.9  \ft overthrown: Heb.
fallen\f* 
\v 10 And he also \add that is\add* valiant, whose heart \add is\add*
as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth
that thy father \add is\add* a mighty man, and \add they\add* which
\add be\add* with him \add are\add* valiant men. 
\v 11  Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered
unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that \add is\add*
by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
person.\f + \fr 17.11  \ft that thou…: Heb. that thy face, or, presence go,
etc\f* 
\v 12  So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground:
and of him and of all the men that \add are\add* with him there shall not be
left so much as one. 
\v 13  Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not
one small stone found there. 
\v 14  And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
Hushai the Archite \add is\add* better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
For the \nd LORD\nd* had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
Ahithophel, to the intent that the \nd LORD\nd* might bring evil
upon Absalom.\f + \fr 17.14  \ft appointed: Heb. commanded\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;
and thus and thus have I counselled. 
\v 16  Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge
not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that \add are\add* with him.
\v 17  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might
not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they
went and told king David. 
\v 18  Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim,
which had a well in his court; whither they went down. 
\v 19  And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth,
and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. 
\v 20  And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house,
they said, Where \add is\add* Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman
said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had
sought and could not find \add them\add*, they returned to Jerusalem.
\v 21  And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David,
Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel
counselled against you. 
\p
\v 22  Then David arose, and all the people that \add were\add* with him, and they passed
over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone
over Jordan. 
\p
\v 23 ¶ And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,
he saddled \add his\add* ass, and arose, and gat him home to his
house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and
died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.\f + \fr 17.23 
\ft followed: Heb. done\f*\f + \fr 17.23  \ft put his…: Heb. gave charge concerning his
house\f* 
\v 24  Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
he and all the men of Israel with him. 
\p
\v 25 ¶ And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
which Amasa \add was\add* a man’s son, whose name \add was\add* Ithra
an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister
to Zeruiah Joab’s mother.\f + \fr 17.25  \ft Ithra an Israelite: or, Jether an

\ft Nahash: or, Jesse\f* 
\v 26  So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 
\p
\v 27 ¶ And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir
the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\v 28  Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat,
and barley, and flour, and parched \add corn\add*, and beans, and
lentiles, and parched \add pulse\add*,\f + \fr 17.28  \ft basons: or,

\v 29  And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
David, and for the people that \add were\add* with him, to eat: for they
said, The people \add is\add* hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
wilderness. 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1  And David numbered the people that \add were\add* with him, and
set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
\v 2  And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you
myself also. 
\v 3  But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
will they care for us: but now \add thou art\add* worth ten thousand of us: therefore now
\add it is\add* better that thou succour us out of the city.\f + \fr 18.3 
\ft care…: Heb. set their heart on us\f*\f + \fr 18.3  \ft worth…: Heb. as ten thousand of

\v 4  And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out
by hundreds and by thousands. 
\v 5  And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
\add Deal\add* gently for my sake with the young man, \add even\add*
with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the
captains charge concerning Absalom. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ So the people went out into the field against  Israel: and the
battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 
\v 7  Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand
\add men\add*. 
\v 8  For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword
devoured.\f + \fr 18.8  \ft devoured: Heb. multiplied to devour\f*
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his
head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven
and the earth; and the mule that \add was\add* under him went away.
\v 10  And a certain man saw \add it\add*, and told Joab, and said,
Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. 
\v 11  And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
sawest \add him\add*, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
ground? and I would have given thee ten \add shekels\add* of silver,
and a girdle. 
\v 12  And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
\add shekels\add* of silver in mine hand, \add yet\add* would I not put
forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king
charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none \add touch\add*
the young man Absalom.\f + \fr 18.12  \ft receive: Heb. weigh upon mine

\v 13  Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have
set thyself against \add me\add*. 
\v 14  Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he
\add was\add* yet alive in the midst of the oak.\f + \fr 18.14  \ft with…: Heb. before
thee\f*\f + \fr 18.14  \ft midst: Heb. heart\f* 
\v 15  And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about
and smote Absalom, and slew him. 
\v 16  And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
\v 17  And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel
fled every one to his tent. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
pillar, which \add is\add* in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no
son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own
name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place. 
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear

\v 21  Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. 
\v 22  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said,
Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings

\v 24  And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went
up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes,
and looked, and behold a man running alone. 
\v 25  And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he
\add be\add* alone, \add there is\add* tidings in his mouth. And he
came apace, and drew near. 
\v 26  And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
called unto the porter, and said, Behold \add another\add* man running
alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 
\v 27  And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He
\add is\add* a good man, and cometh with good tidings.\f + \fr 18.27 
\ft Me…: Heb. I see the running\f* 
\v 28  And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell
down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed
\add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, which hath delivered up the

\v 29  And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz

\ft Is…: Heb. Is there peace?\f* 
\v 30  And the king said \add unto him\add*, Turn aside, \add and\add*

\v 31  And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord

\p
\v 33 ¶ And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my
son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my
son, my son! 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1  And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
for Absalom. 
\v 2  And the victory that day was \add turned\add* into mourning

\v 3  And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city,
as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
\v 4  But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
\v 5  And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have
saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the
lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
\v 6  In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.
For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes
nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived,
and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.\f + \fr 19.6

\v 7  Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy

\v 8  Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the
people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the
people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his
tent. 
\p
\v 9 ¶ And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies,
and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is
fled out of the land for Absalom. 
\v 10  And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?\f + \fr 19.10 
\ft speak…: Heb. are ye silent?\f* 
\p
\v 11 ¶ And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last
to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel
is come to the king, \add even\add* to his house. 
\v 12 Ye \add are\add* my brethren, ye \add are\add* my bones and my
flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 
\v 13  And say ye to Amasa, \add Art\add* thou not of my bone, and of my
flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
host before me continually in the room of Joab. 
\v 14  And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as \add the heart
of\add* one man; so that they sent \add this word\add* unto the king,
Return thou, and all thy servants. 
\v 15  So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which \add was\add*
of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king
David. 
\v 17 And \add there were\add* a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and
Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
\v 18  And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s
household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of
Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;\f + \fr 19.18 
\ft what…: Heb. the good in his eyes\f* 
\v 19  And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou
remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord
the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his
heart. 
\v 20  For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am
come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king. 
\v 21  But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the \nd LORD’s\nd*
anointed? 
\v 22  And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah,
that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man
be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I \add am\add*
this day king over Israel? 
\v 23  Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the
king sware unto him. 
\p
\v 24 ¶ And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed
his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came
\add again\add* in peace. 
\v 25  And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet
the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
Mephibosheth? 
\v 26  And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy
servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and
go to the king; because thy servant \add is\add* lame. 
\v 27  And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my
lord the king \add is\add* as an angel of God: do therefore \add what
is\add* good in thine eyes. 
\v 28 For all \add of\add* my father’s house were but dead men before my
lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the
king?\f + \fr 19.28  \ft dead…: Heb. men of death\f* 
\v 29  And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy

\v 30  And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own
house. 
\p
\v 31 ¶ And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 
\v 32  Now Barzillai was a very aged man, \add even\add* fourscore
years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay
at Mahanaim; for he \add was\add* a very great man. 
\v 33  And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will
feed thee with me in Jerusalem. 
\v 34  And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?\f + \fr 19.34 
\ft How…: Heb. How many days are the years of my life\f* 
\v 35 I \add am\add* this day fourscore years old: \add and\add*
can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I
eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men
and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden
unto my lord the king? 
\v 36  Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
\v 37  Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may
die in mine own city, \add and be buried\add* by the grave of my
father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go
over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
\v 38  And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will
do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt
require of me, \add that\add* will I do for thee.\f + \fr 19.38 
\ft require: Heb. choose\f* 
\v 39  And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned
unto his own place. 
\p
\v 40  Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the
people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.\f + \fr 19.40 
\ft Chimham: Heb. Chimhan\f* 
\p
\v 41 ¶ And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and
said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee
away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s
men with him, over Jordan? 
\v 42  And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the
king \add is\add* near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this
matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s \add cost\add*? or hath he
given us any gift? 
\v 43  And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more \add right\add*
in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be
first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of
Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.\f + \fr 19.43 
\ft despise…: Heb. set us at light\f* 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1  And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name
\add was\add* Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew
a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance
in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. 
\v 2  So every man of Israel went up from after David, \add and\add*
followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
the ten women \add his\add* concubines, whom he had left to keep
the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut
up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.\f + \fr 20.3

\v 4 ¶ Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
within three days, and be thou here present.\f + \fr 20.4  \ft Assemble: Heb.

\v 5  So Amasa went to assemble \add the men of\add* Judah: but he tarried

\ft Assemble: Heb. Call\f* 
\v 6  And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
do us more harm than \add did\add* Absalom: take thou thy lord’s

escape us.\f + \fr 20.6  \ft escape…: Heb. deliver himself from our

\v 7  And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites,
and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of
Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
\v 8 When they \add were\add* at the great stone which \add is\add*
in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put
on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle \add with\add* a sword
fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth
it fell out. 
\v 9  And Joab said to Amasa, \add Art\add* thou in health, my brother?
And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
\v 10  But Amasa took no heed to the sword that \add was\add* in
Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth \add rib\add*,
and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again;
and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued  after Sheba
the son of Bichri.\f + \fr 20.10  \ft struck…: Heb. doubled not his

\v 11  And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
Joab, and he that \add is\add* for David, \add let him go\add* after
Joab. 
\v 12  And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the
man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the
highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that
came by him stood still. 
\v 13  When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together,
and went also after him. 
\v 15  And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast
up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the
people that \add were\add* with Joab battered the wall, to throw it
down.\f + \fr 20.15  \ft in the trench: or, against the outmost wall\f*\f + \fr 20.15

\p
\v 16 ¶ Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say,
I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
\v 17  And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, \add Art\add*
thou Joab? And he answered, I \add am he\add*. Then she said unto him,
Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. 
\v 18  Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
saying, They shall surely ask \add counsel\add* at Abel: and so they
ended \add the matter\add*.\f + \fr 20.18  \ft They were…: or, They plainly spake in the beginning, saying, Surely they will

\v 19 I \add am one of them that are\add* peaceable \add and\add*

Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 20  And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow
up or destroy. 
\v 21  The matter \add is\add* not so: but a man of mount Ephraim,
Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
king, \add even\add* against David: deliver him only, and I will
depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
shall be thrown to thee over the wall.\f + \fr 20.21  \ft by name: Heb. by his

\v 22  Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut
off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast \add it\add* out to

\p
\v 23 ¶ Now Joab \add was\add* over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah

\c 21  
\p
\v 1  Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year

answered, \add It is\add* for Saul, and for \add his\add* bloody

\v 2  And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
Gibeonites \add were\add* not of the children of Israel, but of the
remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and
Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and
Judah.) 
\v 3  Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the
atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 4  And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any
man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, \add that\add* will I
do for you.\f + \fr 21.4  \ft We will…: or, It is not silver nor gold that we have to do with Saul or his house, neither

\v 5  And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that

\v 6  Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them
up unto the \nd LORD\nd* in Gibeah of Saul, \add whom\add* the \nd LORD\nd*

\ft whom…: or, chosen of the \+nd LORD\+nd*\f* 
\v 7  But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
of Saul, because of the \nd LORD’s\nd* oath that \add was\add* between them, between
David and Jonathan the son of Saul. 
\v 8  But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons
of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the
son of Barzillai the Meholathite:\f + \fr 21.8  \ft Michal: or, Michal’s

\v 9  And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they

first \add days\add*, in the beginning of barley harvest. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread
it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
dropped  upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds
of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by
night. 
\v 11  And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
concubine of Saul, had done. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen
them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged
them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 
\v 13  And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were
hanged. 
\v 14  And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father:
and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God
was intreated for the land. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
Philistines: and David waxed faint. 
\v 16  And Ishbi-benob, which \add was\add* of the sons of the giant,

stamp them as the mire of the street, \add and\add* did spread them
abroad. 
\v 44  Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
thou hast kept me \add to be\add* head of the heathen: a people \add which\add*
I knew not shall serve me. 
\v 45  Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they

\v 46  Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close

\v 47  The \nd LORD\nd* liveth; and blessed \add be\add* my rock;
and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. 
\v 48 It \add is\add* God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down

for\f* 
\v 49  And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on
high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the
violent man. 
\v 50  Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O \nd LORD\nd*, among the
heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. 
\v 51  \add He is\add* the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth
mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Now these \add be\add* the last words of David. David the son
of Jesse said, and the man \add who was\add* raised up on high, the
anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
\v 2  The Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* spake by me, and his word \add was\add*
in my tongue. 
\v 3  The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
ruleth over men \add must be\add* just, ruling in the fear of God.\f + \fr 23.3 
\ft He…: or, Be thou ruler, etc\f* 
\v 4 And \add he shall be\add* as the light of the morning, \add when\add*
the sun riseth, \add even\add* a morning without clouds; \add as\add*
the tender grass \add springing\add* out of the earth by clear shining
after rain. 
\v 5  Although my house \add be\add* not so with God; yet he hath
made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all \add things\add*,
and sure: for \add this is\add* all my salvation, and all \add my\add*
desire, although he make \add it\add* not to grow. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ But \add the sons\add* of Belial \add shall be\add* all of them as
thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 
\v 7  But the man \add that\add* shall touch them must be fenced
with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned
with fire in the \add same\add* place.\f + \fr 23.7  \ft fenced: Heb.
filled\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ These \add be\add* the names of the mighty men whom David
had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same
\add was\add* Adino the Eznite: \add he lift up his spear\add* against
eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.\f + \fr 23.8  \ft The Tachmonite…: or, Joshebbassebet the Tachmonite, head of the

\v 9  And after him \add was\add* Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite,
\add one\add* of the three mighty men with David, when they defied
the Philistines \add that\add* were there gathered together to battle,
and the men of Israel were gone away: 
\v 10  He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
and his hand clave unto the sword: and the \nd LORD\nd* wrought a
great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to
spoil. 
\v 11  And after him \add was\add* Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite.
And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a
piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.\f + \fr 23.11 
\ft into…: or, for foraging\f* 
\v 12  But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
slew the Philistines: and the \nd LORD\nd* wrought a great victory.
\v 13  And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David
in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the
Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.\f + \fr 23.13  \ft three…: or, the three captains over the
thirty\f* 
\v 14  And David \add was\add* then in an hold, and the garrison
of the Philistines \add was\add* then \add in\add* Beth-lehem. 
\v 15  And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink
of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which \add is\add* by the
gate! 
\v 16  And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines,
and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that \add was\add*
by the gate, and took \add it\add*, and brought \add it\add* to David:
nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the
\nd LORD\nd*. 
\v 17  And he said, Be it far from me, O \nd LORD\nd*, that I should
do this: \add is not this\add* the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their
lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three
mighty men. 
\v 18  And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred,
\add and\add* slew \add them\add*, and had the name among three.\f + \fr 23.18 
\ft and slew them: Heb. slain\f* 
\v 19  Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
captain: howbeit he attained not unto the \add first\add* three.
\v 20  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man,
of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab:
he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of
snow:\f + \fr 23.20  \ft who…: Heb. great of acts\f*\f + \fr 23.20 
\ft lionlike…: Heb. lion of God\f* 
\v 21  And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked
the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.\f + \fr 23.21 
\ft a goodly…: Heb. a man of countenance, or, sight: also called, a man of great
stature\f* 
\v 22 These \add things\add* did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the
name among three mighty men. 
\v 23  He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the
\add first\add* three. And David set him over his guard.\f + \fr 23.23 
\ft more…: or, honourable among the thirty\f*\f + \fr 23.23  \ft guard: or, council: Heb. at his

\v 24  Asahel the brother of Joab \add was\add* one of the thirty;
Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem, 
\v 25  Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
\v 26  Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 
\v 27  Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
\v 28  Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
\v 29  Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, 
\v 30  Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,\f + \fr 23.30 
\ft brooks: or, valleys\f* 
\v 31  Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
\v 32  Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
\v 33  Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
\v 34  Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
\v 35  Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 
\v 36  Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
\v 37  Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to
Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
\v 38  Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, 
\v 39  Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1  And again the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against
Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel
and Judah. 
\v 2  For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which \add was\add*
with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to
Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number
of the people.\f + \fr 24.2  \ft Go: or, Compass\f* 
\v 3  And Joab said unto the king, Now the \nd LORD\nd* thy God add
unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
eyes of my lord the king may see \add it:\add* but why doth my lord
the king delight in this thing? 
\v 4  Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the
captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went
out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right
side of the city that \add lieth\add* in the midst of the river of
Gad, and toward Jazer:\f + \fr 24.5  \ft river: or, valley\f* 
\v 6  Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi;
and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,\f + \fr 24.6  \ft land of Tahtim-hodshi: or, nether land newly
inhabited\f* 
\v 7  And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities
of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south
of Judah, \add even\add* to Beer-sheba. 
\v 8  So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem
at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
\v 9  And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men
that drew the sword; and the men of Judah \add were\add* five hundred
thousand men. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the
people. And David said unto the \nd LORD\nd*, I have sinned greatly
in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O \nd LORD\nd*, take
away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\v 11  For when David was up in the morning, the word of the \nd LORD\nd*
came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
\v 12  Go and say unto David, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I offer
thee three \add things;\add* choose  thee one of them, that I may
\add do it\add* unto thee. 
\v 13  So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee
three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be
three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer
I shall return to him that sent me. 
\v 14  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
now into the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*; for his mercies \add are\add*
great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.\f + \fr 24.14  \ft are great: or, are
many\f* 
\p
\v 15 ¶ So the \nd LORD\nd* sent a pestilence upon Israel from the
morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people
from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. 
\v 16  And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
destroy it, the \nd LORD\nd* repented him of the evil, and said to the
angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand.
And the angel of the \nd LORD\nd* was by the threshingplace of Araunah
the Jebusite.\f + \fr 24.16  \ft Araunah: also called, Ornan\f* 
\v 17  And David spake unto the \nd LORD\nd* when he saw the angel
that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my
father’s house. 
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up,
rear an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd* in the threshingfloor of Araunah
the Jebusite.\f + \fr 24.18  \ft Araunah: Heb. Araniah\f* 
\v 19  And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the
\nd LORD\nd* commanded. 
\v 20  And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the
king on his face upon the ground. 
\v 21  And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build
an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*, that the plague may be stayed from the
people. 
\v 22  And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer
up what \add seemeth\add* good unto him: behold, \add here be\add*
oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and \add other\add*
instruments of the oxen for wood. 
\v 23 All these \add things\add* did Araunah, \add as\add* a king,
give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The \nd LORD\nd*
thy God accept  thee. 
\v 24  And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy
\add it\add* of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings
unto the \nd LORD\nd* my God of that which doth cost me nothing.
So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels
of silver. 
\v 25  And David built there an altar unto the \nd LORD\nd*, and
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the \nd LORD\nd*
was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
