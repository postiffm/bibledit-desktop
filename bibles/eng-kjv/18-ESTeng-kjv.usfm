\v 1  Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this \add is\add*
Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, \add over\add*
an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) 
\v 2  \add That\add* in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the
throne of his kingdom, which \add was\add* in Shushan the palace,
\v 3  In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles
and princes of the provinces, \add being\add* before him: 
\v 4  When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour
of his excellent majesty many days, \add even\add* an hundred and
fourscore days. 
\v 5  And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the
people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and
small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;\f + \fr 1.5 
\ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 6  \add Where were\add* white, green, and blue, \add hangings\add*,
fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and
pillars of marble: the beds \add were of\add* gold and silver, upon a
pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.\f + \fr 1.6 
\ft blue, hangings: or, violet, etc\f*\f + \fr 1.6  \ft of red…: or, of porphyre, and marble and alabaster, and stone of blue
colour\f* 
\v 7 And they gave \add them\add* drink in vessels of gold, (the
vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
according to the state of the king.\f + \fr 1.7  \ft royal…: Heb. wine of the
kingdom\f*\f + \fr 1.7  \ft state: Heb. hand\f* 
\v 8  And the drinking \add was\add* according to the law; none did
compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his
house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure. 
\v 9  Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women \add in\add*
the royal house which \add belonged\add* to king Ahasuerus. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry
with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,
Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence
of Ahasuerus the king,\f + \fr 1.10  \ft chamberlains: or, eunuchs\f*
\v 11  To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal,
to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she \add was\add*
fair to look on.\f + \fr 1.11  \ft fair…: Heb. good of countenance\f*
\v 12  But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment
by \add his\add* chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth,
and his anger burned in him.\f + \fr 1.12  \ft by his…: Heb. which was by the hand of his
eunuchs\f* 
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so
\add was\add* the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
\v 14  And the next unto him \add was\add* Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, \add and\add* Memucan, the seven princes
of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face, \add and\add* which
sat the first in the kingdom;) 
\v 15  What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not
performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?\f + \fr 1.15 
\ft What…: Heb. What to do\f* 
\v 16  And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the
princes, and to all the people that \add are\add* in all the provinces
of the king Ahasuerus. 
\v 17 For \add this\add* deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all
women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be
reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought
in before him, but she came not. 
\v 18  \add Likewise\add* shall the ladies of Persia and Media say
this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed
of the queen. Thus \add shall there arise\add* too much contempt
and wrath. 
\v 19  If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the
Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king
Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is
better than she.\f + \fr 1.19  \ft If it…: Heb. If it be good with the
king\f*\f + \fr 1.19  \ft unto…: Heb. unto her companion\f*\f + \fr 1.19 
\ft from him: Heb. from before him\f*\f + \fr 1.19  \ft be not…: Heb. pass not
away\f* 
\v 20  And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published
throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall
give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. 
\v 21  And the saying pleased  the king and the princes; and the
king did according to the word of Memucan:\f + \fr 1.21  \ft pleased…: Heb. was good in the eyes of the
king\f* 
\v 22  For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every
province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their
language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that
\add it\add* should be published according to the language of every
people.\f + \fr 1.22  \ft that it…: Heb. that one should publish it according to the language of his
people\f* 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1  After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,
he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\v 2  Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be
fair young virgins sought for the king: 
\v 3  And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins
unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody
of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper  of the women; and let their things for
purification be given \add them:\add*\f + \fr 2.3  \ft unto the…: Heb. unto the
hand\f*\f + \fr 2.3  \ft Hege: also called, Hegai\f* 
\v 4  And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. 
\p
\v 5 ¶ \add Now\add* in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew,
whose name \add was\add* Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei,
the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 
\v 6  Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon had carried away.\f + \fr 2.6  \ft Jeconiah: also called,
Jehoiachin\f* 
\v 7  And he brought up Hadassah, that \add is\add*, Esther, his
uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the
maid \add was\add* fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father
and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.\f + \fr 2.7  \ft brought…: Heb.
nourished\f*\f + \fr 2.7  \ft fair…: Heb. fair of form, and good of
countenance\f* 
\p
\v 8 ¶ So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree
was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan
the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the
king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 
\v 9  And the maiden pleased  him, and she obtained kindness of him;
and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as
belonged to her, and seven maidens, \add which were\add* meet to be
given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her
maids unto the best \add place\add* of the house of the women.\f + \fr 2.9 
\ft such…: Heb. her portions\f*\f + \fr 2.9  \ft preferred: Heb.
changed\f* 
\v 10  Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
had charged her that she should not shew \add it\add*. 
\v 11  And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s
house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.\f + \fr 2.11 
\ft to know…: Heb. to know the peace\f* 
\p
\v 12 ¶ Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the
women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished,
\add to wit\add*, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet
odours, and with \add other\add* things for the purifying of the
women;) 
\v 13  Then thus came \add every\add* maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women
unto the king’s house. 
\v 14  In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s
chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king
no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called
by name. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the
uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go
in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s
chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained
favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 
\v 16  So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
in the tenth month, which \add is\add* the month Tebeth, in the seventh
year of his reign. 
\v 17  And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained
grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he
set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of
Vashti.\f + \fr 2.17  \ft favour: or, kindness\f*\f + \fr 2.17  \ft in his…: Heb. before
him\f* 
\v 18  Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
servants, \add even\add* Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the
provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.\f + \fr 2.18 
\ft release: Heb. rest\f* 
\v 19  And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate. 
\v 20  Esther had not \add yet\add* shewed her kindred nor her people;
as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai,
like as when she was brought up with him. 
\p
\v 21 ¶ In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two
of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept
the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.\f + \fr 2.21 
\ft Bigthan: also called, Bigthana\f*\f + \fr 2.21  \ft the door: Heb. the
threshold\f* 
\v 22  And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told \add it\add*
unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king \add thereof\add*
in Mordecai’s name. 
\v 23  And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found
out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
in the book of the chronicles before the king. 
\c 3  
\p
\v 1  After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son
of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the
princes that \add were\add* with him. 
\v 2  And all the king’s servants, that \add were\add* in the king’s
gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did \add him\add* reverence.
\v 3  Then the king’s servants, which \add were\add* in the king’s
gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?
\v 4  Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s
matters would stand: for he had told them that he \add was\add* a
Jew. 
\v 5  And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
then was Haman full of wrath. 
\v 6  And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy
all the Jews that \add were\add* throughout the whole kingdom of
Ahasuerus, \add even\add* the people of Mordecai. 
\p
\v 7 ¶ In the first month, that \add is\add*, the month Nisan, in the
twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that \add is\add*,
the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, \add to\add*
the twelfth \add month\add*, that \add is\add*, the month Adar. 
\p
\v 8 ¶ And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces
of thy kingdom; and their laws \add are\add* diverse from all people;
neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it \add is\add* not for the
king’s profit to suffer them.\f + \fr 3.8  \ft for the…: Heb. meet or, equal,
etc\f* 
\v 9  If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed:
and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the
charge of the business, to bring \add it\add* into the king’s treasuries.\f + \fr 3.9 
\ft that they…: Heb. to destroy them\f*\f + \fr 3.9  \ft pay: Heb.
weigh\f* 
\v 10  And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.\f + \fr 3.10 
\ft enemy: or, oppressor\f* 
\v 11  And the king said unto Haman, The silver \add is\add* given
to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
\v 12  Then were the king’s scribes  called on the thirteenth day
of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman
had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that
\add were\add* over every province, and to the rulers of every people
of every province according to the writing thereof, and \add to\add*
every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus
was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring.\f + \fr 3.12  \ft scribes: or,
secretaries\f* 
\v 13  And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces,
to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young
and old, little children and women, in one day, \add even\add* upon the
thirteenth \add day\add* of the twelfth month, which is the month
Adar, and \add to take\add* the spoil of them for a prey. 
\v 14  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people, that they should be ready
against that day. 
\v 15  The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment,
and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and
Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed. 
\c 4  
\p
\v 1  When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst
of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 
\v 2  And came even before the king’s gate: for none \add might\add*
enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. 
\v 3  And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment
and his decree came, \add there was\add* great mourning among the
Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth
and ashes.\f + \fr 4.3  \ft many…: Heb. sackcloth and ashes were laid under
many\f* 
\p
\v 4 ¶ So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told \add it\add*
her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment
to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he
received \add it\add* not.\f + \fr 4.4  \ft chamberlains: Heb. eunuchs\f*
\p
\v 5  Then called Esther for Hatach, \add one\add* of the king’s
chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
commandment to Mordecai, to know what it \add was\add*, and why it
\add was\add*.\f + \fr 4.5  \ft appointed…: Heb. set before her\f*
\v 6  So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which
\add was\add* before the king’s gate. 
\v 7  And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the
sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries
for the Jews, to destroy them. 
\v 8  Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew \add it\add* unto Esther,
and to declare \add it\add* unto her, and to charge her that she should go
in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request
before him for her people. 
\v 9  And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
\p
\v 10 ¶ Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment
unto Mordecai; 
\v 11  All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces,
do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the
king into the inner court, who is not called, \add there is\add*
one law of his to put \add him\add* to death, except such to whom the
king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been
called to come in unto the king these thirty days. 
\v 12  And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words. 
\v 13  Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.
\v 14  For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, \add then\add*
shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another
place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for \add such\add* a
time as this?\f + \fr 4.14  \ft enlargement: Heb. respiration\f*
\p
\v 15 ¶ Then Esther bade \add them\add* return Mordecai \add this
answer\add*, 
\v 16  Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or
day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the
king, which \add is\add* not according to the law: and if I perish,
I perish.\f + \fr 4.16  \ft present: Heb. found\f* 
\v 17  So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
had commanded him.\f + \fr 4.17  \ft went…: Heb. passed\f* 
\c 5  
\p
\v 1  Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on \add her\add*
royal \add apparel\add*, and stood in the inner court of the king’s
house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal
throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. 
\v 2  And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing
in the court, \add that\add* she obtained favour in his sight: and the
king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that \add was\add* in his
hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. 
\v 3  Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what
\add is\add* thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
of the kingdom. 
\v 4  And Esther answered, If \add it seem\add* good unto the king,
let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
prepared for him. 
\v 5  Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may
do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
that Esther had prepared. 
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What
\add is\add* thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what
\add is\add* thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
performed. 
\v 7  Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request
\add is;\add* 
\v 8  If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request,
let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will
do to morrow as the king hath said.\f + \fr 5.8  \ft perform: Heb.
do\f* 
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not
up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
\v 10  Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.\f + \fr 5.10 
\ft called…: Heb. caused to come\f* 
\v 11  And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
of his children, and all \add the things\add* wherein the king had
promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants
of the king. 
\v 12  Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to
morrow am I invited unto her also with the king. 
\v 13  Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
the Jew sitting at the king’s gate. 
\p
\v 14 ¶ Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the
king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily
with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he
caused the gallows to be made.\f + \fr 5.14  \ft gallows: Heb. tree\f*
\c 6  
\p
\v 1  On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before
the king.\f + \fr 6.1  \ft could…: Heb. the king’s sleep fled away\f*
\v 2  And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door,
who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.\f + \fr 6.2  \ft Bigthana: also called,
Bigthan\f*\f + \fr 6.2  \ft door: Heb. threshold\f* 
\v 3  And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered
unto him, There is nothing done for him. 
\p
\v 4 ¶ And the king said, Who \add is\add* in the court? Now Haman
was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the
king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
\v 5  And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. 
\v 6  So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought
in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to
myself?\f + \fr 6.6  \ft whom the king…: Heb. in whose honour the king
delighteth\f* 
\v 7  And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth
 to honour,\f + \fr 6.7  \ft whom the king…: Heb. in whose honour the king
delighteth\f* 
\v 8  Let the royal apparel be brought which the king \add useth\add*
to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
which is set upon his head:\f + \fr 6.8  \ft Let…: Heb. Let them bring the royal
apparel\f*\f + \fr 6.8  \ft which the king…: Heb. wherewith the king clotheth
himself\f* 
\v 9  And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of
one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man
\add withal\add* whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be
done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.\f + \fr 6.9 
\ft bring…: Heb. cause him to ride\f* 
\v 10  Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, \add and\add* take
the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast
spoken.\f + \fr 6.10  \ft let…: Heb. suffer not a whit to fall\f*
\v 11  Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and
proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the
king delighteth  to honour. 
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted
to his house mourning, and having his head covered. 
\v 13  And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every \add thing\add*
that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife
unto him, If Mordecai \add be\add* of the seed of the Jews, before
whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt
surely fall before him. 
\v 14 And while they \add were\add* yet talking with him, came the
king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
Esther had prepared. 
\c 7  
\p
\v 1  So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.\f + \fr 7.1 
\ft to banquet: Heb. to drink\f* 
\v 2  And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
banquet of wine, What \add is\add* thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be
granted thee: and what \add is\add* thy request? and it shall be
performed, \add even\add* to the half of the kingdom. 
\v 3  Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour
in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given
me at my petition, and my people at my request: 
\v 4  For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain,
and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen,
I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the
king’s damage.\f + \fr 7.4  \ft to be destroyed…: Heb. that they should destroy, and kill, and cause to
perish\f* 
\p
\v 5 ¶ Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart
to do so?\f + \fr 7.5  \ft that…: Heb. whose heart hath filled him\f*
\v 6  And Esther said, The adversary and enemy \add is\add* this
wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.\f + \fr 7.6

\add went\add* into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was
evil determined against him by the king. 
\v 8  Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon
Esther \add was\add*. Then said the king, Will he force the queen
also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth,
they covered Haman’s face.\f + \fr 7.8  \ft before me: Heb. with
me\f* 
\v 9  And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made
for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house
of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.\f + \fr 7.9  \ft gallows: Heb.
tree\f* 
\v 10  So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified. 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1  On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman
the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the
king; for Esther had told what he \add was\add* unto her. 
\v 2  And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house
of Haman. 
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down
at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief
of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the
Jews.\f + \fr 8.3  \ft and besought…: Heb. and she wept, and besought
him\f* 
\v 4  Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So
Esther arose, and stood before the king, 
\v 5  And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour
in his sight, and the thing \add seem\add* right before the king, and I
\add be\add* pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the
letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he
wrote to destroy the Jews which \add are\add* in all the king’s provinces:\f + \fr 8.5 
\ft devised: Heb. the device\f*\f + \fr 8.5  \ft which he…: or, who
wrote\f* 
\v 6  For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my
people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?\f + \fr 8.6 
\ft endure…: Heb. be able that I may see\f* 
\p
\v 7 ¶ Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman,
and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand
upon the Jews. 
\v 8  Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s
name, and seal \add it\add* with the king’s ring: for the writing
which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring,
may no man reverse. 
\v 9  Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third
month, that \add is\add*, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth
\add day\add* thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai
commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies
and rulers of the provinces which \add are\add* from India unto Ethiopia,
an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the
writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the
Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
\v 10  And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed \add it\add*
with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, \add and\add*
riders  on mules, camels, \add and\add* young dromedaries: 
\v 11  Wherein the king granted the Jews which \add were\add* in every
city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life,
to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the
people and province that would assault them, \add both\add* little
ones and women, and \add to take\add* the spoil of them for a prey,
\v 12  Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, \add namely\add*,
upon the thirteenth \add day\add* of the twelfth month, which \add is\add*
the month Adar. 
\v 13  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province \add was\add* published unto all people, and that the Jews
should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.\f + \fr 8.13 
\ft published: Heb. revealed\f* 
\v 14  \add So\add* the posts that rode upon mules \add and\add*
camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment.
And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. 
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a
garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced
and was glad.\f + \fr 8.15  \ft blue: or, violet\f* 
\v 16  The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. 
\v 17  And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness,
a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became
Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them. 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1  Now in the twelfth month, that \add is\add*, the month Adar,
on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his
decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies
of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned
to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
\v 2  The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the
provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their
hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell
upon all people. 
\v 3  And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the
fear of Mordecai fell upon them.\f + \fr 9.3  \ft officers…: Heb. those which did the business that belonged to the
king\f* 
\v 4  For Mordecai \add was\add* great in the king’s house, and his
fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai
waxed greater and greater. 
\v 5  Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that
hated them.\f + \fr 9.5  \ft what…: Heb. according to their will\f*
\v 6  And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
hundred men. 
\v 7  And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 
\v 8  And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 
\v 9  And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, 
\v 10  The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. 
\v 11  On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan
the palace was brought before the king.\f + \fr 9.11  \ft was…: Heb.

\p
\v 12 ¶ And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten
sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what
\add is\add* thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what
\add is\add* thy request further? and it shall be done. 
\v 13  Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted
to the Jews which \add are\add* in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.\f + \fr 9.13 
\ft let Haman’s…: Heb. let men hang, etc\f* 
\v 14  And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons. 
\v 15  For the Jews that \add were\add* in Shushan gathered themselves
together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
\v 16  But the other Jews that \add were\add* in the king’s provinces
gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had
rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey, 
\v 17  On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.\f + \fr 9.17 
\ft of the same: Heb. in it\f* 
\v 18  But the Jews that \add were\add* at Shushan assembled together
on the thirteenth \add day\add* thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the
fifteenth \add day\add* of the same they rested, and made it a day
of feasting and gladness. 
\v 19  Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar \add a day of\add*
gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one
to another. 
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
Jews that \add were\add* in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
\add both\add* nigh and far, 
\v 21  To stablish \add this\add* among them, that they should keep
the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same,
yearly, 
\v 22  As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the
month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning
into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and
joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\v 23  And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai
had written unto them; 
\v 24  Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy
of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had
cast Pur, that \add is\add*, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy
them;\f + \fr 9.24  \ft consume: Heb. crush\f* 
\v 25 But when \add Esther\add* came before the king, he commanded
by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be
hanged on the gallows.\f + \fr 9.25  \ft when…: Heb. when she came\f*
\v 26  Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
Therefore for all the words of this letter, and \add of that\add*
which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto
them,\f + \fr 9.26  \ft Pur: that is, Lot\f* 
\v 27  The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not
fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their
\add appointed\add* time every year;\f + \fr 9.27  \ft fail: Heb.

\v 28 And \add that\add* these days \add should be\add* remembered
and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province,
and every city; and \add that\add* these days of Purim should not
fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their
seed.\f + \fr 9.28  \ft fail: Heb. pass\f*\f + \fr 9.28  \ft perish: Heb. be

\v 29  Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter
of Purim.\f + \fr 9.29  \ft authority: Heb. strength\f* 
\v 30  And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, \add with\add*
words of peace and truth, 
\v 31  To confirm these days of Purim in their times \add appointed\add*,
according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had
decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings
and their cry.\f + \fr 9.31  \ft themselves: Heb. their souls\f*
\v 32  And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim;
and it was written in the book. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1  And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and \add upon\add*
the isles of the sea. 
\v 2  And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration
of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, \add are\add*
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media
and Persia?\f + \fr 10.2  \ft advanced…: Heb. made him great\f* 
\v 3  For Mordecai the Jew \add was\add* next unto king Ahasuerus,
and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
