\ms1 BOOK I 
\q1
\v 1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,
\q1 Nor standeth in the way of sinners, 
\q1 Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers: 
\q1
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; 
\q1 And on his law doth he meditate day and night. 
\q1
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
\q1 That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, 
\q1 Whose leaf also doth not wither; 
\q1 And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. 
\q1
\v 4 The wicked are not so, 
\q1 But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, 
\q1 Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
\q1
\v 6 For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; 
\q1 But the way of the wicked shall perish. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 Why do the nations rage, 
\q1 And the peoples meditate a vain thing? 
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, 
\q1 And the rulers take counsel together, 
\q1 Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, \add saying\add*,
\q1
\v 3 Let us break their bonds asunder, 
\q1 And cast away their cords from us. 
\q1
\v 4 He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: 
\q1 The Lord will have them in derision. 
\q1
\v 5 Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, 
\q1 And vex them in his sore displeasure: 
\q1
\v 6 Yet I have set my king 
\q1 Upon my holy hill of Zion. 
\q1
\v 7 I will tell of the decree: 
\q1 Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; 
\q1 This day have I begotten thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give \add thee\add* the nations for thine inheritance,
\q1 And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; 
\q1 Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: 
\q1 Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
\q1
\v 11 Serve Jehovah with fear, 
\q1 And rejoice with trembling. 
\q1
\v 12 Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, 
\q1 For his wrath will soon be kindled. 
\q1 Blessed are all they that take refuge in him. 
\c 3  
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. 
\b
\q1
\v 1 Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! 
\q1 Many are they that rise up against me. 
\q1
\v 2 Many there are that say of my soul, 
\q1 There is no help for him in God. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 3 But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; 
\q1 My glory, and the lifter up of my head. 
\q1
\v 4 I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, 
\q1 And he answereth me out of his holy hill. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 5 I laid me down and slept; 
\q1 I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me. 
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people 
\q1 That have set themselves against me round about. 
\q1
\v 7 Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: 
\q1 For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; 
\q1 Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. 
\q1
\v 8 Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: 
\q1 Thy blessing be upon thy people. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\c 4  
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q1
\v 1 Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; 
\q1 Thou hast set me at large \add when I was\add* in distress: 
\q1 Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
\q1
\v 2 O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
\q1 \add How long\add* will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
\qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 3 But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly:
\q1 Jehovah will hear when I call unto him. 
\q1
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sin not: 
\q1 Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, 
\q1 And put your trust in Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 6 Many there are that say, Who will show us \add any\add* good?
\q1 Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, 
\q1 More than \add they have\add* when their grain and their new wine are increased.
\q1
\v 8 In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; 
\q1 For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety. 
\c 5  
\d For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. 
\b
\q1
\v 1 Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, 
\q1 Consider my meditation. 
\q1
\v 2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; 
\q1 For unto thee do I pray. 
\q1
\v 3 O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; 
\q1 In the morning will I order \add my prayer\add* unto thee, and will keep watch.
\q1
\v 4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: 
\q1 Evil shall not sojourn with thee. 
\q1
\v 5 The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: 
\q1 Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: 
\q1 Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man. 
\q1
\v 7 But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house:
\q1 In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 
\q1
\v 8 Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
\q1 Make thy way straight before my face. 
\q1
\v 9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; 
\q1 Their inward part is very wickedness; 
\q1 Their throat is an open sepulchre; 
\q1 They flatter with their tongue. 
\q1
\v 10 Hold them guilty, O God; 
\q1 Let them fall by their own counsels; 
\q1 Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; 
\q1 For they have rebelled against thee. 
\q1
\v 11 But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, 
\q1 Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: 
\q1 Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
\q1
\v 12 For thou wilt bless the righteous; 
\q1 O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.
\c 6  
\d For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q1
\v 1 O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, 
\q1 Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
\q1
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: 
\q1 O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled. 
\q1
\v 3 My soul also is sore troubled: 
\q1 And thou, O Jehovah, how long? 
\q1
\v 4 Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: 
\q1 Save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake. 
\q1
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: 
\q1 In Sheol who shall give thee thanks? 
\q1
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning; 
\q1 Every night make I my bed to swim; 
\q1 I water my couch with my tears. 
\q1
\v 7 Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; 
\q1 It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. 
\q1
\v 8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; 
\q1 For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
\q1
\v 9 Jehovah hath heard my supplication; 
\q1 Jehovah will receive my prayer. 
\q1
\v 10 All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: 
\q1 They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly. 
\c 7  
\d Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite.
\b
\q1
\v 1 O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: 
\q1 Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me, 
\q1
\v 2 Lest they tear my soul like a lion, 
\q1 Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 
\q1
\v 3 O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; 
\q1 If there be iniquity in my hands; 
\q1
\v 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me 
\q1 (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)
\q1
\v 5 Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; 
\q1 Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, 
\q1 And lay my glory in the dust. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 6 Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; 
\q1 Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, 
\q1 And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment. 
\q1
\v 7 And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about;
\q1 And over them return thou on high. 
\q1
\v 8 Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: 
\q1 Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.
\q1
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous:
\q1 For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts. 
\q1
\v 10 My shield is with God, 
\q1 Who saveth the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 11 God is a righteous judge, 
\q1 Yea, a God that hath indignation every day. 
\q1
\v 12 If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; 
\q1 He hath bent his bow, and made it ready; 
\q1
\v 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; 
\q1 He maketh his arrows fiery \add shafts\add*. 
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; 
\q1 Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
\q1
\v 15 He hath made a pit, and digged it, 
\q1 And is fallen into the ditch which he made. 
\q1
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, 
\q1 And his violence shall come down upon his own pate. 
\q1
\v 17 I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness,
\q1 And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High. 
\c 8  
\d For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q1
\v 1 O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth,
\q1 Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! 
\q1
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength,
\q1 Because of thine adversaries, 
\q1 That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 
\q1
\v 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, 
\q1 The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 
\q1
\v 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? 
\q1 And the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
\q1
\v 5 For thou hast made him but little lower than God, 
\q1 And crownest him with glory and honor. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
\q1 Thou hast put all things under his feet: 
\q1
\v 7 All sheep and oxen, 
\q1 Yea, and the beasts of the field, 
\q1
\v 8 The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, 
\q1 Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 
\q1
\v 9 O Jehovah, our Lord, 
\q1 How excellent is thy name in all the earth! 
\c 9  
\d For the Chief Musician; set to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.
\b
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; 
\q1 I will show forth all thy marvellous works. 
\q1
\v 2 I will be glad and exult in thee; 
\q1 I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. 
\q1
\v 3 When mine enemies turn back, 
\q1 They stumble and perish at thy presence. 
\q1
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; 
\q1 Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously. 
\q1
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked;
\q1 Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 6 The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; 
\q1 And the cities which thou hast overthrown, 
\q1 The very remembrance of them is perished. 
\q1
\v 7 But Jehovah sitteth \add as king\add* for ever: 
\q1 He hath prepared his throne for judgment; 
\q1
\v 8 And he will judge the world in righteousness, 
\q1 He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. 
\q1
\v 9 Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, 
\q1 A high tower in times of trouble; 
\q1
\v 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; 
\q1 For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. 
\q1
\v 11 Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: 
\q1 Declare among the people his doings. 
\q1
\v 12 For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them;
\q1 He forgetteth not the cry of the poor. 
\q1
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; 
\q1 Behold my affliction \add which I suffer\add* of them that hate me,
\q1 Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; 
\q1
\v 14 That I may show forth all thy praise. 
\q1 In the gates of the daughter of Zion 
\q1 I will rejoice in thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: 
\q1 In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 
\q1
\v 16 Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment:
\q1 The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. \qs [Higgaion.
Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, 
\q1 Even all the nations that forget God. 
\q1
\v 18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, 
\q1 Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. 
\q1
\v 19 Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: 
\q1 Let the nations be judged in thy sight. 
\q1
\v 20 Put them in fear, O Jehovah: 
\q1 Let the nations know themselves to be but men. \qs [Selah\qs*
\c 10  
\b
\q1
\v 1 Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? 
\q1 Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 
\q1
\v 2 In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; 
\q1 Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived. 
\q1
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, 
\q1 And the covetous renounceth, \add yea\add*, contemneth Jehovah.
\q1
\v 4 The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, \add saith\add*, He will not require
\add it\add*. 
\q1 All his thoughts are, There is no God. 
\q1
\v 5 His ways are firm at all times; 
\q1 Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: 
\q1 As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. 
\q1
\v 6 He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; 
\q1 To all generations I shall not be in adversity. 
\q1
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: 
\q1 Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. 
\q1
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; 
\q1 In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; 
\q1 His eyes are privily set against the helpless. 
\q1
\v 9 He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; 
\q1 He lieth in wait to catch the poor: 
\q1 He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net. 
\q1
\v 10 He croucheth, he boweth down, 
\q1 And the helpless fall by his strong ones. 
\q1
\v 11 He saith in his heart: God hath forgotten; 
\q1 He hideth his face, he will never see it. 
\q1
\v 12 Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: 
\q1 Forget not the poor. 
\q1
\v 13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, 
\q1 And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require \add it\add*? 
\q1
\v 14 Thou hast seen \add it\add*; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand:
\q1 The helpless committeth \add himself\add* unto thee; 
\q1 Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. 
\q1
\v 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked; 
\q1 And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
\q1
\v 16 Jehovah is King for ever and ever: 
\q1 The nations are perished out of his land. 
\q1
\v 17 Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: 
\q1 Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;
\q1
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, 
\q1 That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more. 
\c 11  
\d For the Chief Musician. \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 In Jehovah do I take refuge: 
\q1 How say ye to my soul, 
\q1 Flee \add as\add* a bird to your mountain; 
\q1
\v 2 For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, 
\q1 They make ready their arrow upon the string, 
\q1 That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart; 
\q1
\v 3 If the foundations be destroyed, 
\q1 What can the righteous do? 
\q1
\v 4 Jehovah is in his holy temple; 
\q1 Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; 
\q1 His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 
\q1
\v 5 Jehovah trieth the righteous; 
\q1 But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
\q1
\v 6 Upon the wicked he will rain snares; 
\q1 Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
\q1
\v 7 For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: 
\q1 The upright shall behold his face. 
\c 12  
\d For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
\q1
\v 1 Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth; 
\q1 For the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
\q1
\v 2 They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: 
\q1 With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
\q1
\v 3 Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, 
\q1 The tongue that speaketh great things; 
\q1
\v 4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; 
\q1 Our lips are our own: who is lord over us? 
\q1
\v 5 Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy,
\q1 Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; 
\q1 I will set him in the safety he panteth for. 
\q1
\v 6 The words of Jehovah are pure words; 
\q1 As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, 
\q1 Purified seven times. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, 
\q1 Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever. 
\q1
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side, 
\q1 When vileness is exalted among the sons of men. 
\c 13  
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? 
\q1 How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, 
\q1 Having sorrow in my heart all the day? 
\q1 How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 
\q1
\v 3 Consider \add and\add* answer me, O Jehovah my God: 
\q1 Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \add sleep of\add* death;
\q1
\v 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; 
\q1 \add Lest\add* mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved. 
\q1
\v 5 But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; 
\q1 My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 6 I will sing unto Jehovah, 
\q1 Because he hath dealt bountifully with me. 
\c 14  
\d For the Chief Musician. \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. 
\q1 They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; 
\q1 There is none that doeth good. 
\q1
\v 2 Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, 
\q1 To see if there were any that did understand, 
\q1 That did seek after God. 
\q1
\v 3 They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; 
\q1 There is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
\q1
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, 
\q1 Who eat up my people \add as\add* they eat bread, 
\q1 And call not upon Jehovah? 
\q1
\v 5 There were they in great fear; 
\q1 For God is in the generation of the righteous. 
\q1
\v 6 Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, 
\q1 Because Jehovah is his refuge. 
\q1
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! 
\q1 When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, 
\q1 Then shall Jacob rejoice, \add and\add* Israel shall be glad.
\c 15  
\d A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? 
\q1 Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
\q1
\v 2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, 
\q1 And speaketh truth in his heart; 
\q1
\v 3 He that slandereth not with his tongue, 
\q1 Nor doeth evil to his friend, 
\q1 Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor; 
\q1
\v 4 In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, 
\q1 But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; 
\q1 He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; 
\q1
\v 5 He that putteth not out his money to interest, 
\q1 Nor taketh reward against the innocent. 
\q1 He that doeth these things shall never be moved. 
\c 16  
\d Michtam of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Preserve me, O God; for in thee do I take refuge. 
\q1
\v 2  \add O my soul\add*, thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord:
\q1 I have no good beyond thee. 
\q1
\v 3 As for the saints that are in the earth, 
\q1 They are the excellent in whom is all my delight. 
\q1
\v 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another
\add god\add*: 
\q1 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, 
\q1 Nor take their names upon my lips. 
\q1
\v 5 Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: 
\q1 Thou maintainest my lot. 
\q1
\v 6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; 
\q1 Yea, I have a goodly heritage. 
\q1
\v 7 I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; 
\q1 Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons. 
\q1
\v 8 I have set Jehovah always before me: 
\q1 Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
\q1
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: 
\q1 My flesh also shall dwell in safety. 
\q1
\v 10 For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; 
\q1 Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou wilt show me the path of life: 
\q1 In thy presence is fulness of joy; 
\q1 In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. 
\c 17  
\d A Prayer of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; 
\q1 Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
\q1
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; 
\q1 Let thine eyes look upon equity. 
\q1
\v 3 Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
\q1 Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; 
\q1 I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 
\q1
\v 4 As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips 
\q1 I have kept me from the ways of the violent. 
\q1
\v 5 My steps have held fast to thy paths, 
\q1 My feet have not slipped. 
\q1
\v 6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: 
\q1 Incline thine ear unto me, \add and\add* hear my speech. 
\q1
\v 7 Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, 
\q1 O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge \add in thee
\add* 
\q1 From those that rise up \add against them\add*. 
\q1
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye; 
\q1 Hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 
\q1
\v 9 From the wicked that oppress me, 
\q1 My deadly enemies, that compass me about. 
\q1
\v 10 They are inclosed in their own fat: 
\q1 With their mouth they speak proudly. 
\q1
\v 11 They have now compassed us in our steps; 
\q1 They set their eyes to cast \add us\add* down to the earth. 
\q1
\v 12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, 
\q1 And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 
\q1
\v 13 Arise, O Jehovah, 
\q1 Confront him, cast him down: 
\q1 Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; 
\q1
\v 14 From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, 
\q1 From men of the world, whose portion is in \add this\add* life,
\q1 And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: 
\q1 They are satisfied with children, 
\q1 And leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 
\q1
\v 15 As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; 
\q1 I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with \add beholding\add* thy form.
\c 18  
\d For the Chief Musician. \add A Psalm\add* of David the servant of Jehovah, who spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in
the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said,
\q1
\v 1 I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength. 
\q1
\v 2 Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 
\q1 My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; 
\q1 My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. 
\q1
\v 3 I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: 
\q1 So shall I be saved from mine enemies. 
\q1
\v 4 The cords of death compassed me, 
\q1 And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid. 
\q1
\v 5 The cords of Sheol were round about me; 
\q1 The snares of death came upon me. 
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called upon Jehovah, 
\q1 And cried unto my God: 
\q1 He heard my voice out of his temple, 
\q1 And my cry before him came into his ears. 
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; 
\q1 The foundations also of the mountains quaked 
\q1 And were shaken, because he was wroth. 
\q1
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, 
\q1 And fire out of his mouth devoured: 
\q1 Coals were kindled by it. 
\q1
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; 
\q1 And thick darkness was under his feet. 
\q1
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; 
\q1 Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind. 
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him,
\q1 Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. 
\q1
\v 12 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, 
\q1 Hailstones and coals of fire. 
\q1
\v 13 Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, 
\q1 And the Most High uttered his voice, 
\q1 Hailstones and coals of fire. 
\q1
\v 14 And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; 
\q1 Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them. 
\q1
\v 15 Then the channels of waters appeared, 
\q1 And the foundations of the world were laid bare, 
\q1 At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, 
\q1 At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
\q1
\v 16 He sent from on high, he took me; 
\q1 He drew me out of many waters. 
\q1
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, 
\q1 And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
\q1
\v 18 They came upon me in the day of my calamity; 
\q1 But Jehovah was my stay. 
\q1
\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place; 
\q1 He delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
\q1
\v 20 Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; 
\q1 According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\q1
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, 
\q1 And have not wickedly departed from my God. 
\q1
\v 22 For all his ordinances were before me, 
\q1 And I put not away his statutes from me. 
\q1
\v 23 I was also perfect with him, 
\q1 And I kept myself from mine iniquity. 
\q1
\v 24 Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,
\q1 According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. 
\q1
\v 25 With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; 
\q1 With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect; 
\q1
\v 26 With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; 
\q1 And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward. 
\q1
\v 27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; 
\q1 But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down. 
\q1
\v 28 For thou wilt light my lamp: 
\q1 Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness. 
\q1
\v 29 For by thee I run upon a troop; 
\q1 And by my God do I leap over a wall. 
\q1
\v 30 As for God, his way is perfect: 
\q1 The word of Jehovah is tried; 
\q1 He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him. 
\q1
\v 31 For who is God, save Jehovah? 
\q1 And who is a rock, besides our God, 
\q1
\v 32 The God that girdeth me with strength, 
\q1 And maketh my way perfect? 
\q1
\v 33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ \add feet\add*: 
\q1 And setteth me upon my high places. 
\q1
\v 34 He teacheth my hands to war; 
\q1 So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass. 
\q1
\v 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; 
\q1 And thy right hand hath holden me up, 
\q1 And thy gentleness hath made me great. 
\q1
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, 
\q1 And my feet have not slipped. 
\q1
\v 37 I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; 
\q1 Neither will I turn again till they are consumed. 
\q1
\v 38 I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise:
\q1 They shall fall under my feet. 
\q1
\v 39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: 
\q1 Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
\q1
\v 40 Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,
\q1 That I might cut off them that hate me. 
\q1
\v 41 They cried, but there was none to save; 
\q1 Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not. 
\q1
\v 42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; 
\q1 I did cast them out as the mire of the streets. 
\q1
\v 43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; 
\q1 Thou hast made me the head of the nations: 
\q1 A people whom I have not known shall serve me. 
\q1
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; 
\q1 The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me. 
\q1
\v 45 The foreigners shall fade away, 
\q1 And shall come trembling out of their close places. 
\q1
\v 46 Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; 
\q1 And exalted be the God of my salvation, 
\q1
\v 47 Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, 
\q1 And subdueth peoples under me. 
\q1
\v 48 He rescueth me from mine enemies; 
\q1 Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; 
\q1 Thou deliverest me from the violent man. 
\q1
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,
\q1 And will sing praises unto thy name. 
\q1
\v 50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king, 
\q1 And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, 
\q1 To David and to his seed, for evermore.

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 The heavens declare the glory of God; 
\q1 And the firmament showeth his handiwork. 
\q1
\v 2 Day unto day uttereth speech, 
\q1 And night unto night showeth knowledge. 
\q1
\v 3 There is no speech nor language; 
\q1 Their voice is not heard. 
\q1
\v 4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, 
\q1 And their words to the end of the world. 
\q1 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 
\q1
\v 5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, 
\q1 And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. 
\q1
\v 6 His going forth is from the end of the heavens, 
\q1 And his circuit unto the ends of it; 
\q1 And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: 
\q1 The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple. 
\q1
\v 8 The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: 
\q1 The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
\q1
\v 9 The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: 
\q1 The ordinances of Jehovah are true, \add and\add* righteous altogether.
\q1
\v 10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;
\q1 Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. 
\q1
\v 11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: 
\q1 In keeping them there is great reward. 
\q1
\v 12 Who can discern \add his\add* errors? 
\q1 Clear thou me from hidden \add faults\add*. 
\q1
\v 13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous \add sins\add*;
\q1 Let them not have dominion over me: 
\q1 Then shall I be upright, 
\q1 And I shall be clear from great transgression.

\v 1 Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; 
\q1 The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; 
\q1
\v 2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, 
\q1 And strengthen thee out of Zion;

\v 3 Remember all thy offerings, 
\q1 And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; \qs [Selah\qs*

\v 4 Grant thee thy heart’s desire,

\v 5 We will triumph in thy salvation,

\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; 
\q1 And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 
\q1
\v 2 Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, 
\q1 And hast not withholden the request of his lips. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 3 For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: 
\q1 Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. 
\q1
\v 4 He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, 
\q1 Even length of days for ever and ever. 
\q1
\v 5 His glory is great in thy salvation: 
\q1 Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him. 
\q1
\v 6 For thou makest him most blessed for ever: 
\q1 Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence. 
\q1
\v 7 For the king trusteth in Jehovah; 
\q1 And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
\q1
\v 8 Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; 
\q1 Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger:
\q1 Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, 
\q1 And the fire shall devour them. 
\q1
\v 10 Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, 
\q1 And their seed from among the children of men. 
\q1
\v 11 For they intended evil against thee; 
\q1 They conceived a device which they are not able to perform. 
\q1
\v 12 For thou wilt make them turn their back; 
\q1 Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.

\v 13 Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: 
\q1 So will we sing and praise thy power.

\q1
\v 3 But thou art holy, 
\q1 O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 
\q1
\v 4 Our fathers trusted in thee: 
\q1 They trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
\q1
\v 5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: 
\q1 They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame. 
\q1
\v 6 But I am a worm, and no man;

\v 8 Commit \add thyself\add* unto Jehovah; 
\q1 let him deliver him: 
\q1 Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.

\v 9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb;

\q1

\q1
\v 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; 
\q1 And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws;

\q1 They look and stare upon me;

\v 19 But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: 
\q1 O thou my succor, haste thee to help me. 
\q1
\v 20 Deliver my soul from the sword,

\v 21 Save me from the lion’s mouth;

\v 23 Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him;

\q1 Neither hath he hid his face from him; 
\q1 But when he cried unto him, he heard. 
\q1
\v 25 Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: 
\q1 I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, 
\q1 When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. 
\q1
\v 3 Draw me not away with the wicked, 
\q1 And with the workers of iniquity; 
\q1 That speak peace with their neighbors, 
\q1 But mischief is in their hearts. 
\q1
\v 4 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:
\q1 Give them after the operation of their hands; 
\q1 Render to them their desert. 
\q1
\v 5 Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, 
\q1 Nor the operation of his hands, 
\q1 He will break them down and not build them up.

\v 6 Blessed be Jehovah, 
\q1 Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
\q1
\v 7 Jehovah is my strength and my shield;

\v 4 The voice of Jehovah is powerful; 
\q1 The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty. 
\q1
\v 5 The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; 
\q1 Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 
\q1
\v 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; 
\q1 Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.

\q1 And in his temple everything saith, Glory.

\q1
\v 2 O Jehovah my God, 
\q1 I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 
\q1
\v 3 O Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; 
\q1 Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
\q1
\v 4 Sing praise unto Jehovah, O ye saints of his, 
\q1 And give thanks to his holy memorial \add name\add*.

\v 5 For his anger is but for a moment;

\q1
\v 6 As for me, I said in my prosperity, 
\q1 I shall never be moved. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong:
\q1 Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled. 
\q1
\v 8 I cried to thee, O Jehovah; 
\q1 And unto Jehovah I made supplication: 
\q1
\v 9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
\q1 Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 
\q1
\v 10 Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me:

\q1
\v 11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing;

\v 2 Bow down thine ear unto me; deliver me speedily:

\v 3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; 
\q1 Therefore for thy name’s sake lead me and guide me. 
\q1
\v 4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me;

\q1
\v 5 Into thy hand I commend my spirit:

\q1
\v 6 I hate them that regard lying vanities; 
\q1 But I trust in Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy lovingkindness; 
\q1 For thou hast seen my affliction: 
\q1 Thou hast known my soul in adversities; 
\q1
\v 8 And thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; 
\q1 Thou hast set my feet in a large place. 
\q1
\v 9 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress: 
\q1 Mine eye wasteth away with grief, \add yea\add*, my soul and my body.
\q1
\v 10 For my life is spent with sorrow, 
\q1 And my years with sighing: 
\q1 My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, 
\q1 And my bones are wasted away. 
\q1
\v 11 Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, 
\q1 Yea, unto my neighbors exceedingly, 
\q1 And a fear to mine acquaintance: 
\q1 They that did see me without fled from me. 
\q1
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: 
\q1 I am like a broken vessel. 
\q1
\v 13 For I have heard the defaming of many, 
\q1 Terror on every side: 
\q1 While they took counsel together against me, 
\q1 They devised to take away my life. 
\q1
\v 14 But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah: 
\q1 I said, Thou art my God. 
\q1
\v 15 My times are in thy hand: 
\q1 Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
\q1
\v 16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: 
\q1 Save me in thy lovingkindness. 
\q1
\v 17 Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah; for I have called upon thee:
\q1 Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.
\q1
\v 18 Let the lying lips be dumb, 
\q1 Which speak against the righteous insolently, 
\q1 With pride and contempt.

\q1 Which thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in thee, 
\q1 Before the sons of men! 
\q1
\v 20 In the covert of thy presence wilt thou hide them from the plottings of man:
\q1 Thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
\q1
\v 21 Blessed be Jehovah; 
\q1 For he hath showed me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city.
\q1
\v 22 As for me, I said in my haste, 
\q1 I am cut off from before thine eyes: 
\q1 Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications, 
\q1 When I cried unto thee. 
\q1
\v 23 Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints: 
\q1 Jehovah preserveth the faithful, 
\q1 And plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly.

\q1
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away

\v 36 But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: 
\q1 Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.

\v 37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; 
\q1 For there is a \add happy\add* end to the man of peace. 
\q1
\v 38 As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together:

\q1
\v 39 But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: 
\q1 He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. 
\q1
\v 40 And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them: 
\q1 He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, 
\q1 Because they have taken refuge in him. 
\c 38  
\d A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. 
\q1
\v 1 O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; 
\q1 Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
\q1
\v 2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, 
\q1 And thy hand presseth me sore. 
\q1
\v 3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation;
\q1 Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. 
\q1
\v 4 For mine iniquities are gone over my head: 
\q1 As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
\q1
\v 5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, 
\q1 Because of my foolishness. 
\q1
\v 6 I am pained and bowed down greatly; 
\q1 I go mourning all the day long. 
\q1
\v 7 For my loins are filled with burning; 
\q1 And there is no soundness in my flesh. 
\q1
\v 8 I am faint and sore bruised: 
\q1 I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
\q1
\v 9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; 
\q1 And my groaning is not hid from thee. 
\q1
\v 10 My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: 
\q1 As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 
\q1
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; 
\q1 And my kinsmen stand afar off. 
\q1
\v 12 They also that seek after my life lay snares \add for me\add*;
\q1 And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, 
\q1 And meditate deceits all the day long. 
\q1
\v 13 But I, as a deaf man, hear not; 
\q1 And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
\q1
\v 14 Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, 
\q1 And in whose mouth are no reproofs. 
\q1
\v 15 For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: 
\q1 Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 
\q1
\v 16 For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: 
\q1 When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 
\q1
\v 17 For I am ready to fall, 
\q1 And my sorrow is continually before me. 
\q1
\v 18 For I will declare mine iniquity; 
\q1 I will be sorry for my sin. 
\q1
\v 19 But mine enemies are lively, \add and\add* are strong; 
\q1 And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
\q1
\v 20 They also that render evil for good 
\q1 Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.
\q1
\v 21 Forsake me not, O Jehovah: 
\q1 O my God, be not far from me. 
\q1
\v 22 Make haste to help me, 
\q1 O Lord, my salvation. 
\c 39  
\d For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, 
\q1 That I sin not with my tongue: 
\q1 I will keep my mouth with a bridle, 
\q1 While the wicked is before me. 
\q1
\v 2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; 
\q1 And my sorrow was stirred. 
\q1
\v 3 My heart was hot within me; 
\q1 While I was musing the fire burned; 
\q1 \add Then\add* spake I with my tongue: 
\q1
\v 4 Jehovah, make me to know mine end, 
\q1 And the measure of my days, what it is; 
\q1 Let me know how frail I am. 
\q1
\v 5 Behold, thou hast made my days \add as\add* handbreadths; 
\q1 And my life-time is as nothing before thee: 
\q1 Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 6 Surely every man walketh in a vain show; 
\q1 Surely they are disquieted in vain: 
\q1 He heapeth up \add riches\add*, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
\q1
\v 7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? 
\q1 My hope is in thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: 
\q1 Make me not the reproach of the foolish. 
\q1
\v 9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; 
\q1 Because thou didst it. 
\q1
\v 10 Remove thy stroke away from me: 
\q1 I am consumed by the blow of thy hand. 
\q1
\v 11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, 
\q1 Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: 
\q1 Surely every man is vanity. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; 
\q1 Hold not thy peace at my tears: 
\q1 For I am a stranger with thee, 
\q1 A sojourner, as all my fathers were. 
\q1
\v 13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, 
\q1 Before I go hence, and be no more. 
\c 40  
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 I waited patiently for Jehovah; 
\q1 And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 
\q1
\v 2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay;
\q1 And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. 
\q1
\v 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
\q1 Many shall see it, and fear, 
\q1 And shall trust in Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 4 Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust, 
\q1 And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
\q1
\v 5 Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done,
\q1 And thy thoughts which are to us-ward: 
\q1 They cannot be set in order unto thee; 
\q1 If I would declare and speak of them, 
\q1 They are more than can be numbered. 
\q1
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; 
\q1 Mine ears hast thou opened: 
\q1 Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. 
\q1
\v 7 Then said I, Lo, I am come; 
\q1 In the roll of the book it is written of me: 
\q1
\v 8 I delight to do thy will, O my God; 
\q1 Yea, thy law is within my heart. 
\q1
\v 9 I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly;
\q1 Lo, I will not refrain my lips, 
\q1 O Jehovah, thou knowest. 
\q1
\v 10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; 
\q1 I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; 
\q1 I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.
\q1
\v 11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; 
\q1 Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
\q1
\v 12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about; 
\q1 Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;
\q1 They are more than the hairs of my head; 
\q1 And my heart hath failed me. 
\q1
\v 13 Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: 
\q1 Make haste to help me, O Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 14 Let them be put to shame and confounded together 
\q1 That seek after my soul to destroy it: 
\q1 Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor 
\q1 That delight in my hurt. 
\q1
\v 15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame 
\q1 That say unto me, Aha, aha. 
\q1
\v 16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: 
\q1 Let such as love thy salvation say continually, 
\q1 Jehovah be magnified. 
\q1
\v 17 But I am poor and needy; 
\q1 \add Yet\add* the Lord thinketh upon me: 
\q1 Thou art my help and my deliverer; 
\q1 Make no tarrying, O my God. 
\c 41  
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor:

\q1
\v 2 Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, 
\q1 And he shall be blessed upon the earth; 
\q1 And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. 
\q1
\v 3 Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing: 
\q1 Thou makest all his bed in his sickness. 
\q1
\v 4 I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me: 
\q1 Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 
\q1
\v 5 Mine enemies speak evil against me, \add saying\add*, 
\q1 When will he die, and his name perish? 
\q1
\v 6 And if he come to see \add me\add*, he speaketh falsehood; 
\q1 His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: 
\q1 When he goeth abroad, he telleth it. 
\q1
\v 7 All that hate me whisper together against me; 
\q1 Against me do they devise my hurt. 
\q1
\v 8 An evil disease, \add say they\add*, cleaveth fast unto him;
\q1 And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. 
\q1
\v 9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, 
\q1 Who did eat of my bread, 
\q1 Hath lifted up his heel against me. 
\q1
\v 10 But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, 
\q1 That I may requite them. 
\q1
\v 11 By this I know that thou delightest in me, 
\q1 Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 
\q1
\v 12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, 
\q1 And settest me before thy face for ever.

\v 1 We have heard with our ears, O God,

\q1 What work thou didst in their days, 
\q1 In the days of old. 
\q1
\v 2 Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; 
\q1 But them thou didst plant: 
\q1 Thou didst afflict the peoples; 
\q1 But them thou didst spread abroad. 
\q1
\v 3 For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword,
\q1 Neither did their own arm save them; 
\q1 But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
\q1 Because thou wast favorable unto them. 
\q1
\v 4 Thou art my King, O God: 
\q1 Command deliverance for Jacob. 
\q1
\v 5 Through thee will we push down our adversaries: 
\q1 Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
\q1
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, 
\q1 Neither shall my sword save me. 
\q1
\v 7 But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, 
\q1 And hast put them to shame that hate us. 
\q1
\v 8 In God have we made our boast all the day long, 
\q1 And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. \qs [Selah\qs*

\v 9 But now thou hast cast \add us\add* off, and brought us to dishonor,
\q1 And goest not forth with our hosts. 
\q1
\v 10 Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; 
\q1 And they that hate us take spoil for themselves. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou hast made us like sheep \add appointed\add* for food,
\q1 And hast scattered us among the nations. 
\q1
\v 12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, 
\q1 And hast not increased \add thy wealth\add* by their price. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, 
\q1 A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us. 
\q1
\v 14 Thou makest us a byword among the nations, 
\q1 A shaking of the head among the peoples. 
\q1
\v 15 All the day long is my dishonor before me, 
\q1 And the shame of my face hath covered me, 
\q1
\v 16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, 
\q1 By reason of the enemy and the avenger. 
\q1
\v 17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, 
\q1 Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 
\q1
\v 18 Our heart is not turned back, 
\q1 Neither have our steps declined from thy way,

\q1 And covered us with the shadow of death. 
\q1
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, 
\q1 Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;

\v 21 Will not God search this out?

\q1
\v 14 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; 
\q1 Death shall be their shepherd: 
\q1 And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
\q1 And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume,

\v 18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul 
\q1 (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself),

\d A Psalm of Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, 
\q1 And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
\q1
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, 
\q1 God hath shined forth. 
\q1
\v 3 Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: 
\q1 A fire devoureth before him, 
\q1 And it is very tempestuous round about him. 
\q1
\v 4 He calleth to the heavens above, 
\q1 And to the earth, that he may judge his people: 
\q1
\v 5 Gather my saints together unto me, 
\q1 Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 
\q1
\v 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; 
\q1 For God is judge himself. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; 
\q1 O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: 
\q1 I am God, \add even\add* thy God. 
\q1
\v 8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; 
\q1 And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me. 
\q1
\v 9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, 
\q1 Nor he-goats out of thy folds. 
\q1
\v 10 For every beast of the forest is mine, 
\q1 And the cattle upon a thousand hills. 
\q1
\v 11 I know all the birds of the mountains; 
\q1 And the wild beasts of the field are mine. 
\q1
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; 
\q1 For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. 
\q1
\v 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, 
\q1 Or drink the blood of goats? 
\q1
\v 14 Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; 
\q1 And pay thy vows unto the Most High; 
\q1
\v 15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: 
\q1 I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 But unto the wicked God saith, 
\q1 What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, 
\q1 And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth, 
\q1
\v 17 Seeing that thou hatest instruction, 
\q1 And castest my words behind thee? 
\q1
\v 18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, 
\q1 And hast been partaker with adulterers. 
\q1
\v 19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, 
\q1 And thy tongue frameth deceit. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; 
\q1 Thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. 
\q1
\v 21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; 
\q1 Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself:
\q1 \add But\add* I will reprove thee, and set \add them\add* in order before thine eyes.
\b
\q1
\v 22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, 
\q1 Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:

\q1
\v 1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
\q1 According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
\q1
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, 
\q1 And cleanse me from my sin. 
\q1
\v 3 For I know my transgressions; 
\q1 And my sin is ever before me. 
\q1
\v 4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, 
\q1 And done that which is evil in thy sight; 
\q1 That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, 
\q1 And be clear when thou judgest. 
\q1
\v 5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; 
\q1 And in sin did my mother conceive me. 
\q1
\v 6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts; 
\q1 And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom. 
\q1
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: 
\q1 Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
\q1
\v 8 Make me to hear joy and gladness, 
\q1 That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 
\q1
\v 9 Hide thy face from my sins, 
\q1 And blot out all mine iniquities. 
\q1
\v 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; 
\q1 And renew a right spirit within me. 
\q1
\v 11 Cast me not away from thy presence; 
\q1 And take not thy holy Spirit from me. 
\q1
\v 12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; 
\q1 And uphold me with a willing spirit. 
\q1
\v 13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; 
\q1 And sinners shall be converted unto thee. 
\q1
\v 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation;
\q1 \add And\add* my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
\q1
\v 15 O Lord, open thou my lips; 
\q1 And my mouth shall show forth thy praise. 
\q1
\v 16 For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it:
\q1 Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering. 
\q1
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: 
\q1 A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: 
\q1 Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
\q1
\v 19 Then wilt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
\q1 In burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: 
\q1 Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

\v 2 Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness,

\q1
\v 4 Thou lovest all devouring words,

\v 7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength,

\q1
\v 8 But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God:
\q1 I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.

\q1
\v 1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. 
\q1 Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; 
\q1 There is none that doeth good. 
\q1
\v 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, 
\q1 To see if there were any that did understand, 
\q1 That did seek after God. 
\q1
\v 3 Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy;
\q1 There is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
\q1
\v 4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, 
\q1 Who eat up my people \add as\add* they eat bread, 
\q1 And call not upon God? 
\q1
\v 5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was; 
\q1 For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
\q1 Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them.
\q1
\v 6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!

\v 2 Attend unto me, and answer me: 
\q1 I am restless in my complaint, and moan,

\v 3 Because of the voice of the enemy,

\v 10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:

\q1
\v 11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: 
\q1 Oppression and guile depart not from its streets. 
\q1
\v 12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me;

\q1 Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
\q1 Then I would have hid myself from him:

\v 20 He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him:

\q1 That ye may slay \add him\add*, all of you, 
\q1 Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? 
\q1
\v 4 They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; 
\q1 They delight in lies; 
\q1 They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 5 My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; 
\q1 For my expectation is from him. 
\q1
\v 6 He only is my rock and my salvation: 
\q1 \add He is\add* my high tower; I shall not be moved. 
\q1
\v 7 With God is my salvation and my glory: 
\q1 The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 
\q1
\v 8 Trust in him at all times, ye people; 
\q1 Pour out your heart before him: 
\q1 God is a refuge for us. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie:
\q1 In the balances they will go up; 
\q1 They are together lighter than vanity.

\v 10 Trust not in oppression, 
\q1 And become not vain in robbery: 
\q1 If riches increase, set not your heart \add thereon\add*.

\v 11 God hath spoken once, 
\q1 Twice have I heard this, 
\q1 That power belongeth unto God. 
\q1
\v 12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; 
\q1 For thou renderest to every man according to his work. 
\c 63  
\d A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. 
\q1
\v 1 O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: 
\q1 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, 
\q1 In a dry and weary land, where no water is. 
\q1
\v 2 So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, 
\q1 To see thy power and thy glory. 
\q1
\v 3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, 
\q1 My lips shall praise thee. 
\q1
\v 4 So will I bless thee while I live: 
\q1 I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
\q1
\v 5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; 
\q1 And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips; 
\q1
\v 6 When I remember thee upon my bed, 
\q1 \add And\add* meditate on thee in the night-watches. 
\q1
\v 7 For thou hast been my help, 
\q1 And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 
\q1
\v 8 My soul followeth hard after thee: 
\q1 Thy right hand upholdeth me. 
\q1
\v 9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, 
\q1 Shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 
\q1
\v 10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword: 
\q1 They shall be a portion for foxes. 
\q1
\v 11 But the king shall rejoice in God: 
\q1 Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; 
\q1 For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. 
\c 64  
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: 
\q1 Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
\q1
\v 2 Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, 
\q1 From the tumult of the workers of iniquity; 
\q1
\v 3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, 
\q1 And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words, 
\q1
\v 4 That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: 
\q1 Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
\q1
\v 5 They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; 
\q1 They commune of laying snares privily; 
\q1 They say, Who will see them? 
\q1
\v 6 They search out iniquities; 
\q1 We have accomplished, \add say they\add*, a diligent search:
\q1 And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep. 
\q1
\v 7 But God will shoot at them; 
\q1 With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded. 
\q1
\v 8 So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them:
\q1 All that see them shall wag the head. 
\q1
\v 9 And all men shall fear; 
\q1 And they shall declare the work of God, 
\q1 And shall wisely consider of his doing. 
\q1
\v 10 The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him;
\q1 And all the upright in heart shall glory. 
\c 65  
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A song of David.

\v 1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion; 
\q1 And unto thee shall the vow be performed. 
\q1
\v 2 O thou that hearest prayer, 
\q1 Unto thee shall all flesh come. 
\q1
\v 3 Iniquities prevail against me: 
\q1 As for our transgressions, thou wilt forgive them. 
\q1
\v 4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
\add unto thee\add*, 
\q1 That he may dwell in thy courts: 
\q1 We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, 
\q1 Thy holy temple. 
\q1
\v 5 By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness, 
\q1 Oh God of our salvation, 
\q1 Thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, 
\q1 And of them that are afar off upon the sea: 
\q1
\v 6 Who by his strength setteth fast the mountains, 
\q1 Being girded about with might; 
\q1
\v 7 Who stilleth the roaring of the seas, 
\q1 The roaring of their waves, 
\q1 And the tumult of the peoples. 
\q1
\v 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens:
\q1 Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
\q1
\v 9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it, 
\q1 Thou greatly enrichest it; 
\q1 The river of God is full of water: 
\q1 Thou providest them grain, when thou hast so prepared the earth.
\q1
\v 10 Thou waterest its furrows abundantly; 
\q1 Thou settlest the ridges thereof: 
\q1 Thou makest it soft with showers; 
\q1 Thou blessest the springing thereof. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; 
\q1 And thy paths drop fatness. 
\q1
\v 12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; 
\q1 And the hills are girded with joy. 
\q1
\v 13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; 
\q1 The valleys also are covered over with grain; 
\q1 They shout for joy, they also sing.

\q1
\v 3 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! 
\q1 Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
\q1
\v 4 All the earth shall worship thee,

\q1 They shall sing to thy name. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 5 Come, and see the works of God; 
\q1 \add He is\add* terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
\q1
\v 6 He turned the sea into dry land; 
\q1 They went through the river on foot: 
\q1 There did we rejoice in him. 
\q1
\v 7 He ruleth by his might for ever; 
\q1 His eyes observe the nations: 
\q1 Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 8 Oh bless our God, ye peoples, 
\q1 And make the voice of his praise to be heard; 
\q1
\v 9 Who holdeth our soul in life, 
\q1 And suffereth not our feet to be moved. 
\q1
\v 10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: 
\q1 Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 
\q1
\v 11 Thou broughtest us into the net; 
\q1 Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins. 
\q1
\v 12 Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; 
\q1 We went through fire and through water; 
\q1 But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. 
\q1
\v 13 I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; 
\q1 I will pay thee my vows, 
\q1
\v 14 Which my lips uttered, 
\q1 And my mouth spake, when I was in distress. 
\q1
\v 15 I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, 
\q1 With the incense of rams; 
\q1 I will offer bullocks with goats. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 16 Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, 
\q1 And I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 
\q1
\v 17 I cried unto him with my mouth, 
\q1 And he was extolled with my tongue. 
\q1
\v 18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, 
\q1 The Lord will not hear: 
\q1
\v 19 But verily God hath heard; 
\q1 He hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 
\q1
\v 20 Blessed be God, 
\q1 Who hath not turned away my prayer, 
\q1 Nor his lovingkindness from me.

\v 2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away:

\q1
\v 10 Thy congregation dwelt therein: 
\q1 Thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor. 
\q1
\v 11 The Lord giveth the word: 
\q1 The women that publish the tidings are a great host. 
\q1
\v 12 Kings of armies flee, they flee;

\q1

\v 1 Save me, O God;

\q1
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: 
\q1 I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 
\q1
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: 
\q1 Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
\q1
\v 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:
\q1 They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
\q1 That which I took not away I have to restore. 
\q1
\v 5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; 
\q1 And my sins are not hid from thee. 
\q1
\v 6 Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts:
\q1 Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
\q1
\v 7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; 
\q1 Shame hath covered my face. 
\q1
\v 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, 
\q1 And an alien unto my mother’s children. 
\q1
\v 9 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; 
\q1 And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.
\q1
\v 10 When I wept, \add and chastened\add* my soul with fasting,
\q1 That was to my reproach. 
\q1
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, 
\q1 I became a byword unto them. 
\q1
\v 12 They that sit in the gate talk of me; 
\q1 And \add I am\add* the song of the drunkards. 
\q1
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time:
\q1 O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, 
\q1 Answer me in the truth of thy salvation. 
\q1
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: 
\q1 Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

\v 15 Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, 
\q1 Neither let the deep swallow me up; 
\q1 And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me. 
\q1
\v 16 Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: 
\q1 According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.
\q1
\v 17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; 
\q1 For I am in distress; answer me speedily. 
\q1
\v 18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: 
\q1 Ransom me because of mine enemies. 
\q1
\v 19 Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: 
\q1 Mine adversaries are all before thee. 
\q1
\v 20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:
\q1 And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; 
\q1 And for comforters, but I found none. 
\q1
\v 21 They gave me also gall for my food; 
\q1 And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
\q1
\v 22 Let their table before them become a snare; 
\q1 And when they are in peace, \add let it become\add* a trap. 
\q1
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; 
\q1 And make their loins continually to shake. 
\q1
\v 24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, 
\q1 And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them. 
\q1
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate; 
\q1 Let none dwell in their tents. 
\q1
\v 26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; 
\q1 And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
\q1
\v 27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity; 
\q1 And let them not come into thy righteousness. 
\q1
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life,

\q1
\v 29 But I am poor and sorrowful: 
\q1 Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
\q1
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song,

\q1
\v 31 And it will please Jehovah better than an ox,

\q1
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,

\q1
\v 9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him;

\v 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute:
\q1 The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 
\q1
\v 11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; 
\q1 All nations shall serve him. 
\q1
\v 12 For he will deliver the needy when he crieth, 
\q1 And the poor, that hath no helper. 
\q1
\v 13 He will have pity on the poor and needy, 
\q1 And the souls of the needy he will save. 
\q1
\v 14 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence; 
\q1 And precious will their blood be in his sight: 
\q1
\v 15 And they shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
\q1 And men shall pray for him continually; 
\q1 They shall bless him all the day long. 
\q1
\v 16 There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains;
\q1 The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: 
\q1 And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
\q1
\v 17 His name shall endure for ever; 
\q1 His name shall be continued as long as the sun: 
\q1 And men shall be blessed in him; 
\q1 All nations shall call him happy.

\q1
\v 18 Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, 
\q1 Who only doeth wondrous things: 
\q1
\v 19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever; 
\q1 And let the whole earth be filled with his glory.

\d A Psalm of Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 Surely God is good to Israel, 
\q1 \add Even\add* to such as are pure in heart. 
\q1
\v 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; 
\q1 My steps had well nigh slipped. 
\q1
\v 3 For I was envious at the arrogant, 
\q1 When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
\q1
\v 4 For there are no pangs in their death; 
\q1 But their strength is firm. 
\q1
\v 5 They are not in trouble as \add other\add* men; 
\q1 Neither are they plagued like \add other\add* men. 
\q1
\v 6 Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; 
\q1 Violence covereth them as a garment. 
\q1
\v 7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: 
\q1 They have more than heart could wish. 
\q1
\v 8 They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: 
\q1 They speak loftily. 
\q1
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens, 
\q1 And their tongue walketh through the earth. 
\q1
\v 10 Therefore his people return hither: 
\q1 And waters of a full \add cup\add* are drained by them. 
\q1
\v 11 And they say, How doth God know? 
\q1 And is there knowledge in the Most High? 
\q1
\v 12 Behold, these are the wicked; 
\q1 And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches. 
\q1
\v 13 Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, 
\q1 And washed my hands in innocency; 
\q1
\v 14 For all the day long have I been plagued, 
\q1 And chastened every morning. 
\q1
\v 15 If I had said, I will speak thus; 
\q1 Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
\q1
\v 16 When I thought how I might know this, 
\q1 It was too painful for me; 
\q1
\v 17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God, 
\q1 And considered their latter end. 
\q1
\v 18 Surely thou settest them in slippery places: 
\q1 Thou castest them down to destruction. 
\q1
\v 19 How are they become a desolation in a moment! 
\q1 They are utterly consumed with terrors. 
\q1
\v 20 As a dream when one awaketh, 
\q1 So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
\q1
\v 21 For my soul was grieved, 
\q1 And I was pricked in my heart: 
\q1
\v 22 So brutish was I, and ignorant; 
\q1 I was \add as\add* a beast before thee. 
\q1
\v 23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: 
\q1 Thou hast holden my right hand. 
\q1
\v 24 Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, 
\q1 And afterward receive me to glory. 
\q1
\v 25 Whom have I in heaven \add but thee\add*? 
\q1 And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. 
\q1
\v 26 My flesh and my heart faileth; 
\q1 \add But\add* God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
\q1
\v 27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: 
\q1 Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, \add departing
\add* from thee. 
\q1
\v 28 But it is good for me to draw near unto God: 
\q1 I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, 
\q1 That I may tell of all thy works.

\d Maschil of Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 O God, why hast thou cast \add us\add* off for ever? 
\q1 Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
\q1
\v 2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, 
\q1 Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance;
\q1 \add And\add* mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 
\q1
\v 3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, 
\q1 All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary. 
\q1
\v 4 Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly;
\q1 They have set up their ensigns for signs. 
\q1
\v 5 They seemed as men that lifted up 
\q1 Axes upon a thicket of trees. 
\q1
\v 6 And now all the carved work thereof 
\q1 They break down with hatchet and hammers. 
\q1
\v 7 They have set thy sanctuary on fire; 
\q1 They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name \add by casting it
\add* to the ground. 
\q1
\v 8 They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
\q1 They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 
\q1
\v 9 We see not our signs: 
\q1 There is no more any prophet; 
\q1 Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 
\q1
\v 10 How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? 
\q1 Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 
\q1
\v 11 Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? 
\q1 \add Pluck it\add* out of thy bosom \add and\add* consume \add them\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yet God is my King of old, 
\q1 Working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: 
\q1 Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters. 
\q1
\v 14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; 
\q1 Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
\q1
\v 15 Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: 
\q1 Thou driedst up mighty rivers. 
\q1
\v 16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: 
\q1 Thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 
\q1
\v 17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: 
\q1 Thou hast made summer and winter. 
\q1
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, 
\q1 And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name. 
\q1
\v 19 Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast:
\q1 Forget not the life of thy poor for ever. 
\q1
\v 20 Have respect unto the covenant; 
\q1 For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
\q1
\v 21 Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: 
\q1 Let the poor and needy praise thy name. 
\q1
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: 
\q1 Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day. 
\q1
\v 23 Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: 
\q1 The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.

\v 2 When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. 
\q1
\v 3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:

\q1
\v 4 I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; 
\q1 And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 
\q1
\v 5 Lift not up your horn on high; 
\q1 Speak not with a stiff neck. 
\q1
\v 6 For neither from the east, nor from the west,

\q1
\v 7 But God is the judge: 
\q1 He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. 
\q1
\v 8 For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth;
\q1 It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: 
\q1 Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
\q1
\v 9 But I will declare for ever, 
\q1 I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

\v 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle,

\q1
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, 
\q1 Both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared; 
\q1 And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 
\q1
\v 8 Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; 
\q1 The earth feared, and was still, 
\q1
\v 9 When God arose to judgment, 
\q1 To save all the meek of the earth. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee:

\q1
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: 
\q1 My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; 
\q1 My soul refused to be comforted. 
\q1
\v 3 I remember God, and am disquieted: 
\q1 I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Thou holdest mine eyes watching: 
\q1 I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
\q1
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, 
\q1 The years of ancient times. 
\q1
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: 
\q1 I commune with mine own heart; 
\q1 And my spirit maketh diligent search. 
\q1
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? 
\q1 And will he be favorable no more? 
\q1
\v 8 Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? 
\q1 Doth his promise fail for evermore? 
\q1
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? 
\q1 Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 10 And I said, This is my infirmity;

\q1
\v 11 I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah;

\q1
\v 13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: 
\q1 Who is a great god like unto God? 
\q1
\v 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: 
\q1 Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. 
\q1
\v 15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, 
\q1 The sons of Jacob and Joseph. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\q1
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God;

\q1
\v 17 The clouds poured out water; 
\q1 The skies sent out a sound: 
\q1 Thine arrows also went abroad. 
\q1
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; 
\q1 The lightnings lightened the world: 
\q1 The earth trembled and shook. 
\q1
\v 19 Thy way was in the sea, 
\q1 And thy paths in the great waters, 
\q1 And thy footsteps were not known. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock,

\d Maschil of Asaph. 
\q1
\v 1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: 
\q1 Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
\q1
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable; 
\q1 I will utter dark sayings of old, 
\q1
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, 
\q1 And our fathers have told us. 
\q1
\v 4 We will not hide them from their children, 
\q1 Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, 
\q1 And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done. 
\q1
\v 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, 
\q1 And appointed a law in Israel, 
\q1 Which he commanded our fathers, 
\q1 That they should make them known to their children; 
\q1
\v 6 That the generation to come might know \add them\add*, even the children that should be born;
\q1 Who should arise and tell \add them\add* to their children, 
\q1
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, 
\q1 And not forget the works of God, 
\q1 But keep his commandments, 
\q1
\v 8 And might not be as their fathers, 
\q1 A stubborn and rebellious generation, 
\q1 A generation that set not their heart aright, 
\q1 And whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 
\q1
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, 
\q1 Turned back in the day of battle. 
\q1
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, 
\q1 And refused to walk in his law; 
\q1
\v 11 And they forgat his doings, 
\q1 And his wondrous works that he had showed them. 
\q1
\v 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, 
\q1 In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
\q1
\v 13 He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; 
\q1 And he made the waters to stand as a heap. 
\q1
\v 14 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, 
\q1 And all the night with a light of fire. 
\q1
\v 15 He clave rocks in the wilderness, 
\q1 And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. 
\q1
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, 
\q1 And caused waters to run down like rivers. 
\q1
\v 17 Yet went they on still to sin against him, 
\q1 To rebel against the Most High in the desert. 
\q1
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart 
\q1 By asking food according to their desire. 
\q1
\v 19 Yea, they spake against God; 
\q1 They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 
\q1
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, 
\q1 And streams overflowed; 
\q1 Can he give bread also? 
\q1 Will he provide flesh for his people? 
\q1
\v 21 Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; 
\q1 And a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
\q1 And anger also went up against Israel; 
\q1
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, 
\q1 And trusted not in his salvation. 
\q1
\v 23 Yet he commanded the skies above, 
\q1 And opened the doors of heaven; 
\q1
\v 24 And he rained down manna upon them to eat, 
\q1 And gave them food from heaven. 
\q1
\v 25 Man did eat the bread of the mighty: 
\q1 He sent them food to the full. 
\q1
\v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; 
\q1 And by his power he guided the south wind. 
\q1
\v 27 He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, 
\q1 And winged birds as the sand of the seas: 
\q1
\v 28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, 
\q1 Round about their habitations. 
\q1
\v 29 So they did eat, and were well filled; 
\q1 And he gave them their own desire. 
\q1
\v 30 They were not estranged from that which they desired, 
\q1 Their food was yet in their mouths, 
\q1
\v 31 When the anger of God went up against them, 
\q1 And slew of the fattest of them, 
\q1 And smote down the young men of Israel. 
\q1
\v 32 For all this they sinned still, 
\q1 And believed not in his wondrous works. 
\q1
\v 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, 
\q1 And their years in terror. 
\q1
\v 34 When he slew them, then they inquired after him; 
\q1 And they returned and sought God earnestly. 
\q1
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their rock, 
\q1 And the Most High God their redeemer. 
\q1
\v 36 But they flattered him with their mouth, 
\q1 And lied unto him with their tongue. 
\q1
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him, 
\q1 Neither were they faithful in his covenant. 
\q1
\v 38 But he, being merciful, forgave \add their\add* iniquity, and destroyed
\add them\add* not: 
\q1 Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, 
\q1 And did not stir up all his wrath. 
\q1
\v 39 And he remembered that they were but flesh, 
\q1 A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
\q1
\v 40 How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, 
\q1 And grieve him in the desert! 
\q1
\v 41 And they turned again and tempted God, 
\q1 And provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
\q1
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, 
\q1 Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; 
\q1
\v 43 How he set his signs in Egypt, 
\q1 And his wonders in the field of Zoan, 
\q1
\v 44 And turned their rivers into blood, 
\q1 And their streams, so that they could not drink. 
\q1
\v 45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; 
\q1 And frogs, which destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, 
\q1 And their labor unto the locust. 
\q1
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, 
\q1 And their sycomore-trees with frost. 
\q1
\v 48 He gave over their cattle also to the hail, 
\q1 And their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
\q1
\v 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, 
\q1 Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, 
\q1 A band of angels of evil. 
\q1
\v 50 He made a path for his anger; 
\q1 He spared not their soul from death, 
\q1 But gave their life over to the pestilence, 
\q1
\v 51 And smote all the first-born in Egypt, 
\q1 The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. 
\q1
\v 52 But he led forth his own people like sheep, 
\q1 And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
\q1
\v 53 And he led them safely, so that they feared not; 
\q1 But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
\q1
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, 
\q1 To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten. 
\q1
\v 55 He drove out the nations also before them, 
\q1 And allotted them for an inheritance by line, 
\q1 And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, 
\q1 And kept not his testimonies; 
\q1
\v 57 But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:
\q1 They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
\q1
\v 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, 
\q1 And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\q1
\v 59 When God heard \add this\add*, he was wroth, 
\q1 And greatly abhorred Israel; 
\q1
\v 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, 
\q1 The tent which he placed among men; 
\q1
\v 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, 
\q1 And his glory into the adversary’s hand. 
\q1
\v 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword, 
\q1 And was wroth with his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men; 
\q1 And their virgins had no marriage-song. 
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; 
\q1 And their widows made no lamentation. 
\q1
\v 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, 
\q1 Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
\q1
\v 66 And he smote his adversaries backward: 
\q1 He put them to a perpetual reproach. 
\q1
\v 67 Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, 
\q1 And chose not the tribe of Ephraim, 
\q1
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, 
\q1 The mount Zion which he loved. 
\q1
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary like the heights, 
\q1 Like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
\q1
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, 
\q1 And took him from the sheepfolds: 
\q1
\v 71 From following the ewes that have their young he brought him,
\q1 To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\q1
\v 72 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
\q1 And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

\v 1 O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; 
\q1 Thy holy temple have they defiled; 
\q1 They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. 
\q1
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens,
\q1 The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 
\q1
\v 3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
\q1 And there was none to bury them. 
\q1
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbors, 
\q1 A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us. 
\q1
\v 5 How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? 
\q1 Shall thy jealousy burn like fire? 
\q1
\v 6 Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, 
\q1 And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. 
\q1
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob, 
\q1 And laid waste his habitation. 
\q1
\v 8 Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: 
\q1 Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; 
\q1 For we are brought very low. 
\q1
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name;
\q1 And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name’s sake. 
\q1
\v 10 Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? 
\q1 Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed 
\q1 Be known among the nations in our sight. 
\q1
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: 
\q1 According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;
\q1
\v 12 And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom 
\q1 Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
\q1

\v 3 Turn us again, O God; 
\q1 And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 O Jehovah God of hosts, 
\q1 How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
\q1
\v 5 Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, 
\q1 And given them tears to drink in large measure. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; 
\q1 And our enemies laugh among themselves. 
\q1
\v 7 Turn us again, O God of hosts; 
\q1 And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: 
\q1 Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou preparedst \add room\add* before it, 
\q1 And it took deep root, and filled the land. 
\q1
\v 10 The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, 
\q1 And the boughs thereof were \add like\add* cedars of God. 
\q1
\v 11 It sent out its branches unto the sea, 
\q1 And its shoots unto the River. 
\q1
\v 12 Why hast thou broken down its walls, 
\q1 So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it? 
\q1
\v 13 The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, 
\q1 And the wild beasts of the field feed on it. 
\q1
\v 14 Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: 
\q1 Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine, 
\q1
\v 15 And the stock which thy right hand planted, 
\q1 And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 
\q1
\v 16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: 
\q1 They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 
\q1
\v 17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, 
\q1 Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 
\q1
\v 18 So shall we not go back from thee: 
\q1 Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name. 
\q1
\v 19 Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; 
\q1 Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

\q1 The pleasant harp with the psaltery. 
\q1
\v 3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, 
\q1 At the full moon, on our feast-day. 
\q1
\v 4 For it is a statute for Israel,

\q1
\v 5 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, 
\q1 When he went out over the land of Egypt, 
\q1 \add Where\add* I heard a language that I knew not. 
\q1
\v 6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: 
\q1 His hands were freed from the basket. 
\q1
\v 7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; 
\q1 I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; 
\q1 I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. \qs [Selah\qs* 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: 
\q1 O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! 
\q1
\v 9 There shall no strange god be in thee; 
\q1 Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. 
\q1
\v 10 I am Jehovah thy God, 
\q1 Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: 
\q1 Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
\q1
\v 11 But my people hearkened not to my voice; 
\q1 And Israel would none of me. 
\q1
\v 12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, 
\q1 That they might walk in their own counsels. 
\q1
\v 13 Oh that my people would hearken unto me, 
\q1 That Israel would walk in my ways! 
\q1
\v 14 I would soon subdue their enemies, 
\q1 And turn my hand against their adversaries. 
\q1
\v 15 The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: 
\q1 But their time should endure for ever. 
\q1
\v 16 He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; 
\q1 And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.

\v 4 Rescue the poor and needy:

\q1
\v 5 They know not, neither do they understand;

\q1 All the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
\q1
\v 6 I said, Ye are gods,

\v 7 Nevertheless ye shall die like men,

\v 1 O God, keep not thou silence:

\q1
\v 2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; 
\q1 And they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
\q1
\v 3 They take crafty counsel against thy people, 
\q1 And consult together against thy hidden ones. 
\q1
\v 4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
\q1 That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
\q1
\v 5 For they have consulted together with one consent; 
\q1 Against thee do they make a covenant: 
\q1
\v 6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; 
\q1 Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
\q1
\v 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; 
\q1 Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre: 
\q1
\v 8 Assyria also is joined with them; 
\q1 They have helped the children of Lot. \qs [Selah\qs*

\v 9 Do thou unto them as unto Midian,

\q1 Who became as dung for the earth. 
\q1
\v 11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; 
\q1 Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna; 
\q1
\v 12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession 
\q1 The habitations of God. 
\q1
\v 13 O my God, make them like the whirling dust; 
\q1 As stubble before the wind. 
\q1
\v 14 As the fire that burneth the forest, 
\q1 And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire, 
\q1
\v 15 So pursue them with thy tempest,

\v 16 Fill their faces with confusion,

\v 17 Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever;

\v 2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; 
\q1 Thou hast covered all their sin. \qs [Selah\qs*

\q1
\v 5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? 
\q1 Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?

\v 6 Wilt thou not quicken us again, 
\q1 That thy people may rejoice in thee? 
\q1
\v 7 Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, 
\q1 And grant us thy salvation.

\v 8 I will hear what God Jehovah will speak;

\v 12 Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good;

\v 2 Preserve my soul; for I am godly: 
\q1 O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 
\q1
\v 3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; 
\q1 For unto thee do I cry all the day long. 
\q1
\v 4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant; 
\q1 For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
\q1
\v 5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, 
\q1 And abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon thee.
\q1
\v 6 Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; 
\q1 And hearken unto the voice of my supplications. 
\q1
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; 
\q1 For thou wilt answer me. 
\q1
\v 8 There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; 
\q1 Neither \add are there any works\add* like unto thy works. 
\q1
\v 9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord;
\q1 And they shall glorify thy name. 
\q1
\v 10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: 
\q1 Thou art God alone. 
\q1
\v 11 Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: 
\q1 Unite my heart to fear thy name. 
\q1
\v 12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; 
\q1 And I will glorify thy name for evermore. 
\q1
\v 13 For great is thy lovingkindness toward me; 
\q1 And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol. 
\q1
\v 14 O God, the proud are risen up against me, 
\q1 And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, 
\q1 And have not set thee before them. 
\q1
\v 15 But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, 
\q1 Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth. 
\q1
\v 16 Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; 
\q1 Give thy strength unto thy servant, 
\q1 And save the son of thy handmaid. 
\q1

\q1
\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles, 
\q1 And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol. 
\q1
\v 4 I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; 
\q1 I am as a man that hath no help, 
\q1
\v 5 Cast off among the dead, 
\q1 Like the slain that lie in the grave, 
\q1 Whom thou rememberest no more, 
\q1 And they are cut off from thy hand. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, 
\q1 In dark places, in the deeps. 
\q1
\v 7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, 
\q1 And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. \qs [Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 8 Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; 
\q1 Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: 
\q1 I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 
\q1
\v 9 Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: 
\q1 I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; 
\q1 I have spread forth my hands unto thee. 
\q1
\v 10 Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? 
\q1 Shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? \qs [Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? 
\q1 Or thy faithfulness in Destruction? 
\q1
\v 12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? 
\q1 And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
\q1
\v 13 But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried; 
\q1 And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. 
\q1
\v 14 Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul? 
\q1 Why hidest thou thy face from me? 
\q1
\v 15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: 
\q1 While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. 
\q1
\v 16 Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; 
\q1 Thy terrors have cut me off. 
\q1
\v 17 They came round about me like water all the day long; 
\q1 They compassed me about together. 
\q1
\v 18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, 
\q1 And mine acquaintance into darkness.

\q1
\v 3 I have made a covenant with my chosen,

\q1
\v 8 O Jehovah God of hosts, 
\q1 Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? 
\q1 And thy faithfulness is round about thee.

\v 9 Thou rulest the pride of the sea: 
\q1 When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.

\v 10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; 
\q1 Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.
\q1
\v 11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: 
\q1 The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. 
\q1

\q1
\v 13 Thou hast a mighty arm; 
\q1 Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. 
\q1
\v 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne:

\q1
\v 19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, 
\q1 And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; 
\q1 I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 
\q1
\v 20 I have found David my servant; 
\q1 With my holy oil have I anointed him:

\v 21 With whom my hand shall be established;

\v 22 The enemy shall not exact from him, 
\q1 Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

\v 23 And I will beat down his adversaries before him, 
\q1 And smite them that hate him. 
\q1
\v 24 But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him;
\q1 And in my name shall his horn be exalted. 
\q1
\v 25 I will set his hand also on the sea, 
\q1 And his right hand on the rivers. 
\q1
\v 26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, 
\q1 My God, and the rock of my salvation. 
\q1
\v 27 I also will make him \add my\add* first-born,

\v 29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever,

\q1
\v 30 If his children forsake my law, 
\q1 And walk not in mine ordinances; 
\q1
\v 31 If they break my statutes, 
\q1 And keep not my commandments; 
\q1
\v 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, 
\q1 And their iniquity with stripes.

\q1 Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 
\q1
\v 34 My covenant will I not break, 
\q1 Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 
\q1
\v 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness:

\q1
\v 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges;

\q1
\v 41 All that pass by the way rob him:

\q1
\v 42 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; 
\q1 Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 
\q1
\v 43 Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword, 
\q1 And hast not made him to stand in the battle. 
\q1
\v 44 Thou hast made his brightness to cease, 
\q1 And cast his throne down to the ground. 
\q1
\v 45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: 
\q1 Thou hast covered him with shame. \qs [Selah\qs*

\q1
\v 1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place 
\q1 In all generations. 
\q1
\v 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, 
\q1 Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, 
\q1 Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 
\q1
\v 3 Thou turnest man to destruction, 
\q1 And sayest, Return, ye children of men. 
\q1
\v 4 For a thousand years in thy sight 
\q1 Are but as yesterday when it is past, 
\q1 And as a watch in the night. 
\q1
\v 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
\q1 In the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 
\q1
\v 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; 
\q1 In the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 
\q1
\v 7 For we are consumed in thine anger, 
\q1 And in thy wrath are we troubled. 
\q1
\v 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, 
\q1 Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 
\q1
\v 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: 
\q1 We bring our years to an end as a sigh. 
\q1
\v 10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten, 
\q1 Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; 
\q1 Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; 
\q1 For it is soon gone, and we fly away.

\v 11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger, 
\q1 And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? 
\q1
\v 12 So teach us to number our days, 
\q1 That we may get us a heart of wisdom.

\q1 And let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 
\q1
\v 14 Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness, 
\q1 That we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 
\q1
\v 15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,

\q1 And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; 
\q1 Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. 
\c 91  
\b
\q1
\v 1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High 
\q1 Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 
\q1
\v 2 I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; 
\q1 My God, in whom I trust. 
\q1
\v 3 For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, 
\q1 And from the deadly pestilence. 
\q1
\v 4 He will cover thee with his pinions, 
\q1 And under his wings shalt thou take refuge: 
\q1 His truth is a shield and a buckler. 
\q1
\v 5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, 
\q1 Nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 
\q1
\v 6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, 
\q1 Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 
\q1
\v 7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, 
\q1 And ten thousand at thy right hand; 
\q1 \add But\add* it shall not come nigh thee. 
\q1
\v 8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, 
\q1 And see the reward of the wicked. 
\q1
\v 9 For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! 
\q1 Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; 
\q1
\v 10 There shall no evil befall thee, 
\q1 Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. 
\q1
\v 11 For he will give his angels charge over thee, 
\q1 To keep thee in all thy ways. 
\q1
\v 12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, 
\q1 Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: 
\q1 The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot.
\q1
\v 14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
\q1 I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 
\q1
\v 15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; 
\q1 I will be with him in trouble: 
\q1 I will deliver him, and honor him. 
\q1
\v 16 With long life will I satisfy him, 
\q1 And show him my salvation. 
\c 92  
\d A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. 
\q1
\v 1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, 
\q1 And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High; 
\q1
\v 2 To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, 
\q1 And thy faithfulness every night, 
\q1
\v 3 With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; 
\q1 With a solemn sound upon the harp. 
\q1
\v 4 For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: 
\q1 I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 
\q1
\v 5 How great are thy works, O Jehovah! 
\q1 Thy thoughts are very deep. 
\q1
\v 6 A brutish man knoweth not; 
\q1 Neither doth a fool understand this: 
\q1
\v 7 When the wicked spring as the grass, 
\q1 And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; 
\q1 It is that they shall be destroyed for ever. 
\q1
\v 8 But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore. 
\q1
\v 9 For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, 
\q1 For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; 
\q1 All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
\q1
\v 10 But my horn hast thou exalted like \add the horn of\add* the wild-ox:
\q1 I am anointed with fresh oil. 
\q1
\v 11 Mine eye also hath seen \add my desire\add* on mine enemies,
\q1 Mine ears have heard \add my desire\add* of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
\q1
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: 
\q1 He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
\q1
\v 13 They are planted in the house of Jehovah; 
\q1 They shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
\q1
\v 14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; 
\q1 They shall be full of sap and green: 
\q1
\v 15 To show that Jehovah is upright; 
\q1 He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 
\c 93  
\b
\q1
\v 1 Jehovah reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; 
\q1 Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith:
\q1 The world also is established, that it cannot be moved. 
\q1
\v 2 Thy throne is established of old: 
\q1 Thou art from everlasting. 
\q1
\v 3 The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, 
\q1 The floods have lifted up their voice; 
\q1 The floods lift up their waves. 
\q1
\v 4 Above the voices of many waters, 
\q1 The mighty breakers of the sea, 
\q1 Jehovah on high is mighty. 
\q1
\v 5 Thy testimonies are very sure: 
\q1 Holiness becometh thy house, 
\q1 O Jehovah, for evermore. 
\c 94  
\b
\q1
\v 1 O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, 
\q1 Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth. 
\q1
\v 2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: 
\q1 Render to the proud \add their\add* desert. 
\q1
\v 3 Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, 
\q1 How long shall the wicked triumph? 
\q1
\v 4 They prate, they speak arrogantly: 
\q1 All the workers of iniquity boast themselves. 
\q1
\v 5 They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, 
\q1 And afflict thy heritage. 
\q1
\v 6 They slay the widow and the sojourner, 
\q1 And murder the fatherless. 
\q1
\v 7 And they say, Jehovah will not see, 
\q1 Neither will the God of Jacob consider. 
\q1
\v 8 Consider, ye brutish among the people; 
\q1 And ye fools, when will ye be wise? 
\q1
\v 9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? 
\q1 He that formed the eye, shall he not see? 
\q1
\v 10 He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, 
\q1 \add Even\add* he that teacheth man knowledge? 
\q1
\v 11 Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, 
\q1 That they are vanity. 
\q1
\v 12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, 
\q1 And teachest out of thy law; 
\q1
\v 13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
\q1 Until the pit be digged for the wicked. 
\q1
\v 14 For Jehovah will not cast off his people, 
\q1 Neither will he forsake his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 15 For judgment shall return unto righteousness; 
\q1 And all the upright in heart shall follow it. 
\q1
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? 
\q1 Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
\q1
\v 17 Unless Jehovah had been my help, 
\q1 My soul had soon dwelt in silence. 
\q1
\v 18 When I said, My foot slippeth; 
\q1 Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up. 
\q1
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
\q1
\v 20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, 
\q1 Which frameth mischief by statute? 
\q1
\v 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
\q1 And condemn the innocent blood. 
\q1
\v 22 But Jehovah hath been my high tower, 
\q1 And my God the rock of my refuge. 
\q1
\v 23 And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, 
\q1 And will cut them off in their own wickedness; 
\q1 Jehovah our God will cut them off. 
\c 95  
\b
\q1
\v 1 Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; 
\q1 Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
\q1
\v 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; 
\q1 Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 
\q1
\v 3 For Jehovah is a great God, 
\q1 And a great King above all gods. 
\q1
\v 4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth; 
\q1 The heights of the mountains are his also. 
\q1
\v 5 The sea is his, and he made it; 
\q1 And his hands formed the dry land. 
\q1
\v 6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; 
\q1 Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker: 
\q1
\v 7 For he is our God, 
\q1 And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
\q1 To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice! 
\q1
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, 
\q1 As in the day of Massah in the wilderness; 
\q1
\v 9 When your fathers tempted me, 
\q1 Proved me, and saw my work. 
\q1
\v 10 Forty years long was I grieved with \add that\add* generation,
\q1 And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, 
\q1 And they have not known my ways: 
\q1
\v 11 Wherefore I sware in my wrath, 
\q1 That they should not enter into my rest. 
\c 96  
\b
\q1
\v 1 Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: 
\q1 Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. 
\q1
\v 2 Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; 
\q1 Show forth his salvation from day to day. 
\q1
\v 3 Declare his glory among the nations, 
\q1 His marvellous works among all the peoples. 
\q1
\v 4 For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: 
\q1 He is to be feared above all gods. 
\q1
\v 5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols; 
\q1 But Jehovah made the heavens. 
\q1
\v 6 Honor and majesty are before him: 
\q1 Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
\q1
\v 7 Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, 
\q1 Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. 
\q1
\v 8 Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: 
\q1 Bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
\q1
\v 9 Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: 
\q1 Tremble before him, all the earth. 
\q1
\v 10 Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: 
\q1 The world also is established that it cannot be moved: 
\q1 He will judge the peoples with equity. 
\q1
\v 11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; 
\q1 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 
\q1
\v 12 Let the field exult, and all that is therein; 
\q1 Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy 
\q1
\v 13 Before Jehovah; for he cometh, 
\q1 For he cometh to judge the earth: 
\q1 He will judge the world with righteousness, 
\q1 And the peoples with his truth. 
\c 97  
\b
\q1
\v 1 Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice; 
\q1 Let the multitude of isles be glad. 
\q1
\v 2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: 
\q1 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 
\q1
\v 3 A fire goeth before him, 
\q1 And burneth up his adversaries round about. 
\q1
\v 4 His lightnings lightened the world: 
\q1 The earth saw, and trembled. 
\q1
\v 5 The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, 
\q1 At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
\q1
\v 6 The heavens declare his righteousness, 
\q1 And all the peoples have seen his glory. 
\q1
\v 7 Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images, 
\q1 That boast themselves of idols: 
\q1 Worship him, all ye gods. 
\q1
\v 8 Zion heard and was glad, 
\q1 And the daughters of Judah rejoiced, 
\q1 Because of thy judgments, O Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 9 For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: 
\q1 Thou art exalted far above all gods. 
\q1
\v 10 O ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: 
\q1 He preserveth the souls of his saints; 
\q1 He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
\q1
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous, 
\q1 And gladness for the upright in heart. 
\q1
\v 12 Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; 
\q1 And give thanks to his holy memorial \add name\add*. 
\c 98  
\d A Psalm. 
\q1
\v 1 Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; 
\q1 For he hath done marvellous things: 
\q1 His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.
\q1
\v 2 Jehovah hath made known his salvation: 
\q1 His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.
\q1
\v 3 He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel:
\q1 All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\q1
\v 4 Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: 
\q1 Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. 
\q1
\v 5 Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; 
\q1 With the harp and the voice of melody. 
\q1
\v 6 With trumpets and sound of cornet 
\q1 Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 
\q1 The world, and they that dwell therein; 
\q1
\v 8 Let the floods clap their hands; 
\q1 Let the hills sing for joy together 
\q1

\q1 He will judge the world with righteousness, 
\q1 And the peoples with equity.

\v 2 Jehovah is great in Zion; 
\q1 And he is high above all the peoples. 
\q1
\v 3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name: 
\q1 Holy is he.

\q1
\v 4 The king’s strength also loveth justice; 
\q1 Thou dost establish equity; 
\q1 Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob. 
\q1
\v 5 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, 
\q1 And worship at his footstool: 
\q1 Holy is he. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, 
\q1 And Samuel among them that call upon his name; 
\q1 They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them. 
\q1
\v 7 He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: 
\q1 They kept his testimonies, 
\q1 And the statute that he gave them. 
\q1
\v 8 Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: 
\q1 Thou wast a God that forgavest them, 
\q1 Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. 
\q1
\v 9 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, 
\q1 And worship at his holy hill; 
\q1 For Jehovah our God is holy. 
\c 100  
\d A Psalm of thanksgiving. 
\q1
\v 1 Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands. 
\q1
\v 2 Serve Jehovah with gladness: 
\q1 Come before his presence with singing. 
\q1
\v 3 Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: 
\q1 It is he that hath made us, and we are his; 
\q1 We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
\q1
\v 4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
\q1 And into his courts with praise: 
\q1 Give thanks unto him, and bless his name. 
\q1
\v 5 For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness \add endureth\add* for ever,
\q1 And his faithfulness unto all generations. 
\c 101  
\d A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: 
\q1 Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises. 
\q1
\v 2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: 
\q1 Oh when wilt thou come unto me? 
\q1 I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
\q1
\v 3 I will set no base thing before mine eyes: 
\q1 I hate the work of them that turn aside; 
\q1 It shall not cleave unto me. 
\q1
\v 4 A perverse heart shall depart from me: 
\q1 I will know no evil thing. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: 
\q1 Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
\q1
\v 6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me:
\q1 He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.
\q1
\v 7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: 
\q1 He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
\q1
\v 8 Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;
\q1 To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.
\c 102  
\d A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, 
\q1 And let my cry come unto thee. 
\q1
\v 2 Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: 
\q1 Incline thine ear unto me; 
\q1 In the day when I call answer me speedily. 
\q1
\v 3 For my days consume away like smoke, 
\q1 And my bones are burned as a firebrand. 
\q1
\v 4 My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; 
\q1 For I forget to eat my bread. 
\q1
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning 
\q1 My bones cleave to my flesh. 
\q1
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness; 
\q1 I am become as an owl of the waste places. 
\q1
\v 7 I watch, and am become like a sparrow 
\q1 That is alone upon the house-top. 
\q1
\v 8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; 
\q1 They that are mad against me do curse by me. 
\q1
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, 
\q1 And mingled my drink with weeping, 
\q1
\v 10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: 
\q1 For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. 
\q1
\v 11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; 
\q1 And I am withered like grass. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; 
\q1 And thy memorial \add name\add* unto all generations. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; 
\q1 For it is time to have pity upon her, 
\q1 Yea, the set time is come. 
\q1
\v 14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, 
\q1 And have pity upon her dust. 
\q1
\v 15 So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, 
\q1 And all the kings of the earth thy glory. 
\q1
\v 16 For Jehovah hath built up Zion; 
\q1 He hath appeared in his glory. 
\q1
\v 17 He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, 
\q1 And hath not despised their prayer. 
\q1
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come; 
\q1 And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; 
\q1 From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth; 
\q1
\v 20 To hear the sighing of the prisoner; 
\q1 To loose those that are appointed to death; 
\q1
\v 21 That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, 
\q1 And his praise in Jerusalem; 
\q1
\v 22 When the peoples are gathered together, 
\q1 And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 He weakened my strength in the way; 
\q1 He shortened my days. 
\q1
\v 24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
\q1 Thy years are throughout all generations. 
\q1
\v 25 Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; 
\q1 And the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
\q1
\v 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; 
\q1 Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; 
\q1 As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
\q1
\v 27 But thou art the same, 
\q1 And thy years shall have no end. 
\q1
\v 28 The children of thy servants shall continue, 
\q1 And their seed shall be established before thee.

\d \add A Psalm\add* of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul; 
\q1 And all that is within me, \add bless\add* his holy name. 
\q1
\v 2 Bless Jehovah, O my soul, 
\q1 And forget not all his benefits: 
\q1
\v 3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; 
\q1 Who healeth all thy diseases; 
\q1
\v 4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; 
\q1 Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; 
\q1
\v 5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, 
\q1 \add So that\add* thy youth is renewed like the eagle. 
\q1
\v 6 Jehovah executeth righteous acts, 
\q1 And judgments for all that are oppressed. 
\q1
\v 7 He made known his ways unto Moses, 
\q1 His doings unto the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 8 Jehovah is merciful and gracious, 
\q1 Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness. 
\q1
\v 9 He will not always chide; 
\q1 Neither will he keep \add his anger\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins, 
\q1 Nor rewarded us after our iniquities. 
\q1
\v 11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, 
\q1 So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him. 
\q1
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, 
\q1 So far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
\q1
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth his children, 
\q1 So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him. 
\q1
\v 14 For he knoweth our frame; 
\q1 He remembereth that we are dust. 
\q1
\v 15 As for man, his days are as grass; 
\q1 As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
\q1
\v 16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; 
\q1 And the place thereof shall know it no more. 
\q1
\v 17 But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,
\q1 And his righteousness unto children’s children; 
\q1
\v 18 To such as keep his covenant, 
\q1 And to those that remember his precepts to do them. 
\q1
\v 19 Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; 
\q1 And his kingdom ruleth over all. 
\q1
\v 20 Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, 
\q1 That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, 
\q1 Hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
\q1
\v 21 Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, 
\q1 Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
\q1
\v 22 Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, 
\q1 In all places of his dominion: 
\q1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul. 
\c 104  
\q1
\v 1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul. 
\q1 O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; 
\q1 Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: 
\q1
\v 2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; 
\q1 Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; 
\q1
\v 3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; 
\q1 Who maketh the clouds his chariot; 
\q1 Who walketh upon the wings of the wind; 
\q1
\v 4 Who maketh winds his messengers; 
\q1 Flames of fire his ministers; 
\q1
\v 5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, 
\q1 That it should not be moved for ever. 
\q1
\v 6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; 
\q1 The waters stood above the mountains. 
\q1
\v 7 At thy rebuke they fled; 
\q1 At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away 
\q1
\v 8 (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) 
\q1 Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. 
\q1
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; 
\q1 That they turn not again to cover the earth. 
\q1
\v 10 He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; 
\q1 They run among the mountains; 
\q1
\v 11 They give drink to every beast of the field; 
\q1 The wild asses quench their thirst. 
\q1
\v 12 By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; 
\q1 They sing among the branches. 
\q1
\v 13 He watereth the mountains from his chambers: 
\q1 The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. 
\q1
\v 14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, 
\q1 And herb for the service of man; 
\q1 That he may bring forth food out of the earth, 
\q1
\v 15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, 
\q1 \add And\add* oil to make his face to shine, 
\q1 And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart. 
\q1
\v 16 The trees of Jehovah are filled \add with moisture\add*, 
\q1 The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 
\q1
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests: 
\q1 As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. 
\q1
\v 18 The high mountains are for the wild goats; 
\q1 The rocks are a refuge for the conies. 
\q1
\v 19 He appointed the moon for seasons: 
\q1 The sun knoweth his going down. 
\q1
\v 20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night, 
\q1 Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. 
\q1
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey, 
\q1 And seek their food from God. 
\q1
\v 22 The sun ariseth, they get them away, 
\q1 And lay them down in their dens. 
\q1
\v 23 Man goeth forth unto his work 
\q1 And to his labor until the evening. 
\q1
\v 24 O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! 
\q1 In wisdom hast thou made them all: 
\q1 The earth is full of thy riches. 
\q1
\v 25 Yonder is the sea, great and wide, 
\q1 Wherein are things creeping innumerable, 
\q1 Both small and great beasts. 
\q1
\v 26 There go the ships; 
\q1 There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein. 
\q1
\v 27 These wait all for thee, 
\q1 That thou mayest give them their food in due season. 
\q1
\v 28 Thou givest unto them, they gather; 
\q1 Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. 
\q1
\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; 
\q1 Thou takest away their breath, they die, 
\q1 And return to their dust. 
\q1
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; 
\q1 And thou renewest the face of the ground. 
\q1
\v 31 Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; 
\q1 Let Jehovah rejoice in his works: 
\q1
\v 32 Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; 
\q1 He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. 
\q1
\v 33 I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: 
\q1 I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 
\q1
\v 34 Let my meditation be sweet unto him: 
\q1 I will rejoice in Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. 
\q1 And let the wicked be no more. 
\q1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul. 
\q1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\c 105  
\q1
\v 1 Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; 
\q1 Make known among the peoples his doings. 
\q1
\v 2 Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; 
\q1 Talk ye of all his marvelous works. 
\q1
\v 3 Glory ye in his holy name: 
\q1 Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 4 Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; 
\q1 Seek his face evermore. 
\q1
\v 5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, 
\q1 His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, 
\q1
\v 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, 
\q1 Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
\q1
\v 7 He is Jehovah our God: 
\q1 His judgments are in all the earth. 
\q1
\v 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, 
\q1 The word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 
\q1
\v 9  \add The covenant\add* which he made with Abraham, 
\q1 And his oath unto Isaac, 
\q1
\v 10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, 
\q1 To Israel for an everlasting covenant, 
\q1
\v 11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, 
\q1 The lot of your inheritance; 
\q1
\v 12 When they were but a few men in number, 
\q1 Yea, very few, and sojourners in it. 
\q1
\v 13 And they went about from nation to nation, 
\q1 From one kingdom to another people. 
\q1
\v 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong; 
\q1 Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 
\q1
\v 15  \add Saying\add*, Touch not mine anointed ones, 
\q1 And do my prophets no harm. 
\q1
\v 16 And he called for a famine upon the land; 
\q1 He brake the whole staff of bread. 
\q1
\v 17 He sent a man before them; 
\q1 Joseph was sold for a servant: 
\q1
\v 18 His feet they hurt with fetters: 
\q1 He was laid in \add chains of\add* iron, 
\q1
\v 19 Until the time that his word came to pass, 
\q1 The word of Jehovah tried him. 
\q1
\v 20 The king sent and loosed him; 
\q1 Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. 
\q1
\v 21 He made him lord of his house, 
\q1 And ruler of all his substance; 
\q1
\v 22 To bind his princes at his pleasure, 
\q1 And teach his elders wisdom. 
\q1
\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt; 
\q1 And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
\q1
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly, 
\q1 And made them stronger than their adversaries. 
\q1
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, 
\q1 To deal subtly with his servants. 
\q1
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant, 
\q1 \add And\add* Aaron whom he had chosen. 
\q1
\v 27 They set among them his signs, 
\q1 And wonders in the land of Ham. 
\q1
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; 
\q1 And they rebelled not against his words. 
\q1
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, 
\q1 And slew their fish. 
\q1
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs 
\q1 In the chambers of their kings. 
\q1
\v 31 He spake, and there came swarms of flies, 
\q1 And lice in all their borders. 
\q1
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain, 
\q1 \add And\add* flaming fire in their land. 
\q1
\v 33 He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, 
\q1 And brake the trees of their borders. 
\q1
\v 34 He spake, and the locust came, 
\q1 And the grasshopper, and that without number, 
\q1
\v 35 And did eat up every herb in their land, 
\q1 And did eat up the fruit of their ground. 
\q1
\v 36 He smote also all the first-born in their land, 
\q1 The chief of all their strength. 
\q1
\v 37 And he brought them forth with silver and gold; 
\q1 And there was not one feeble person among his tribes. 
\q1
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed; 
\q1 For the fear of them had fallen upon them. 
\q1
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering, 
\q1 And fire to give light in the night. 
\q1
\v 40 They asked, and he brought quails, 
\q1 And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
\q1
\v 41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; 
\q1 They ran in the dry places \add like\add* a river. 
\q1
\v 42 For he remembered his holy word, 
\q1 \add And\add* Abraham his servant. 
\q1
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with joy, 
\q1 \add And\add* his chosen with singing. 
\q1
\v 44 And he gave them the lands of the nations; 
\q1 And they took the labor of the peoples in possession: 
\q1
\v 45 That they might keep his statutes, 
\q1 And observe his laws. 
\q1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\c 106  
\q1
\v 1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\q1 Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; 
\q1 For his lovingkindness \add endureth\add* forever. 
\q1
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, 
\q1 Or show forth all his praise? 
\q1
\v 3 Blessed are they that keep justice, 
\q1 And he that doeth righteousness at all times. 
\q1
\v 4 Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people;
\q1 Oh visit me with thy salvation, 
\q1
\v 5 That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, 
\q1 That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, 
\q1 That I may glory with thine inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, 
\q1 We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
\q1
\v 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; 
\q1 They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, 
\q1 But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. 
\q1
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, 
\q1 That he might make his mighty power to be known. 
\q1
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: 
\q1 So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. 
\q1
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, 
\q1 And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\q1
\v 11 And the waters covered their adversaries; 
\q1 There was not one of them left. 
\q1
\v 12 Then believed they his words; 
\q1 They sang his praise. 
\q1
\v 13 They soon forgat his works; 
\q1 They waited not for his counsel, 
\q1
\v 14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, 
\q1 And tempted God in the desert. 
\q1
\v 15 And he gave them their request, 
\q1 But sent leanness into their soul. 
\q1
\v 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, 
\q1 \add And\add* Aaron the saint of Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, 
\q1 And covered the company of Abiram. 
\q1
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; 
\q1 The flame burned up the wicked. 
\q1
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, 
\q1 And worshipped a molten image. 
\q1
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory 
\q1 For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. 
\q1
\v 21 They forgat God their Saviour, 
\q1 Who had done great things in Egypt, 
\q1
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, 
\q1 \add And\add* terrible things by the Red Sea. 
\q1
\v 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, 
\q1 Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, 
\q1 To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, 
\q1 They believed not his word, 
\q1
\v 25 But murmured in their tents, 
\q1 And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 26 Therefore he sware unto them, 
\q1 That he would overthrow them in the wilderness, 
\q1
\v 27 And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, 
\q1 And scatter them in the lands. 
\q1
\v 28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, 
\q1 And ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
\q1
\v 29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; 
\q1 And the plague brake in upon them. 
\q1
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; 
\q1 And so the plague was stayed. 
\q1
\v 31 And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, 
\q1 Unto all generations for evermore. 
\q1
\v 32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, 
\q1 So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; 
\q1
\v 33 Because they were rebellious against his spirit, 
\q1 And he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 
\q1
\v 34 They did not destroy the peoples, 
\q1 As Jehovah commanded them, 
\q1
\v 35 But mingled themselves with the nations, 
\q1 And learned their works, 
\q1
\v 36 And served their idols, 
\q1 Which became a snare unto them. 
\q1
\v 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
\q1
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, 
\q1 Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, 
\q1 Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; 
\q1 And the land was polluted with blood. 
\q1
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their works, 
\q1 And played the harlot in their doings. 
\q1
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people,
\q1 And he abhorred his inheritance. 
\q1
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the nations; 
\q1 And they that hated them ruled over them. 
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, 
\q1 And they were brought into subjection under their hand. 
\q1
\v 43 Many times did he deliver them; 
\q1 But they were rebellious in their counsel, 
\q1 And were brought low in their iniquity. 
\q1
\v 44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, 
\q1 When he heard their cry: 
\q1
\v 45 And he remembered for them his covenant, 
\q1 And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
\q1
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied 
\q1 Of all those that carried them captive. 
\b
\q1
\v 47 Save us, O Jehovah our God, 
\q1 And gather us from among the nations, 
\q1 To give thanks unto thy holy name, 
\q1 And to triumph in thy praise. 
\b
\q1
\v 48 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, 
\q1 From everlasting even to everlasting. 
\q1 And let all the people say, Amen. 
\q1 Praise ye Jehovah.

\ms1 BOOK V 
\b
\q1
\v 1 O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; 
\q1 For his lovingkindness \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 2 Let the redeemed of Jehovah say \add so\add*, 
\q1 Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary, 
\q1
\v 3 And gathered out of the lands, 
\q1 From the east and from the west, 
\q1 From the north and from the south. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; 
\q1 They found no city of habitation. 
\q1
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, 
\q1 Their soul fainted in them. 
\q1
\v 6 Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, 
\q1 And he delivered them out of their distresses, 
\q1
\v 7 He led them also by a straight way, 
\q1 That they might go to a city of habitation. 
\q1
\v 8 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, 
\q1 And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, 
\q1 And the hungry soul he filleth with good. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
\q1 Being bound in affliction and iron, 
\q1
\v 11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, 
\q1 And contemned the counsel of the Most High: 
\q1
\v 12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; 
\q1 They fell down, and there was none to help. 
\q1
\v 13 Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, 
\q1 And he saved them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, 
\q1 And brake their bonds in sunder. 
\q1
\v 15 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, 
\q1 And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, 
\q1 And cut the bars of iron in sunder. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 Fools because of their transgression, 
\q1 And because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 
\q1
\v 18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; 
\q1 And they draw near unto the gates of death. 
\q1
\v 19 Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, 
\q1 And he saveth them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 20 He sendeth his word, and healeth them, 
\q1 And delivereth \add them\add* from their destructions. 
\q1
\v 21 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, 
\q1 And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 22 And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, 
\q1 And declare his works with singing. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 They that go down to the sea in ships, 
\q1 That do business in great waters; 
\q1
\v 24 These see the works of Jehovah, 
\q1 And his wonders in the deep. 
\q1
\v 25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, 
\q1 Which lifteth up the waves thereof. 
\q1
\v 26 They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths:
\q1 Their soul melteth away because of trouble. 
\q1
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, 
\q1 And are at their wits’ end. 
\q1
\v 28 Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, 
\q1 And he bringeth them out of their distresses. 
\q1
\v 29 He maketh the storm a calm, 
\q1 So that the waves thereof are still. 
\q1
\v 30 Then are they glad because they are quiet; 
\q1 So he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
\q1
\v 31 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, 
\q1 And for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
\q1
\v 32 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, 
\q1 And praise him in the seat of the elders. 
\b
\q1
\v 33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, 
\q1 And watersprings into a thirsty ground; 
\q1
\v 34 A fruitful land into a salt desert, 
\q1 For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 
\q1
\v 35 He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, 
\q1 And a dry land into watersprings. 
\q1
\v 36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, 
\q1 That they may prepare a city of habitation, 
\q1
\v 37 And sow fields, and plant vineyards, 
\q1 And get them fruits of increase. 
\q1
\v 38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
\q1 And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 
\q1
\v 39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down 
\q1 Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. 
\q1
\v 40 He poureth contempt upon princes, 
\q1 And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
\q1
\v 41 Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, 
\q1 And maketh \add him\add* families like a flock. 
\q1
\v 42 The upright shall see it, and be glad; 
\q1 And all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 
\q1
\v 43 Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; 
\q1 And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah. 
\c 108  
\d A Song, A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 My heart is fixed, O God; 
\q1 I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory. 
\q1
\v 2 Awake, psaltery and harp: 
\q1 I myself will awake right early. 
\q1
\v 3 I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples;
\q1 And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
\q1
\v 4 For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; 
\q1 And thy truth \add reacheth\add* unto the skies. 
\q1
\v 5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, 
\q1 And thy glory above all the earth. 
\q1
\v 6 That thy beloved may be delivered, 
\q1 Save with thy right hand, and answer us. 
\q1
\v 7 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; 
\q1 I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
\q1
\v 8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; 
\q1 Ephraim also is the defence of my head; 
\q1 Judah is my sceptre. 
\q1
\v 9 Moab is my washpot; 
\q1 Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; 
\q1 Over Philistia will I shout. 
\q1
\v 10 Who will bring me into the fortified city? 
\q1 Who hath led me unto Edom? 
\q1
\v 11 Hast not thou cast us off, O God? 
\q1 And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 
\q1
\v 12 Give us help against the adversary; 
\q1 For vain is the help of man. 
\q1
\v 13 Through God we shall do valiantly: 
\q1 For he it is that will tread down our adversaries. 
\c 109  
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 
\q1
\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me:
\q1 They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. 
\q1
\v 3 They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, 
\q1 And fought against me without a cause. 
\q1
\v 4 For my love they are my adversaries: 
\q1 But I \add give myself unto\add* prayer. 
\q1
\v 5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, 
\q1 And hatred for my love. 
\q1
\v 6 Set thou a wicked man over him; 
\q1 And let an adversary stand at his right hand. 
\q1
\v 7 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; 
\q1 And let his prayer be turned into sin. 
\q1
\v 8 Let his days be few; 
\q1 \add And\add* let another take his office. 
\q1
\v 9 Let his children be fatherless, 
\q1 And his wife a widow. 
\q1
\v 10 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; 
\q1 And let them seek \add their bread\add* out of their desolate places.
\q1
\v 11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; 
\q1 And let strangers make spoil of his labor. 
\q1
\v 12 Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; 
\q1 Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
\q1
\v 13 Let his posterity be cut off; 
\q1 In the generation following let their name be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah;
\q1 And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 
\q1
\v 15 Let them be before Jehovah continually, 
\q1 That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth; 
\q1
\v 16 Because he remembered not to show kindness, 
\q1 But persecuted the poor and needy man, 
\q1 And the broken in heart, to slay \add them\add*. 
\q1
\v 17 Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; 
\q1 And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him. 
\q1
\v 18 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, 
\q1 And it came into his inward parts like water, 
\q1 And like oil into his bones. 
\q1
\v 19 Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,
\q1 And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 
\q1
\v 20 This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, 
\q1 And of them that speak evil against my soul. 
\q1
\v 21 But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name’s sake:
\q1 Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me; 
\q1
\v 22 For I am poor and needy, 
\q1 And my heart is wounded within me. 
\q1
\v 23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: 
\q1 I am tossed up and down as the locust. 
\q1
\v 24 My knees are weak through fasting; 
\q1 And my flesh faileth of fatness. 
\q1
\v 25 I am become also a reproach unto them: 
\q1 When they see me, they shake their head. 
\q1
\v 26 Help me, O Jehovah my God; 
\q1 Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness: 
\q1
\v 27 That they may know that this is thy hand; 
\q1 \add That\add* thou, Jehovah, hast done it. 
\q1
\v 28 Let them curse, but bless thou: 
\q1 When they arise, they shall be put to shame, 
\q1 But thy servant shall rejoice. 
\q1
\v 29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, 
\q1 And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
\q1
\v 30 I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; 
\q1 Yea, I will praise him among the multitude. 
\q1
\v 31 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, 
\q1 To save him from them that judge his soul. 
\c 110  
\d A Psalm of David. 
\q1
\v 1 Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, 
\q1 Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 
\q1
\v 2 Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion:
\q1 Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 
\q1
\v 3 Thy people offer themselves willingly 
\q1 In the day of thy power, in holy array: 
\q1 Out of the womb of the morning 
\q1 Thou hast the dew of thy youth. 
\q1
\v 4 Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: 
\q1 Thou art a priest for ever 
\q1 After the order of Melchizedek. 
\q1
\v 5 The Lord at thy right hand 
\q1 Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 
\q1
\v 6 He will judge among the nations, 
\q1 He will fill \add the places\add* with dead bodies; 
\q1 He will strike through the head in many countries. 
\q1
\v 7 He will drink of the brook in the way: 
\q1 Therefore will he lift up the head. 
\c 111  
\q1
\v 1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\q1 I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, 
\q1 In the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
\q1
\v 2 The works of Jehovah are great, 
\q1 Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 
\q1
\v 3 His work is honor and majesty;

\q1
\v 4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: 
\q1 Jehovah is gracious and merciful. 
\q1
\v 5 He hath given food unto them that fear him: 
\q1 He will ever be mindful of his covenant. 
\q1
\v 6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, 
\q1 In giving them the heritage of the nations. 
\q1
\v 7 The works of his hands are truth and justice; 
\q1 All his precepts are sure. 
\q1
\v 8 They are established for ever and ever; 
\q1 They are done in truth and uprightness. 
\q1
\v 9 He hath sent redemption unto his people; 
\q1 He hath commanded his covenant for ever: 
\q1 Holy and reverend is his name. 
\q1
\v 10 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom;

\q1
\v 5 Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth;

\v 6 For he shall never be moved;

\q1
\v 7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:

\q1
\v 8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,

\q1
\v 3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same 
\q1 Jehovah’s name is to be praised. 
\q1
\v 4 Jehovah is high above all nations,

\v 5 Who is like unto Jehovah our God, 
\q1 That hath his seat on high, 
\q1
\v 6 That humbleth himself to behold 
\q1 \add The things that are\add* in heaven and in the earth? 
\q1
\v 7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, 
\q1 And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; 
\q1
\v 8 That he may set him with princes, 
\q1 Even with the princes of his people. 
\q1
\v 9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, 
\q1 \add And to be\add* a joyful mother of children.

\v 1 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, 
\q1 The house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
\q1
\v 2 Judah became his sanctuary, 
\q1 Israel his dominion. 
\q1
\v 3 The sea saw it, and fled; 
\q1 The Jordan was driven back. 
\q1
\v 4 The mountains skipped like rams, 
\q1 The little hills like lambs. 
\q1
\v 5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? 
\q1 Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? 
\q1
\v 6 Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; 
\q1 Ye little hills, like lambs? 
\q1
\v 7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, 
\q1 At the presence of the God of Jacob, 
\q1
\v 8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water, 
\q1 The flint into a fountain of waters. 
\c 115  
\q1
\v 1 Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, 
\q1 But unto thy name give glory, 
\q1 For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake. 
\q1
\v 2 Wherefore should the nations say, 
\q1 Where is now their God? 
\q1
\v 3 But our God is in the heavens: 
\q1 He hath done whatsoever he pleased. 
\q1
\v 4 Their idols are silver and gold, 
\q1 The work of men’s hands. 
\q1
\v 5 They have mouths, but they speak not; 
\q1 Eyes have they, but they see not; 
\q1
\v 6 They have ears, but they hear not; 
\q1 Noses have they, but they smell not; 
\q1
\v 7 They have hands, but they handle not; 
\q1 Feet have they, but they walk not; 
\q1 Neither speak they through their throat. 
\q1
\v 8 They that make them shall be like unto them; 
\q1 Yea, every one that trusteth in them. 
\q1
\v 9 O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah: 
\q1 He is their help and their shield. 
\q1
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah: 
\q1 He is their help and their shield. 
\q1
\v 11 Ye that fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah: 
\q1 He is their help and their shield. 
\q1
\v 12 Jehovah hath been mindful of us; he will bless \add us\add*:
\q1 He will bless the house of Israel; 
\q1 He will bless the house of Aaron. 
\q1
\v 13 He will bless them that fear Jehovah, 
\q1 Both small and great. 
\q1
\v 14 Jehovah increase you more and more, 
\q1 You and your children. 
\q1
\v 15 Blessed are ye of Jehovah, 
\q1 Who made heaven and earth. 
\q1
\v 16 The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah; 
\q1 But the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
\q1
\v 17 The dead praise not Jehovah, 
\q1 Neither any that go down into silence; 
\q1
\v 18 But we will bless Jehovah 
\q1 From this time forth and for evermore. 
\q1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\c 116  
\q1
\v 1 I love Jehovah, because he heareth 
\q1 My voice and my supplications. 
\q1
\v 2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,

\q1
\v 3 The cords of death compassed me, 
\q1 And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: 
\q1 I found trouble and sorrow. 
\q1
\v 4 Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: 
\q1 O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
\q1
\v 5 Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; 
\q1 Yea, our God is merciful. 
\q1
\v 6 Jehovah preserveth the simple: 
\q1 I was brought low, and he saved me. 
\q1
\v 7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; 
\q1 For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
\q1
\v 8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, 
\q1 Mine eyes from tears, 
\q1 \add And\add* my feet from falling. 
\q1
\v 9 I will walk before Jehovah 
\q1 In the land of the living. 
\q1
\v 10 I believe, for I will speak: 
\q1 I was greatly afflicted: 
\q1
\v 11 I said in my haste, 
\q1 All men are liars. 
\q1
\v 12 What shall I render unto Jehovah 
\q1 For all his benefits toward me? 
\q1
\v 13 I will take the cup of salvation, 
\q1 And call upon the name of Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 14 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, 
\q1 Yea, in the presence of all his people. 
\q1
\v 15 Precious in the sight of Jehovah 
\q1 Is the death of his saints. 
\q1
\v 16 O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: 
\q1 I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; 
\q1 Thou hast loosed my bonds. 
\q1
\v 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, 
\q1 And will call upon the name of Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 18 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, 
\q1 Yea, in the presence of all his people, 
\q1
\v 19 In the courts of Jehovah’s house, 
\q1 In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. 
\q1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\c 117  
\q1
\v 1 O praise Jehovah, all ye nations; 
\q1 Laud him, all ye peoples. 
\q1
\v 2 For his lovingkindness is great toward us; 
\q1 And the truth of Jehovah \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1 Praise ye Jehovah. 
\c 118  
\q1
\v 1 Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;

\v 2 Let Israel now say, 
\q1 That his lovingkindness \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 3 Let the house of Aaron now say, 
\q1 That his lovingkindness \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 4 Let them now that fear Jehovah say, 
\q1 That his lovingkindness \add endureth\add* for ever. 
\q1
\v 5 Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah: 
\q1 Jehovah answered me \add and set me\add* in a large place. 
\q1
\v 6 Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear: 
\q1 What can man do unto me? 
\q1
\v 7 Jehovah is on my side among them that help me: 
\q1 Therefore shall I see \add my desire\add* upon them that hate me.
\q1
\v 8 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah 
\q1 Than to put confidence in man. 
\q1
\v 9 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah 
\q1 Than to put confidence in princes. 
\q1
\v 10 All nations compassed me about: 
\q1 In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 
\q1
\v 11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: 
\q1 In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 
\q1
\v 12 They compassed me about like bees; 
\q1 They are quenched as the fire of thorns: 
\q1 In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off. 
\q1
\v 13 Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; 
\q1 But Jehovah helped me. 
\q1
\v 14 Jehovah is my strength and song; 
\q1 And he is become my salvation. 
\q1
\v 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous:
\q1 The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly. 
\q1
\v 16 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted: 
\q1 The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly. 
\q1
\v 17 I shall not die, but live, 
\q1 And declare the works of Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 18 Jehovah hath chastened me sore; 
\q1 But he hath not given me over unto death. 
\q1
\v 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: 
\q1 I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah. 
\q1
\v 20 This is the gate of Jehovah; 
\q1 The righteous shall enter into it. 
\q1
\v 21 I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me, 
\q1 And art become my salvation.

\v 22 The stone which the builders rejected 
\q1 Is become the head of the corner. 
\q1
\v 23 This is Jehovah’s doing; 
\q1 It is marvellous in our eyes.

\v 24 This is the day which Jehovah hath made;
