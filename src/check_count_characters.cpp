Paratext can find invalid characters, but as we have Unicode, where all

Diacritics usage in Paratext. It shows all character sequences that have
diacritics, how many times each sequence occurs, and the reference where it
occurs. We don't use it as we have Unicode, and that views diacritics as any
other character.
