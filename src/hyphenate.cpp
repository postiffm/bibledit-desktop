#include "hyphenate.h"

/*
 Some information about hyphenation follows below:

 The entity for a nonbreaking hyphen is as in these names:
 's&#8209;Gravenhage or 's&#x2011;Gravenhage.

 There are hyphenation files available from Tex/LaTex, with rules in them.
 But bibledit does not use them.

 There are soft hyphen characters (U+00AD) (&#173;) to mark possible
 hyphenation points.

 Unicode has a non-breaking hyphen character - &#x2011; - This is &#8209;.
 There is also the normal hyphen, &#8208;.
 This can be used in combination with the soft hyphen, so it only breaks once.
