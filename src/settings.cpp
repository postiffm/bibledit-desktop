Before this we used to retrieve every setting from the databases,
every time it was needed.
This made bibledit sluggish in cases where many values were needed at once.
This new object is a much faster, in-memory, system for the settings.
It loads a value the first time it is requested,
and then keeps it in memory for the rest of the time.
It will write the values back to disk on object destruction.
[MAP: This last statement is true, but it is not good design. There
should be a save_settings routine that is called explicitly, and object
destruction should not save any settings, because we don't know when that
routine will be called relative to all other object destructions, if at all
(i.e. if the program terminates early).
