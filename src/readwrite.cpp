void read_write_data(int argc, char *argv[], bool read, bool write)
/*
Read or writes data to or from a Bible / project.

Bibledit-rdwrt can read from or write to Bible data.

Syntax: bibledit-rdwrt -r|-w project book chapter|0 fileName

Breaking the syntax down we have:

First parameter: -r|-w
This can be either -r or -w which determines whether the remaining arguments are
going to do a "read" operation
from the specified Bibledit-Gtk Bible / project, or do a "write" operation to
that Bible / project.

Second parameter: project
This gives the name of the Bibledit-Gtk Bible / project.
All we have to do is ensure that the project name we want to access is a
valid/existing one.

Third parameter: book
This is simply the 3-letter book code for the Bible book that is being
read/written to.
I.e., MAT for Matthew, GEN for Genesis, etc.

Fourth parameter: chapter|0
This can be either a chapter number or 0 (zero) for reading/writing either an
individual chapter
or reading/writing a whole book (when the parameter is 0).

Fifth parameter: fileName
This is a temporary file name that we assign for our use with bibledit-rdwrt.
For a read (-r) operation this fileName argument is the name of the file that
will be created by bibledit-rdwrt
containing a copy of the whole book (corresponding to the 3-letter code),
or that contains the individual chapter contents (of a designated chapter) of an
existing Bibledit-Gtk book file
in the Bible / project. It should be prefixed with a path us.
Since bibledit-rdwrt is a console operation, after AdaptIt calls it using
::wxExecute,
it would need to read the resulting temporary file to grab the contents for its
use.
For a write (-w) operation this fileName argument is the name of the temporary
file that bibledit-rdwrt reads
to get the text which it then writes to the appropriate Bible / project file.
The temporary file can contain the text of a whole book, or just the text of a
single chapter
for the book specified by the book 3-letter code and the chapter (number)
argument.

bibledit-rdwrt may exit with 0 on success, or -1 on failure, as it sees fit.
It may write to stdout or stderr, as it sees fit.
