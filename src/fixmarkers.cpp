Using Check / Marker / Validate in CEV, John 1:5 has:
\q1\x - \xo 1.6: \xt Mt 3.1; Mk 1.4; Lk 3.1,2.\x*
and BE complains about the unknown USFM \q1\x.
Same with John 4:45:
\p\x - \xo 4.45: \xt Jn 2.23.\x*
And John 15:20:
\pi\x - \xo 15.20: \xt Mt 10.24; Lk 6.40; Jn 13.16.\x*
The text given violates the USFM 2 standard, and therefore bibledit
correctly complains about it.

This tool inserts a space after an opening marker that is not followed by
a space.
But after a closing marker it does not insert spaces, because the * is enough.
