# This takes input from USFM and extracts the refs and finds all the
# ways that books are referred to. This helps us to find errors in
# \toc3 entries so that Scripture App Builder can know the correct
# references. An unintended side-effect is that it also helps find
# inconsistent ways that books are referenced (1 Sam versus I Sam,
# for example), and wrong spacings. 

# Do a grep first to extract just the lines we want, and run
# like this:
# grep '\\r' *.usfm | ~/bibledit-desktop/linux/distillRefs.pl
# The grep allows us to be a little sloppy below, not checking for
# blank lines or lines with no interesting USFM like \r or \rq...\rq*

# First use for Rito NT. 
# Then adapted for Quechua which had a slightly different reference
# style (periods after book names, and some other peculiarities.

# Update 8/19/2020: encountered new usfm \rem, which starts with \r
# and affects the parser below.
