The features that you feel Bibledit-Gtk ought to have become todo items.

I'd like to put out a call for patches implementing the todo items.


These are bug fixes or speed enhancements or features that we believe
are worthy of someone's attention to improve bibledit-gtk. For
additional information, please contact Pastor Matt Postiff
<postiffm@umich.edu> or Birch Champeon <birch@birchandconnie.com>.

Roughly in order of priority

Date Added Description
5/16/2024 Cannot open file /home/postiffm/bibledit/share/bibledit-desktop/bibles/bi.crf
	Need to redo how we install the bibles and shared resources. I can't remember
	how to do this, but I have removed bibles/ from the distribution, and I plan
	to remove BiblesInternational from there as well and have it as a separate 
	repo. Same with open_bible_info.crf
	Fixed crash in this case 5/17/2024.
1/12/2015  Fix Settings:: and ProjectConfiguration:: to have a "SaveSettings"
	   routine or some such so that they do NOT save state in their 
	   destructors.
1/12/2015  Keyterms and related verses window is VERY slow to update when you
	   change verses.
1/12/2015  Fix Mappings::original2me because it takes a lot of time.
1/13/2015  On my system, every other time Bibledit runs, it hangs up during
	   startup for some reason. If I kill it and start over, it works.
	   That is not appropriate behavior to our end user. The error /may/
	   have to do with the following errors found in 
	   /tmp/bibledit/bibledit.log:
	   Could not find program "xetex". Install package texlive-xetex to resolve this.
	   Could not find program "php". Install package php5-cli to resolve this.
	   Webserver Access: Cannot connect to destination (localhost)
	   Verified that the error is not due to the first two problems. Once I installed
	   those, the errors go away, but the hang-up problem remains intermittently
	   upon startup.
1/13/2015  When shared resource directory is wrong/gone, Bibledit fails 
	   without any warning message. It would be nice if /share/bibledit
	   does not exist, for example, that the program pops up an error
	   window to tell the user what is going on. Of course this symptom
	   means that the program was not built or configured properly, but
	   it would still be nice :-)
1/13/2015  Fix #pragma warning in Windows compile
1/13/2015  Fix duplication #define of WIN32 in Windows compile, probably by
	   protecting the definition in config.h.in.
1/13/2015  It is not clear that gtk/config.h should be tracked in git
           because it changes with every ./configure call. Probably only
	   config.h.in should be tracked.
