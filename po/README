To create a new version of bibledit.pot, do this:

xgettext -k_ ../src/*.cpp -o test.pot
xgettext -j --language=glade ../templates/gtkbuilder.*.xml -o test.pot

and then, if you are creating a refreshed copy of an old bibledit.pot,
check test.pot against the old bibledit.pot to see if everything looks
right.

The problem with the above approach is that it blasts the header of
the bibledit.pot file, which includes copyright and other niceties.  I
am not aware of switches to xgettext that will fill all this
information for you. So, from your old bibledit.pot, copy the top
lines of information from it to the new file.

Once you are happy with the diff of test.pot and bibledit.pot, then do
this:

mv test.pot bibledit.pot
git commit -a -m "Updated bibledit.pot to new sources."

Now, that is the "portable object template (.pot)." But you also have to
update the language files, that is, the .po files. So, for French, do this:

cp fr.po fr.po.bak
msgmerge fr.po bibledit.pot
compare fr.po.bak with the new fr.po and see if you like the changes.
If so,
git commit -a -m "Updated French translation file to match new sources. Now we need to update the translations."
