To create a new version of bibledit.pot, do this:

xgettext -k_ ../src/*.cpp -o test.pot
xgettext -j -k_ ../git/*.cpp -o test.pot
xgettext -j -k_ ../shutdown/*.cpp -o test.pot
xgettext -j --language=glade ../templates/gtkbuilder.*.xml -o test.pot

(run these commands by doing sh ./getStrings.sh)

and then, if you are creating a refreshed copy of an old
bibledit-desktop.pot, check test.pot against the old one to see if
everything looks right.

The problem with the above approach is that it blasts the header of
the bibledit.pot file, which includes copyright and other niceties.  I
am not aware of switches to xgettext that will fill all this
information for you. So, from your old bibledit.pot, copy the top
lines of information from it to the new file.

Once you are happy with the diff of test.pot and bibledit.pot, then do
this:

mv test.pot bibledit-desktop.pot
git commit -a -m "Updated bibledit-desktop.pot to new sources."

Now, that is the "portable object template (.pot)." But you also have to
update the language files, that is, the .po files. So, for French, do this:

msgmerge fr.po bibledit-desktop.pot > fr.po.new
compare fr.po.new with the old fr.po and see if you like the changes.
If so,
mv fr.po.new fr.po
git commit -a -m "Updated French translation file to match new sources. Now we need to update the translations."
