	The ChangeLog file was scarcely updated. git history tells all the details.

	I will try to move DONE items from the TODO file into this file.

    Error opening file /home/postiffm/bibledit/share/bibledit-desktop/bibles/bi.crf
	Need to redo how we install the bibles and shared resources. I have removed 
	bibles/ from the distribution, and I plan to remove BiblesInternational from it 
	as well and have it as a separate repo that has the xref and .crf files.
	Fixed crash in this case 5/17/2024.
	Done moving bibles and BiblesInternational 5/18/2024.
