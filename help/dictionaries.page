        There are various types of dictionaries that can be added.
      </p>
      <p>
        - "Project &lt;project name&gt; Shared Dictionary. This dictionary belongs to a project. It is called "shared", because if <link xref="collaboration">collaboration</link> is used, the dictionary is shared with other workstations.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Dictionaries that have two-letter names, such as "en", "he", "en_ZW", and so forth. These are dictionaries that are installed on your system. Bibledit does not know what these abbreviations mean. Some of them can be guessed. It depends entirely on which dictionaries you have installed on your system.
      </p>
      <p>
        - "Global Dictionary". This is one global dictionary provided by Bibledit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Button "Sort, remove duplicates" does what it says, it sorts all the words in the order that the dictionary engine would order them, and it removes any duplicates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can import words from another dictionary, or export them to another dictionary.
      </p>

      <p>
        If spelling of text is to be checked, Bibledit consults all the dictionaries that are in the list. It starts from the top one, and works to the bottom, in order to find the word. If you wish to use another order, you can drag a dictionary to another position.

    <section id="sytem"><title>System dictionaries
      </title>
      <p>
        Bibledit accesses the dictionaries through Enchant. Enchant supports a variety of spelling check programs. It supports Aspell, Hspell, Ispell, MySpell, and so forth. Any dictionaries installed on your system for these spelling checkers will become available to Bibledit through Enchant. For example, if Dutch spelling checking is desired using Aspell, then a package like with a name like "aspell-nl" should be installed. Once done, this language is available.
