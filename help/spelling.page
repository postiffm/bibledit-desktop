  <title>10. Spelling</title>
<p>
        Bibledit includes a spelling checker. If a word is misspelled, it will be underlined in red. If the user clicks on that word with the right button of the mouse, a menu appears that allows the user to handle this word.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is basically all what it involves. A more detailed description follows below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spelling checking is switched on or off in the <link xref="project#projectproperties">Project properties dialog</link>. If "Check spelling" is ticked, then the spell checker is switched on, else it is off. When switching the spelling checker on, and if there are no dictionaries added yet to use, then naturally all words are considered misspelled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding dictionaries is done in the same dialog. Button "Dictionaries" gives access to all available dictionaries on the system. If that button is clicked, then a dialog "Dictionaries" opens. <link xref="dictionaries">More help is available about this</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a word is misspelled, and the user clicks on it with the right button of the mouse, then a menu with Spelling suggestions opens. These give possible corrections for the word. If one such suggestion is chosen, then the word will be replaced with that suggestions. It also is possible to add the misspelled word to the dictionary. It will be added to the first editable <link xref="dictionaries">dictionary in the list of dictionaries</link>. Another option is to Ignore all. This means that for this session the misspelled word is ignored.
