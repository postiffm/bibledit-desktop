	<section id="generalnotes">
<title>General </title>
      <p> During the process of translation many notes will be made that
        related to the project. </p>
      <p> Project notes are stored in a database, and are independent of
        any Bible text. That is, whichever project is opened or closed,
        the notes remain the same. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="creatingnotes">
<title>Creating and
        editing project notes </title>
     <p> To make a new project note press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>N</key></keyseq>. </p>
      <p> To edit an existing project note click on the blue
        reference(s) for that note. </p>
      <p> When creating a new note or editing an existing one, the
        project notes window splits up into two so as to make space for
        a couple of controls. </p>
      <p> Project notes can be deleted by clicking on the blue [delete]
        link. </p>
      <p> Some keyboard shortcuts help while editing notes. An example
        will show how: The user edits the text of a project. To make a
        new note, he presses <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>N</key></keyseq>. He types some text in the note. If
        he wishes to change to category of the note, he presses <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>A</key></keyseq>,
        then Enter to open the list of categories, then he makes a
        selection with Up Arrow or Down Arrow and presses Enter to
        confirm the selection. If he wishes to add some references, he
        pressed <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>R</key></keyseq> and types some references. <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>O</key></keyseq> saves the note,
        and takes the user back to where he was editing the text. <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>I</key></keyseq>
        puts the text in italics, <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>B</key></keyseq> makes it bold, and <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>U</key></keyseq>
        underlines it. </p>
      <p> When a project note is being edited, the creator of the note
        can be retrieved through menu <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>More</gui></guiseq> information on current
        note. Other information about this note is visible there as
        well, like the date it was created, and when it was edited. </p>
      <p> Each note falls into a category. The various categories and
        the default category can be set in the <link xref="projectnotes">preferences</link>.

<title>Finding project notes </title>
      
      <p> Menu <guiseq><gui>Edit</gui><gui>Find</gui></guiseq> in Project notes (<keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>E</key></keyseq>, N) allows to do
        Simple searches in the Project notes. </p>
      <p> This tool searches exacty (except case sensitive) for the
        sequence of characters entered into the "Search for" box,
        punctuation marks and spaces included. Case sensitive can be
        switched on or off. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="navigating">
<title>Navigating
        to the references of a note </title>
      <p> Project notes usually have one reference. This is the one for
        which the note was created. But additional references can be
        added as well. </p>
      <p> These references are shown attached to each note. </p>
      <p> There are two ways to get these notes into the references
        window. </p>
        <steps>
        <item>
      <p>Open a note to edit it. In the menu choose <keyseq><key>Edit</key><key>Get
        references from project note</key></keyseq>. </p></item>
        <item>
      <p>Click on the blue word [references] of a note. </p></item>
      </steps>
      <p> As a result the references will be loaded in the references
        window. Once there they can be activated and the text belonging
        to that reference will appear in the text editor. </p>

	<section id="transfering">
<title>Transferring
        text from the text editor into the project notes </title>

      <p> Many people have one project with the actual text, and a
        separate project for their project notes. There is a historical
        reason for doing so. This separate project may have checking
        questions, answers from native helpers, a history of different
        renderings, commentary support, notes following consultant
        checks, and so on. </p>
      <p> It would be a lot of work to copy and paste these notes into
        the project notes one verse at a time. </p>
      <p> The tool "Transfer text to project", under the Tools menu,
        helps you with this. </p>
      <p> It transfers all text that is in the currently opened project
        into the project notes. </p>
      <p> It takes a good while to do this. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="noteschapter">
<title>Notes overlapping
        chapters </title>
       <p> If project notes need to overlap the chapter boundaries, the
        reference can be manually entered like, for example: Luke
        2:2-3:3. Bibledit will divide this into two parts: Luke 2 verse
        2 to the end of the chapter, and Luke 3 verse 1 to 3. </p>

	<section id="exportingnotes">
<title>Exporting note</title>
      <p> Project notes can be exported into some formats. </p>
      <list>
      <item><p>Bibledit Notes version 3. This is the format used by the
        current version of Bibledit. In other words, notes exported
        through this option can be imported in Bibledit. </p></item>
      <item><p>ScriptureNotes version 2.0. Notes exported in this format
        can be imported by Translation Notes Editor 6.0. </p></item>
        </list>
<p> To see how these formats looks, just export some text and open
        the exported text in a text editor. </p>
         
	</section>

	<section id="sharingnotes">
<title>Sharing notes </title>
      <p> The notes that you make on your computer can be shared with
        other members of the team. These notes you make will then also
        be available to the members of the team, and the notes made by
        any member of the team will also become available to you.</p>
    <p> You can set the sharing up through the <link xref="remote">Remote
          Repository Assistant</link>. Normally this assistant sets up
        project sharing. But it can also set up notes sharing. Just make
        the appropriate selection at the start of the assistant. It will
        be good to read the entire section about <link xref="collaboration">Collaboration</link> if
        you need to set it up, since it fully explains the technical
        details. </p>
      <p> Notes are stored in flat files, but selected from an index. If
        the index for some reason gets corrupted or out of sync, then
        you can recreate it by either deleting the index manually from
        directory <file>~/.bibledit/notes</file> and then restarting Bibledit, or by
        setting the sharing up again through the remote repository
        assistant. </p>
      <p> Menu <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Project notes</gui><gui>Send / Receive</gui></guiseq> to a manual sync of
        your notes with the remote repository. Normally the sync is done
        automatically, though, by default it is done every hour, but you
        can change this in the remote repository assistant. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>

     <p> A Bible note is a note that goes in the Biblical text. It can be a
      footnote, or a cross reference, or an endnote.</p>
	</section>  
  
	<section id="insertingbiblenotes">
<title>Inserting</title>
      <p> Bible notes can be inserted manually by applying an
        appropriate note style. For example, if the "f Footnote" style
        is applied, then a <link xref="insertmenu">window</link>
        comes up allowing insertion of this footnote. The same applies
        to endnotes and crossreferences. </p>
	</section>    
	<section id="editingbiblenotes">
<title>Editing</title>
      <p> Bible notes are marked by a asterisk or character in the
        editor. Its text is visible at the bottom of it. </p>
      <p> The asterisk corresponds to no caller (-), the characters to
        automatic callers or a given caller in the text. </p>
      <p> Removing a note works as you would remove any text. </p>
      <p> Notes can be cut and paste in a text (which is only useful in
        the same verse, if a verse-reference (\fr or \xo) is included. </p>
      <p> While editing a note, pressing Page Up takes you back to the
        main body of text, to the place where the footnote starts. </p>
	</section> 
	<section id="printingbiblenotes">
<title>Printing </title>
      <p> If a project is printed, it will show the footnotes, endnotes,
        and crossreferences. Printing a list of references does not. </p>

		<section id="placement">
<title>Placement </title>
      <p> Footnotes and crossreferences normally appear at the bottom of
        the page, inside the column they belong to. </p>
      <p> Endnotes normally are printed at the end of all other text.
        This can be changed in the stylesheet. Edit the style for \fe to
        change that. The other options are to print them at the end of
        each book, or upon encountering a certain marker in the text. </p>
      <p> Placing endnotes upon encountering a certain marker is the
        most flexible option. It allows endnotes to be placed exactly
        where you want them. If this option is switched on, it normally
        places them where marker \zendnotes is found in the text. You
        can insert the \zendnotes anywhere, and notes collected thus far
        will be dumped there. The \zendnotes marker can be repeated as
        often as you wish. The \zendnotes marker needs to be typed by
        hand because it is not in the stylesheet. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="caller">
<title>Caller</title>
      <p> A Bible note has a caller. The style of the caller can be set
        in the markers, see <link xref="usfm">USFM</link>
        under marker \f. For crossreferences set it under marker \x. </p>
      <p> A "+" prints a caller with automatic numbering, a "-" prints
        no caller at all, and any other character prints that character
        as a caller. </p>
      <p> The automatic numbering can be influenced in the stylesheet,
        under marker f for footnotes and under marker x for
        crossreferences. The numbering 1, 2, 3 ... should be clear, and
        the numbering a, b, c ... follows the alphabet, and after
        reaching the z it starts all over again. A user defined
        numbering sequence can be given too. When for example
        Â§â€ * is given there, the numbering goes like Â§,
        â€ , *, Â§, â€ , *, and so forth. Any sequence of
        characters can be used. </p>
      <p> Optionally the automatic numbering can be restarted every
        chapter or book. </p>
      <p> The automatic numbering of endnotes is restarted whenever the
        notes are printed, either at the end of the book, the end of
        everything, or upon encountering a certain marker. See the style
        \fe to set this. </p>
         	 </section>  
	<section id="paragraph">
<title>Paragraph </title>
      <p> For a footnote, the \ft style has a full paragraph setting in
        the stylesheet. Here you can set how the normal footnote
        paragraph is going to look. For a crossreference, set the style
        under marker \xt. </p>
      <p> For a new paragraph in the footnote, the style can be set
        under the \fp marker. </p>
