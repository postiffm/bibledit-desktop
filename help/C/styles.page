<section id="whatstyle"><title>What is a style?
    </title>
      <p>
        Styles mark the parts of discourse that a block of text belongs to, and secondly determine how the text will look when printed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Styles are given in the text with markers, or more fully Unified Standard Format Markers, shortened <link xref="usfm">USFM.</link>
      </p>
      <p>
        Styles are bundled in a stylesheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each project has one stylesheet attached.
      </p>

><section id="howdoaccess"><title>How do I access the style functions?
    </title>
      <p>
        This will be discussed later on this page.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="howtosearch"><title>How do I search for a particular style?
    </title>
      <p>
        If you know which category the style is in, expand that category and locate the style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Else expand all categories through function Expand all, then focus the Styles Area, and start typing the first couple of letters of the style marker (not the style name). The cursor will move to the style you look for. Pressing the up arrow or down arrow will take you to the previous or next category that starts with these letters.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="howtoinsert"><title>How to insert a style?
    </title>
      <p>
        Do it through function Insert.
      </p>
      <p>
        The style will be inserted at the cursor postion.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are styles that have a begin- and end marker, and if a word has been selected, and such a style is chosen, the selected word will be put in that style.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="whatcategories"><title>What are categories?
    </title>
      <p>
        Styles have been divided into categories for better overview. See <link xref="usfm">USFM.</link>
      </p>
      <p>
        The categories can be <link xref="keyboard">expanded or collapsed.</link>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a category called "Other styles". Any styles Bibledit does not know where to put go into this category. If somebody defines his own styles, these styles will go into this category.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="howchange"><title>How can I change something to the styles?
    </title>
      <p>
        To start editing a style, check the Edit mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is a small tick at the left of the Edit mode, like so: âˆš Edit mode, then the mode is checked, else it is unchecked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the Edit mode is on you can start using the editing functions in the menu.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="howcreate"><title>How can I create a new style?
    </title>
      <p>
        Do it through function New.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the style is known in Bibledit's templates, it will fill all the values in for you. The values can be edited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Else, after you've created the new style, edit the style.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="howedit"><title>How can I edit a style?
    </title>
      <p>
        Through function Properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will bring up a window where you can edit this style.
      </p>
      <p>
        The style determines how the text affected by it will look once printed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All styles should speak for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        * Where there is the choice to span two columns, this refers to the two-column layout normally used in a Bible. A major header normally spans these two columns, but a minor header does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        * A paragraph can be a main title, a subtitle, a section heading, a normal paragraph, and so on. At present these settings are used during exporting a project to SWORD.
      </p>

<section id="howdelete"><title>How to delete a style?
    </title>
      <p>
        In the Styles Area, select the style or the styles you wish to delete, and choose the Delete function.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="whatrecently"><title>What are the recently used styles?
    </title>
      <p>
        When a style has been inserted in the text, it will then also be displayed in the category "Recently Used", and will be accessible from there too. A maximum of 30 styles will be displayed. The styles are sorted on usage count, and the most used styles appear at the top of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a style has been inserted in the text, it will then also be displayed in the category "Recently Used", and will be accessible from there too.
      </p>
      <p>
        These recently used styles are attached to the stylesheet. This implies that if another stylesheet is opened, the recently used styles may change.
      </p>
      <p>
        These styles can be deleted. Just select the style or styles you wish to delete, and choose the Delete function. Or select the category itself, and delete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any style is deleted, and this style happens to be in the recently used category, it will be removed from there also.
      </p>
</section>
<section id="stylesheet"><title>Stylesheet
    </title>
      <section id="switchstylesheet"><title>How do I switch to another stylesheet?
    </title>
      <p>
        A stylesheet can be opened through function Stylesheet - Switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new stylesheet will be attached to the project that is open.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="createstylesheet"><title>How do I create a new stylesheet?
    </title>
      <p>
        Choose function Stylesheet - New. <link xref="stylesheet">More information is available</link>.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="renamestylesheet"><title>How do I rename a stylesheet?
    </title>
      <p>
        Choose function Stylesheet - Rename.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="deletestylesheet"><title>How can I delete a stylesheet?
    </title>
      <p>
        Choose function Stylesheet - Delete. A list of available stylesheets comes up. The one currently opened is not shown so that it cannot be deleted by accident. Select a stylesheet and press Ok. The selected stylesheet will be deleted.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="eximportstylesheet"><title>How to export or import a stylesheet?
    </title>
      <p>
        That's done through function Stylesheet - Export or Stylesheet - Import.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stylesheet is exported as a database. This database contains all the individual styles that are in that stylesheet. It asks for a filename, adds the right extension to it, and then saves the file, for example, as "Standard.sql5".
      </p>
      <p>
        This same database can be imported in Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus stylesheets can be shared among users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions that work with styles are used in various ways.
      </p>
