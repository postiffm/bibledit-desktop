<title>How to change the order
        of the books? </title>
      <p> You can fully configure in which order Bibledit-Desktop displays and
        prints the books. This can be done in menu <guiseq><gui>Preferences</gui><gui>Books</gui></guiseq>.
        Drag the books in the order you desire, and then click <guiseq><gui>OK</gui></guiseq> to
        save the settings. </p>

<section id="printtable"><title>How to print a
        table of contents? </title>
      <p> In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table
        of contents for a project consisting of several books. </p>
      <p> The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter.
        Therefore, add this book to the project. </p>
      <p> Each book that should go into the table of contents should
        have a USFM indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each
        book and add the \toc2 marker to it. For example, in the book of
        Genesis, chapter 0 might look like </p>
      <code>\id GEN
\h Genesis
\toc2 Genesis
</code>
      <p> Do this for all the books. </p>
      <p> Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books,
        including Front Matter. The table of contents will be there. </p>

<section id="modifyplace">
<title>How to modify the place where Bibledit-Desktop stores its data?</title>
<p> Normally Bibledit-Desktop stores its data in subdirectory <file>.bibledit</file> of the user's home directory, e.g. in <file>/home/joe/.bibledit</file>.
</p>
<p>If it is desirable to have Bibledit-Desktop store its data elsewhere,
        the solution is simple:</p>
    <steps>
      <item><p>Move the current <file>.bibledit</file> directory to the new directory.</p></item>
     <item><p>Create a symbolic link from <file>.bibledit</file> to that new
        directory. </p></item>
        </steps>
  <p> There is a different way of pointing Bibledit-Desktop to another data
        directory. </p>
<p> Changing is not done from within Bibledit-Desktop, but involves some
        manual work. This is done for the protection of your valuable
        data. To change the data directory to a new location, do the
        following: </p>
      <p> Quit Bibledit-Desktop. </p>
      <p> Open a terminal. </p>
      <p> Type command: </p>
      <code>cd</code>
<p> to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store
        the data on <file>/mnt/server/.bibledit</file> </p>
      <p> Type command:</p>
      <code>mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit</code>
      <p> to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing
        data, this step is not needed.) </p>
<p> Type command:</p>
      <code>touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer</code>
      <p> to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to
        the new data directory. </p>
      <p> Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one
        line in it: <file>/mnt/server/.bibledit</file></p>
      <p> That's it. </p>

      <p> Removing file <file>.bibledit-datafolder-pointer</file> will cause bibledit
        to use the standard datafolder again. </p>
      <p> See also information about the <link
          xref="data">data</link>. </p>
<note style="warning"><p>It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows
        partition. In such cases problems have been observed when
        special characters are used in the project name. </p></note>

<section id="shortcuts"><title>How to move
        about in Bibledit-Desktop using the keyboard? </title>

<section id="versification"><title>How
        to create a custom versification system or language? </title>
      <p> If the versification system or language you need does not come
        with Bibledit, then you can create your own language or
        versification system and add it to Bibledit-Desktop yourself. To do
        that, take an existing versification textfile or language
        textfile from <file>/usr/share/bibledit-desktop</file>, edit it, and save it in
        the <link xref="data">data directory</link>,
        subdirectory templates. </p>
      <note style="note">
      <p> The versification files start with <file>versification_</file>, the mapping
        files with <file>mapping_</file>, and the language files with <file>language_</file>. It
        is important to keep that first bit, else Bibledit-Desktop won't
        recognize the files. </p>
      <p> If the name of a template you added is the same as the name
        one of the templates that come with Bibledit, your template will
        be taken. </p>
      <p> It would be greatly appreciated if you were willing to share
        the files you have created with others. In that way others will
        benefit from the work that you have already done. A good way of
        sharing it with the community is to submit it for inclusion into
        Bibledit. That way it becomes available to others in the next
        release. </p>

<section id="countcrossref"><title>How
        can I count the number of crossreferences in the project? </title>
      <p> This can be done through menu <guiseq><gui>Tools</gui><gui>Bible notes mass update</gui></guiseq>. Tick "Crossreferences", and leave the action to take as
        "Make no changes but give statistics only". After clicking <gui>OK</gui> it
        will give the number of crossreferences in the project.

<section id="outpostproblem"><title>Problem
        when Outpost runs on another host </title>
      <p>When setting up the Outpost to run on another host, in the
        settings dialog, when I type in the name of the host, I get this
        error message: Host &lt;name&gt; cannot be contacted through the
        network. </p>
      <p>Points to check: </p>
      <steps>
      <item><p>Is the hostname you are entering the one set in Windows on
        the other host? </p></item>
      <item><p>Try finding out Windows' IP address, and then pinging it
        from Linux. If that works, enter that IP number in the Outpost
        Setup dialog. </p></item>
      <item><p>If the IP number changes continually, enter a static IP
        number in Windows. </p></item>
      <item><p>Is the Outpost installed and running in Windows? It has to
        be started manually, because Bibledit-Desktop can't start it over the
        network. </p></item>
      <item><p>Be sure that the Windows firewall does not block port 51515
        for incoming connections. </p></item>
      <item><p>Be sure that you have typed the right IP number. It can be
        checked by opening a Command Prompt in Windows, and typing
        "ipconfig". The IP number assigned to the network should
        correspond with the one you entered. </p></item>

<section id="generalquestion"><title>General </title>
	<section id="databasedisk"><title>The
        log says: CRITICAL **: database disk image is malformed </title>
      <p> This message can be either from the text or the notes
        database. It has been seen in cases of malfunctioning hardware,
        such as unreliable memory. The solution is to solve the hardware
        problem first, and restore the text or the notes from a backup.
      </p>
	</section>
	<section id="unsupportedfile"><title>The log says:
        CRITICAL**: unsupported file format </title>
      <p> This is caused by downgrading from a newer version of sqlite3
        to an older version. This may occur when the data is moved from
        a newer version of Linux to an older version. A possible
        solution is to install the newest version of sqlite3 in your
        current system. It will then be able to read your data again. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="wontstard"><title>Bibledit-Desktop won't start anymore
      </title>
      <p> Try starting it from a terminal, and see what happens. In the
        terminal type: </p>
      <code>bibledit --debug
</code>
      <p> If it gives a segmentation fault, then there is a problem in
        your configuration. A simple way to get Bibledit-Desktop running again
        is to delete the file <file>./bibledit/settings</file> and
        <file>./bibledit/configuration/configuration.xml</file>. You will loose all
        your settings, but not your data, and Bibledit-Desktop should start
        again after that. </p>
      <p> If you wish to have this problem solved, before deleting your
        configuration files, make a bug report, pack all your data in a
        gzipped tarball, and attach this file to the <link
          xref="development">bug report</link>. </p>
      <p> To go to the home directory, type </p>
      <code>cd
</code>
      <p> To pack everything in a tarball, type </p>
      <code>tar -cvf bibledit.tar .bibledit
</code>
      <p> Then compress the tarball: </p>
      <code>gzip bibledit.tar
</code>
      <p> The resulting file is named bibledit.tar.gz and can be
        attached to the bug report. </p>
      <p> If the problem is not a segmentation fault, but it shows
        nothing at all, then the bibledit.log file might give a clue. It
        is in the <link xref="data">temporary
          directory</link>. View the logfile to see what went wrong. </p>
      <p> If you try to start bibledit, and a warning comes up that says
        that Bibledit-Desktop is already running, then it means that Bibledit
        already runs somehow. Try switching to that instance of Bibledit
        that already runs. Or reboot. Or else open a terminal and type:</p>
<code>killall bibledit-bin</code>

<section id="frozen"><title>Bibledit-Desktop is frozen.
        How to solve that? </title>
      <p> Question: I am completely stopped in my work. I opened a
        project, but the book of Philemon freezes Bibledit-Desktop completely.
        When restarting it, the screen comes up, but none of the menus
        or buttons work. I cannot scroll. The only button that works is
        the one to exit the program (which brings up a box giving me the
        option to force-quit). </p>
      <p> Answer: You can change the project from the commandline. In a
        terminal, type this: </p>
      <code>bibledit --general-configuration --write --key project --value testproject
</code>
      <p> Next time you start Bibledit, it will open project
        "testproject" - any name will do here. </p>
      <p> To change the whole configuration to default values type: </p>
      <code>bibledit --general-configuration --reset
</code>
</section>
<section id="onlinehelp"><title>The online help does not
        display </title>
      <p> Bibledit's online help depends on Bibledit's internal
        webserver. The helpfiles only work while Bibledit-Desktop is running. If
        you quit Bibledit, online help is not available. </p>
</section>
<section id="fieldworks"><title>FieldWorks
        Language Explorer interferes with Cygwin/X </title>
      <p> When Bibledit-Desktop is running on Windows, FLEx won't start. While
        FLEx runs, Bibledit-Desktop will only start after a long delay due to a
        timeout. It won't have clipboard functionality. The problem is
        being looked into. The current workaround is to start FLEx
        first, and after that Bibledit. Alternatively you can start
        Cygwin's terminal through the Cygwin icon in the Bibledit-Desktop menu,
        and in that terminal type "startx", and then "bibledit". </p>

	<section id="teckitmap"><title>When
        importing data in legacy encoding, can Bibledit-Desktop use a TECkit
        map? </title>
      <p> Bibledit-Desktop uses iconv, the standard utility on Linux to convert
        between various encodings. </p>
      <p> Iconv supports a huge amount of standard encodings. Iconv does
        the same functions as TECkit does. </p>
      <p> Bibledit-Desktop does not at present support a TECkit map, but that is
        going to change in the future. </p>
      <p> At conversion time the user sees how the text is going to
        look, and can change encodings until the result looks right. If
        there are a couple of characters not right, the search/replace
        functionality quickly fixes that. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="howhtml"><title>Bibledit
        produces .pdf output, but how do I get .html files? </title>
      <p> There are a couple of converters on the market, that convert
        .pdf files to .html. Use a search engine and look for "PDF to
        HTML", including the quotation marks. This will give you a
        number of programs to try out. </p>

	<section id="bold"><title>Bold does not show up in
        a printout </title>
      <p> Question: </p>
      <p> Printing a Bibledit-Desktop project to pdf format, using ArialUnicode
        and SIL Doulos for it, I had the following problem: </p>
     <list> <item><p>Feature Bold does not show up, </p></item>
      <item><p>Feature Italics shows up. </p></item></list>
      <p> Trying the same with Open Office Writer and those two fonts, I
        found out, that both do not show up neither in bold nor in
        italics. </p>
      <p> Answer </p>
      <p> SIL Doulos does not have bold. </p>
      <p> Try Charis SIL, that does have bold, and works fine with me. </p>

	<section id="footnotedetached"><title>The
        footnote caller is detached from the word it belongs to </title>
      <p> If the USFM code is properly written, the footnote or
        crossreference caller is always connected to the word it belongs
        to. </p>
      <p> This is an example of proper code: </p>
      <code>Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*
</code>
      <p> The following two examples of code will cause the footnote
        caller to detach from the word it belongs to: </p>
      <p> Example one: </p>
      <code>Joseph was a good man \f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*
</code>
      <p> Note the space between "man" and the "\f". </p>
      <p> Example two: </p>
      <code>Joseph was a good man
\f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*
</code>
      <p> In USFM a new line is equal to a space, hence there is a space
        between "man" and the "\f" here also. </p>
      <p> Many older projects started a new line for each marker, also
        for the footnotes. This needs correction in the current system.
        All note markers (footnotes and cross-references) should not
        start on a new line, but follow immediately the word it belongs
        to (without even a space). </p>
      <p> Note that in newer versions of Bibledit-Desktop the \f ... code for
        footnotes is no longer visible - only the note itself is
        visible. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="footcaller"><title>The footnote
        caller touches the next word </title>
      <p> If the caller at the bottom of the page touches the footnote
        text, then you can increase the left margin of the footnote
        text. In the stylesheet editor, edit the left margin of the
        Text, marker \ft, and if necessary also for the Paragraph Mark,
        marker \fp. </p>
      <p> Same applies to the Crossreferences. Make the setting under
        marker \xt. </p>

<section id="navigationquestion"><title>Navigation
      </title>
	<section id="bart"><title>BART does not scroll
        with Bibledit-Desktop </title>
      <p> There can be various causes for this. </p>
      <p> Cause 1: Has Bibledit-Desktop Windows Outpost been installed? </p>
      <p> Cause 2: Does it say "Windows Outpost: Connected" in the
        logfile? </p>
      <p> Cause 3: When BART runs under Wine, did you install Bibledit
        Windows Outpost in Wine too? Or when you installed BART in
        CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle "win98", did you install the
        Outpost in the same bottle too? The wine installation
        constitutes a separate Windows machine, and each bottle in
        CrossOver Office also constitute each their own Windows
        machines. The system BART uses for scrolling requires that it be
        accessed from the same Windows machine. This means that if you
        installed BART in a certain bottle in CrossOver Office, e.g.
        bottle "win98", then for scrolling to work, the Outpost needs to
        be installed in that same bottle too. </p>
      <p> Cause 4: Did you set BART to receive references? </p>
      <p> Cause 5: If you used CrossOver Office instead of Wine, then
        you need to start the Outpost manually through the CrossOver
        menu. It needs to be started each time before you start
        Bibledit. </p>
	</section>
	<section id="scrolling"><title>Scrolling
        does not work when the Outpost runs on another host </title>
      <p> Some points to check: </p>
      <p> 1. Ensure in the Windows Outpost preferences that Bibledit-Desktop can
        contact the other host. </p>
      <p> 2. Did you start the Outpost manually on the other host?
        Bibledit-Desktop won't be able to start it over the network, hence
        Outpost needs to be started manually. </p>
      <p> 3. Bibledit-Desktop uses port 51515 to contact the Outpost. Ensure
        that this port is opened in your firewall on Windows. If this
        port is closed, Bibledit-Desktop can't communicate with the Outpost. </p>

<section id="exportimportquestion"><title>Export
        / Import </title>
	<section id="swordnotfound"><title>It says that
        the SWORD compiler was not found </title>
      <p> The SWORD compiler is part of the SWORD API. Bibledit-Desktop uses
        this compiler to export a project to SWORD format. </p>
      <p> The most likely problem is that you did not install SWORD from
        source, but from a binary package. Binary packages do not always
        install the compiler. If you install SWORD from source, or
        install the development version of libsword the compiler will be
        installed too. </p>
      <p> The compiler used is a program called osis2mod. If the
        compiler has been installed, but Bibledit-Desktop still cannot find it,
        the problem might be that the compiler has not been installed in
        the program search path. Type </p>
      <code>echo $PATH
</code>
      <p> in a terminal to see the program search path. </p>

<section id="segmented"><title>Segmented
        verses like 1a do not show in SWORD export </title>
      <p> SWORD currently does not support segmented verses, like verse
        1a. To prevent problems Bibledit-Desktop just takes any "a" or "b" out
        from the verse. SWORD needs to be updated to support this. </p>
</section>
<section id="marker"><title>Marker
        «some marker» does not show properly in Sword frontend</title>
      <p> Question: I have used the \mi formatting in the list of names
        in Acts 13:1. The output to BibleTime lists the \mi paragraphs
        on separate lines, but the font is changed from my default font
        for that language, and there is no indenting. Under the form for
        editing the style for \mi, I don't see a place to select the
        font. And the default indenting of each line at 6 mm from the
        left seems right. So is this a problem of what Bibletime can
        display? (That might explain the lack of indenting, but it seems
        that the font should not change.) </p>
      <p> Answer: For any marker, not only the \mi one, the output
        Bibledit-Desktop generates for the Sword compiler can be seen in the <link
          xref="data">temporary directory</link>/sword_osis_input.txt.
        In this case, that of the \mi marker, it can be seen that no
        indenting information is passed to BibleTime, nor any font
        information. </p>
      <p> This implies that the font problem is a problem of BibleTime,
        and that the indenting is not done because it does not get the
        information needed. If somebody knows how to pass indenting
        information to BibleTime, pls. let the programmer of Bibledit
        know and he can put that information in. </p>

	<section id="pango"><title>Pango-WARNING

      </title>
<p> Question: When opening Bibledit-Desktop and project NIV, the logfile
        says "(bibledit:7567): Pango-WARNING **: Error loading GSUB
        table 4097". I'm not sure what the warning means. The project
        goes ahead and opens. </p>
      <p> Reply: This is not an issue with Bibledit, but with the Pango
        library Bibledit-Desktop is using. Most likely you are using a font that
        Pango has a problem with. Problems with Pango can be reported at
        <link href="http://www.pango.org/">www.pango.org</link>.

	<section id="webserver"><title>Webserver: Address
        already in use </title>
      <p> Remark: On starting Bibledit-Desktop sometimes the logfile says
        "Webserver: Address already in use". </p>
      <p> Reply: This happens after Bibledit-Desktop crashed and is restarted
        after that. The internal webserver cannot function properly
        because the previous one is still running. To solve the problem,
        quit and start Bibledit-Desktop once more. It is hoped that as from
        Bibledit-Desktop version 4.1 the internal webserver will have been
        replaced by a proper webserver such as Apache. </p>

      <p> Question: How can I print the digits in Farsi script? </p>
      <p> Answer: According to the USFM standard one can use the \cp
        marker to print a different number for the chapter number. And
        one can use the \vp markup to do the same for the verse. But
        this is not well supported by Bibledit. XeTeX has a "font
        mapping" option that allows a Unicode-Unicode TECkit mapping
        table to be associated with a font; by using such a mapping that
        converts Latindigits to Farsi ones, the \c numbers can be
        printed in the desired numeral system without any special
        preparation needed in the USFM file, and similarly for \v, page
        numbers, cross-references, anywhere you might want to apply it.
      </p>
      <p> To get this to work in Bibledit, the following is important.
        On Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, install package
        "texlive-lang-arab" and font "ttf-sil-scheherazade". The Arab
        package provides the TECkit mapping with the Farsi digits
        conversion, and the font package provides a font that has been
        proven to work with XeTeX. Other fonts might work as well. Once
        these two packages have been installed, open the Farsi text in
        Bibledit, and set the Arabic font in the View menu, so that the
        text in the editor is real Farsi. The press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>P</key></keyseq> to print, and
        choose the option to print via de <gui>pdf2ptx</gui> typesetter. In the
        Print Settings window, choose Options, and switch to the Mapping
        tab. Select file <file>farsidigits.tec</file>. If the Arab package was
        installed properly, then this TECkit mapping will be available
        in folder <file>/usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/polyglossia</file>.
        </p>
        <p>After pressing <gui>OK</gui>, everything should work out well, and after
        some time the Farsi document should show up. It is important to
        choose the "arab" shaping engine, so that the letters and words
        are properly spaced. On Ubuntu there is a package called
        ttf-farsiweb which may have good fonts. A font called Nazli gave
        good results.
