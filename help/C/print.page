        Option "Write the references in the notes in full". This option scans the text to be printed in the footnotes, the endnotes, and the crossreferences. If it finds any references to verses of the Bible, it will include these with the text. For example if there is a crossreference that says "Acts 10.5; 1 Joh. 1:5", then it will include the full text of these verses in that crossreference. This can be useful for checking purposes, whether the crossreferences are correct.
