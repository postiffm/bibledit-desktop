        This backs up really everything Bibledit knows about.

      <p>
        Depending on the amount of data that you have , it may take a good while to create this backup.
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of backup is recommended for safekeeping all your data, and when you'd like to transfer all your data from one computer to the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Bibledit starts, and notices that it has no data, it will ask for a complete backup. A complete backup is one that was made with the "Everything" option.
