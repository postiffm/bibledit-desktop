<title>How to print parallel versions?</title>
      
      <p>
        See the <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>Print</gui></guiseq>, then <gui>Parallel Bible</gui>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The so called <gui>Parallel Bible</gui> contains parallel versions for only one book, and is intended for producing worksheets for use during translations sessions. The members of the team each get a pile of sheets with all relevant versions printed in parallel on it, verse by verse. Without these sheets each member might have a lot of Bibles strewn about him on the desk, but with these sheets things get more compact. And there will still be Bibles enough on the desk, as many Bibles are not available in electronic format, and hence cannot be printed on the worksheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commentaries can also be printed on the worksheets, provided they are available as projects in Bibledit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Parallel Bible will be printed with the currently opened project at the top, and it will print the book that is currently opened. Therefore, to change the first project on the sheets, just open another project, and for changing the book to be printed, just go to another book.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add another project to your Parallel Bible, press the <gui>Add project</gui> button and select the project to be printed. Added projects can be removed with the Remove button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally all parallel verses are kept together on one page for greater readability. Depending on the number of Bibles printed in parallel, this may leave a lot of whitespace at the bottom of the page. To save paper you can uncheck the option in the dialog, so that the parallel verses no longer are kept together and the paper is filled with text to the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set which portion of the text to print. There are two controls that influence this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <gui>Change</gui> button for the portion. This selects which portion to print.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <gui>Include verses 0</gui> checkbox, whether to include the verses 0 from any of the chapters. Verse 0 is anything before verse 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end press button <gui>Ok</gui> to get the Bible in .pdf format.
