  <title>11. Manage Data</title>
    <section id="introductiondata"><title>Introduction</title>
<p> Your data is valuable.
</p><p>
In Linux the directory where Bibledit normally stores all its data is:  <file>.bibledit</file> in the user's home directory, e.g. <file>/home/joe/.bibledit</file>.
</p><p>
On Windows it may be in <file>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\.bibledit</file> or <file>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;.</file>
</p>

<p>
If your data consists of a Bible that you translate, many years of work may have gone into it. It deserves maximum safety.
</p><p>
Bibledit offers a variety of mechanisms that deal with your data.
</p><p>
First there is the mechanism of Backup. A <link xref="#backupdata">backup</link> makes an exact copy of your data and stores it onto some medium.
</p><p>
A <link xref="#restore">Restore</link> is the opposite of a backup. It takes that backup that was made earlier, and restores it into your data.
</p><p>
Then, there's <link xref="#import">Import</link>. It takes data in another format, and adds it to your own data.
</p><p>
Finally, there's <link xref="#export">Export</link>. It is the opposite of an import. It takes your data and exports it into another format.</p>
