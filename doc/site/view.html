        Bibledit shows the outline of the book that is being edited.

        All the headers and titles that are in the book are visible there, with the chapters and verses they start with and end with.

        The header or title that has the cursor will be focused.

        A note must satisfy four conditions to be selected for displaying.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        The first condition to be satisfied is which reference or references the note belongs to.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        The second condition is the date on which the note has been edited.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        The third condition is the category to which the note belongs.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        The fourth condition is the project to which the note belongs.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        For example if you wish to select all the notes in the current chapter that have been edited today, then tick these conditions: "Notes that have the current chapter", and "Notes edited today", and "Notes of category All categories", and "Notes of project any".
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Another example. If you wish to select all the notes that fall in category "For church", then tick these conditions: "Notes that have any verse", and "Notes edited at any time", and "Notes of category For church", and "Notes of project any".

<p class="p">
        "Order center around current reference". When this is ticked, Bibledit makes an attempt to display notes ordered by how close they are to the current reference. That is, for example, if the user display Matthew 10:2, then the notes that are nearest this reference are displayed visibly, and notes further away are moved away a bit.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        "Include in title - project". If this has been ticked, then also the name of the project the note belongs to will be shown in the blue link, in the Notes Area.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        "Text - summary". Only the first few words of the note are displayed. This allows many notes to be displayed in a small space. This is supposed to give a better overview of which notes are available.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        "Text - add text of the references". If this is ticked, Bibledit displays not only the references of the notes, such as Matthew 1:1-2, but it displays the actual text of those references too. This has been found useful in cases that worksheets had to be produced for a team discussing some notes.
