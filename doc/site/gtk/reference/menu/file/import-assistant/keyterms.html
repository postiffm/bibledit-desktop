        Extra keyterms can be imported. This is done through menu File / Keyterms / Import.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file that will be imported has to adhere to certain standards. The various files with keyterms that come with Bibledit show what the format of the textfiles should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several different types of textfiles than can be imported.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. There is the Standard textfile. Samples of this type of file are in the bibledit distribution or are installed in, normally, /usr/share/bibledit-gtk. These files start with "keyterms" and have the "txt" extension. Looking for files like "keyterms*txt" will give them.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. There is the OTKEY.DB file. A file with that name comes with the bibledit distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. There is the KTREF.DB file. A file with that name comes with the bibledit distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. There is the data produced by the <a href="http://www.ktbh-team.org/" rel="nofollow">"Key Terms in Biblical Hebrew" project</a>. This is supported too. It is included with bibledit as KTBH.pbu. If an update is available, you can import it through the Import function. At KTBH they would be very grateful if they could get some user feedback on our data. The KTBH project is still formally under review, and valuable user feedback is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The keyterms will be imported into a collection. This should be a new collection, one that does not yet exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have messed up the keyterms by importing garbage, the collection that was imported can be <a href="../menu-keyterms/delete.html">deleted</a> again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any keyterms that have been added become available after Bibledit has been restarted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any errors can be sent to the Bibledit bug trackers, apart from errors in the database provided by Key Terms in Biblical Hebrew project.
