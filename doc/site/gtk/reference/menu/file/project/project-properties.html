      <p> In this dialog you can set the properties of a project. </p>
      <p> The dialog is accessible through menu File / Project /
        Properties. </p>
      <p> You can change the name of the project. </p>
      <p> By default a project is editable, but you can set it
        non-editable. In that case the project cannot be changed or
        deleted. </p>
      <p> You can add or remove books. </p>
      <p> When adding books, you can either import a book from file, or
        add a book using an empty template. </p>
      <p> You can set the versification system of the project, and the
        language. If the language is set the names of the books of the
        Bible can assume their localized names, instead of the English
        names. Some of the languages may have a localization of the
        numerals also. If this localization is there, the numbers of the
        chapters and verses in the printout change, for example the 1
        may become a ۱. </p>
      <p> You can set that a project depends upon another one, and that
        the dependency runs through a filter. This means that the text
        of the original project is taken, runs through a filter that
        changes the text, and then comes in the current project in the
        new form. This can be useful for creating a diglot. The filters
        can be managed in menu Preferences / Filters. </p>
      <p> There is also a setting for whether to <a
          href="../../../../tutorials/spelling.html">check the spelling</a>
        in the projects. If this option is ticked, then one or more
        dictionaries should be selected through the "Dictionaries"
        button. </p>
