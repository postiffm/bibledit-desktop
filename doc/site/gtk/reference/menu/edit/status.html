        Status </h2>
      <p> This dialog is accessible through the menu / Edit / Status. </p>
      <p> Bibledit supports simple project status reporting. In this
        dialog the status of a project or part of the project can be
        set. </p>
      <p> The dialog consists of four columns. The first one shows all
        the books, the second one shows all the chapters in a particular
        book, and the third one displays all the verse in a particular
        chapter. Finally the last column shows all the tasks that <a
          href="../menu-preferences/planning-setup.html">have been
          defined for the project</a>. </p>
      <p> To mark a particular task as being done for a whole book, just
        select that book in the list, and put a tick in the task. </p>
      <p> To mark a task as being done for just one chapter, select the
        book and the chapter in the list, and put a tick in that task. </p>
      <p> And to mark a task as being done for one verse only, select
        book, chapter, and verse in the lists, and tick that task. </p>
      <p> Notes. </p>
      <p> 1. If a task is checked, it means that it has been done. </p>
      <p> 2. If a task is unchecked, it means that this one has yet to
        be done. </p>
      <p> 3. At times there is another symbol that indicates that the
        task has not been consistently completed. Such a state occurs
        when for example the status of a chapter is displayed, and not
        all the verses of that chapter have a particular task completed.
        Some have, and others don't. </p>
      <p> 4. To set the task that have been done for a range of books at
        once, select the boosk you want, and put tick the task that has
        been done for that book. Tasks can also be set for a range of
        chapters, or a range of verses. </p>
