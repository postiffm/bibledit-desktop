          id="howtoruntwoversionsofbibleditsimultanously"></a>How to run
        two versions of Bibledit simultaneously? </h4>
      <p> As there are some drastic changes between versions, it would
        be helpful to have two different versions running of Bibledit. </p>
      <p> This is possible, but not recommended for production work, as
        they will be overwriting each other's configuration. </p>
      <p> Do it this way. </p>
      <p> Install the newer version according to the instructions. </p>
      <p> When installing the older version, do this: </p>
      <pre>./configure --prefix=/home/joe/older<br>make<br>sudo make install
</pre>
      <p> Then to run the older version, type this: </p>
      <pre>/home/joe/older/bin/bibledit
</pre>
      <p> Joe stands for the user's name. </p>
      <h4> <a name="howtochangetheorderofthebooks" href=""
          id="howtochangetheorderofthebooks"></a>How to change the order
        of the books? </h4>
      <p> You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and
        prints the books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books.
        Drag the books in the order you desire, and then click OK to
        save the settings. </p>
      <h4> <a name="howtomodifytheplacewherebibleditstoresitsdata"
          href="" id="howtomodifytheplacewherebibleditstoresitsdata"></a>How
        to modify the place where Bibledit stores its data? </h4>
      <p> Normally Bibledit stores its data in subdirectory ".bibledit"
        of the user's home directory, e.g. in </p>
      <pre>/home/joe/.bibledit
</pre>
      <p> If it is desirable to have Bibledit store its data elsewhere,
        the solution is simple: </p>
      <p> 1. Move the current .bibledit directory to the new directory.
      </p>
      <p> 2. Create a symbolic link from .bibledit to that new
        directory. </p>
      <p> There is a different way of pointing Bibledit to another data
        directory. </p>
      <p> Changing is not done from within bibledit, but involves some
        manual work. This is done for the protection of your valuable
        data. To change the data directory to a new location, do the
        following: </p>
      <p> Quit bibledit. </p>
      <p> Open a terminal. </p>
      <p> Type command </p>
      <pre>cd
</pre>
      <p> to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store
        the data on /mnt/server/.bibledit </p>
      <p> Type command </p>
      <pre>mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit
</pre>
      <p> to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing
        data, this step is not needed.) </p>
      <p> Type command </p>
      <pre>touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer
</pre>
      <p> to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to
        the new data directory. </p>
      <p> Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one
        line in it: </p>
      <pre>/mnt/server/.bibledit
</pre>
      <p> That's it. </p>
      <p> Removing file .bibledit-datafolder-pointer will cause bibledit
        to use the standard datafolder again. </p>
      <p> See also information about the <a
          href="../4-management/data.html">data</a>. </p>
      <p> Note: It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows
        partition. In such cases problems have been observed when
        special characters are used in the project name. </p>

          id="TOC-How-to-print-a-table-of-contents-"></a>How to print a
        table of contents? </h2>
      <p> In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table
        of contents for a project consisting of several books. </p>
      <p> The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter.
        Therefore, add this book to the project. </p>
      <p> Each book that should go into the table of contents should
        have a USFM indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each
        book and add the \toc2 marker to it. For example, in the book of
        Genesis, chapter 0 might look like </p>
      <pre>\id GEN<br>\h Genesis<br>\toc2 Genesis
</pre>
      <p> Do this for all the books. </p>
      <p> Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books,
        including Front Matter. The table of contents will be there. </p>
      <h4> <a name="howtocreateacustomversificationsystemorlanguage"
          href="" id="howtocreateacustomversificationsystemorlanguage"></a>How
        to create a custom versification system or language? </h4>
      <p> If the versification system or language you need does not come
        with Bibledit, then you can create your own language or
        versification system and add it to Bibledit yourself. To do
        that, take an existing versification textfile or language
        textfile from /usr/share/bibledit-gtk, edit it, and save it in
        the <a href="../4-management/data.html">data directory</a>,
        subdirectory templates. </p>
      <p> Notes. </p>
      <p> The versification files start with versification_, the mapping
        files with mapping_, and the language files with language_. It
        is important to keep that first bit, else Bibledit won't
        recognize the files. </p>
      <p> If the name of a template you added is the same as the name
        one of the templates that come with Bibledit, your template will
        be taken. </p>
      <p> It would be greatly appreciated if you were willing to share
        the files you have created with others. In that way others will
        benefit from the work that you have already done. A good way of
        sharing it with the community is to submit it for inclusion into
        Bibledit. That way it becomes available to others in the next
        release. </p>

      <p> This can be done through menu Tools, then Bible notes mass
        update. Tick "Crossreferences", and leave the action to take as
        "Make no changes but give statistics only". After clicking OK it
        will give the number of crossreferences in the project.<br>

      <p> Reply: When installing it on Windows, install Cygwin first.
        See <a href="../installation/windows.html">Bibledit's Windows
          installation instructions</a>. Then execute all commands from
        within the Cygwin terminal. </p>

          id="thereisnoacceptableccompilerinpath"></a>There is no
        acceptable C compiler in $path </h4>
      <p> This happens when you did not install a C compiler.Installing
        Bibledit from source requires a C compiler. This compiler is
        part of development tools. The installation instructions for
        Linux, or for Macintosh, or Windows, give instructions on how to
        install such development tools. If you follow these
        instructions, the problem will be gone. For example, on Windows,
        you need to install package "gcc" in Cygwin. </p>

          id="doeswinerunaprogramthatisalreadyonmywindowspartition"></a>Problem
        when Outpost runs on another host </h2>
      <p> Q. When setting up the Outpost to run on another host, in the
        settings dialog, when I type in the name of the host, I get this
        error message: Host &lt;name&gt; cannot be contacted through the
        network. </p>
      <p> A. Points to check: </p>
      <p> 1. Is the hostname you are entering the one set in Windows on
        the other host? </p>
      <p> 2. Try finding out Windows' IP address, and then pinging it
        from Linux. If that works, enter that IP number in the Outpost
        Setup dialog. </p>
      <p> 3. If the IP number changes continually, enter a static IP
        number in Windows. </p>
      <p> 4. Is the Outpost installed and running in Windows? It has to
        be started manually, because Bibledit can't start it over the
        network. </p>
      <p> 5. Be sure that the Windows firewall does not block port 51515
        for incoming connections. </p>
      <p> 6. Be sure that you have typed the right IP number. It can be
        checked by opening a Command Prompt in Windows, and typing
        "ipconfig". The IP number assigned to the network should
        correspond with the one you entered. </p>

          href="" id="thelogsayscriticaldatabasediskimageismalformed"></a>The
        log says: CRITICAL **: database disk image is malformed </h4>
      <p> This message can be either from the text or the notes
        database. It has been seen in cases of malfunctioning hardware,
        such as unreliable memory. The solution is to solve the hardware
        problem first, and restore the text or the notes from a backup.

      <h4> <a name="thelogsayscriticalunsupportedfileformat" href=""
          id="thelogsayscriticalunsupportedfileformat"></a>The log says:
        CRITICAL**: unsupported file format </h4>
      <p> This is caused by downgrading from a newer version of sqlite3
        to an older version. This may occur when the data is moved from
        a newer version of Linux to an older version. A possible
        solution is to install the newest version of sqlite3 in your
        current system. It will then be able to read your data again. </p>
      <h4> <a name="bibleditwontstartanymore" href=""
          id="bibleditwontstartanymore"></a>Bibledit won't start anymore
      </h4>
      <p> Try starting it from a terminal, and see what happens. In the
        terminal type: </p>
      <pre>bibledit
</pre>
      <p> If it gives a segmentation fault, then there is a problem in
        your configuration. A simple way to get Bibledit running again
        is to delete the file ./bibledit/settings and
        ./bibledit/configuration/configuration.xml. You will loose all
        your settings, but not your data, and Bibledit should start
        again after that. </p>
      <p> If you wish to have this problem solved, before deleting your
        configuration files, make a bug report, pack all your data in a
        gzipped tarball, and attach this file to the <a
          href="../../community/development.html">bug report</a>. </p>
      <p> To go to the home directory, type </p>
      <pre>cd
</pre>
      <p> To pack everything in a tarball, type </p>
      <pre>tar -cvf bibledit.tar .bibledit
</pre>
      <p> Then compress the tarball: </p>
      <pre>gzip bibledit.tar
</pre>
      <p> The resulting file is named bibledit.tar.gz and can be
        attached to the bug report. </p>
      <p> If the problem is not a segmentation fault, but it shows
        nothing at all, then the bibledit.log file might give a clue. It
        is in the <a href="../4-management/data.html">temporary
          directory</a>. View the logfile to see what went wrong. </p>
      <p> If you try to start bibledit, and a warning comes up that says
        that Bibledit is already running, then it means that Bibledit
        already runs somehow. Try switching to that instance of Bibledit
        that already runs. Or reboot. Or else open a terminal and type
        "killalll bibledit-bin". </p>
      <h4> <a name="bibleditisfrozenhowtosolvethat" href=""
          id="bibleditisfrozenhowtosolvethat"></a>Bibledit is frozen.
        How to solve that? </h4>
      <p> Question: I am completely stopped in my work. I opened a
        project, but the book of Philemon freezes Bibledit completely.
        When restarting it, the screen comes up, but none of the menus
        or buttons work. I cannot scroll. The only button that works is
        the one to exit the program (which brings up a box giving me the
        option to force-quit). </p>
      <p> Answer: You can change the project from the commandline. In a
        terminal, type this: </p>
      <pre>bibledit --general-configuration --write --key project --value testproject
</pre>
      <p> Next time you start Bibledit, it will open project
        "testproject" - any name will do here. </p>
      <p> To change the whole configuration to default values type: </p>
      <pre>bibledit --general-configuration --reset
</pre>
      <h4> <a name="theonlinehelpdoesnotdisplay" href=""
          id="theonlinehelpdoesnotdisplay"></a>The online help does not
        display </h4>
      <p> Bibledit's online help depends on Bibledit's internal
        webserver. The helpfiles only work while Bibledit is running. If
        you quit Bibledit, online help is not available. </p>

          href="" id="fieldworkslanguageexplorerinterfereswithcygwinx"></a>FieldWorks
        Language Explorer interferes with Cygwin/X </h4>
      <p> When Bibledit is running on Windows, FLEx won't start. While
        FLEx runs, Bibledit will only start after a long delay due to a
        timeout. It won't have clipboard functionality. The problem is
        being looked into. The current workaround is to start FLEx
        first, and after that Bibledit. Alternatively you can start
        Cygwin's terminal through the Cygwin icon in the Bibledit menu,
        and in that terminal type "startx", and then "bibledit". </p>

      <p> Bibledit uses iconv, the standard utility on Linux to convert
        between various encodings. </p>
      <p> Iconv supports a huge amount of standard encodings. Iconv does
        the same functions as TECkit does. </p>
      <p> Bibledit does not at present support a TECkit map, but that is
        going to change in the future. </p>
      <p> At conversion time the user sees how the text is going to
        look, and can change encodings until the result looks right. If
        there are a couple of characters not right, the search/replace
        functionality quickly fixes that. </p>

      <p> There are a couple of converters on the market, that convert
        .pdf files to .html. Use a search engine and look for "PDF to

          href="" id="thefootnotecallerisdetachedfromtheworditbelongsto"></a>The
        footnote caller is detached from the word it belongs to </h4>
      <p> If the USFM code is properly written, the footnote or
        crossreference caller is always connected to the word it belongs
        to. </p>
      <p> This is an example of proper code: </p>
      <pre>Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or âkind manâ.\f*
</pre>
      <p> The following two examples of code will cause the footnote
        caller to detach from the word it belongs to: </p>
      <p> Example one: </p>
      <pre>Joseph was a good man \f + \ft Or âkind manâ.\f*
</pre>
      <p> Note the space between "man" and the "\f". </p>
      <p> Example two: </p>
      <pre>Joseph was a good man<br>\f + \ft Or âkind manâ.\f*
</pre>
      <p> In USFM a new line is equal to a space, hence there is a space
        between "man" and the "\f" here also. </p>
      <p> Many older projects started a new line for each marker, also
        for the footnotes. This needs correction in the current system.
        All note markers (footnotes and cross-references) should not
        start on a new line, but follow immediately the word it belongs
        to (without even a space). </p>
      <p> Note that in newer versions of Bibledit the \f ... code for
        footnotes is no longer visible - only the note itself is
        visible. </p>

      <p> If the caller at the bottom of the page touches the footnote
        text, then you can increase the left margin of the footnote
        text. In the stylesheet editor, edit the left margin of the
        Text, marker \ft, and if necessary also for the Paragraph Mark,
        marker \fp. </p>
      <p> Same applies to the Crossreferences. Make the setting under

      <h4> <a name="bartdoesnotscrollwithbibledit" href=""
          id="bartdoesnotscrollwithbibledit"></a>BART does not scroll
        with Bibledit </h4>
      <p> There can be various causes for this. </p>
      <p> Cause 1. Has Bibledit Windows Outpost been installed? </p>
      <p> Cause 2: Does it say "Windows Outpost: Connected" in the
        logfile? </p>
      <p> Cause 3. When BART runs under Wine, did you install Bibledit
        Windows Outpost in Wine too? Or when you installed BART in
        CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle "win98", did you install the
        Outpost in the same bottle too? The wine installation
        constitutes a separate Windows machine, and each bottle in
        CrossOver Office also constitute each their own Windows
        machines. The system BART uses for scrolling requires that it be
        accessed from the same Windows machine. This means that if you
        installed BART in a certain bottle in CrossOver Office, e.g.
        bottle "win98", then for scrolling to work, the Outpost needs to
        be installed in that same bottle too. </p>
      <p> Cause 4: Did you set BART to receive references? </p>
      <p> Cause 5: If you used CrossOver Office instead of Wine, then
        you need to start the Outpost manually through the CrossOver
        menu. It needs to be started each time before you start
        Bibledit. </p>

      <p> View the Logfile in the Help menu to ensure that there is a
        line that says "BibleTime: Connected", and that there are no
        "BibleTime: " lines saying anything wrong. If everything is
        right, then scrolling should occur. </p>
      <p> Bibledit uses "dcop" to send scrolling commands to BibleTime.
        This can be seen working by ticking menu Preferences / Debug.
        Then go to another verse, view the logfile, and see a
        "BibleTime: dcop ..." command there. If this command is there,
        then Bibledit's job has been done, and if there is still no
        scrolling, the problem lies with either dcop or BibleTime. You
        can verify this by executing the dcop command from a terminal
        and see whether BibleTime scrolls, e.g. by typing </p>

      <p> Some points to check: </p>
      <p> 1. Ensure in the Windows Outpost preferences that Bibledit can
        contact the other host. </p>
      <p> 2. Did you start the Outpost manually on the other host?
        Bibledit won't be able to start it over the network, hence
        Outpost needs to be started manually. </p>
      <p> 3. Bibledit uses port 51515 to contact the Outpost. Ensure
        that this port is opened in your firewall on Windows. If this
        port is closed, Bibledit can't communicate with the Outpost. </p>

      <p> The SWORD compiler is part of the SWORD API. Bibledit uses
        this compiler to export a project to SWORD format. </p>
      <p> The most likely problem is that you did not install SWORD from
        source, but from a binary package. Binary packages do not always
        install the compiler. If you install SWORD from source, or
        install the development version of libsword the compiler will be
        installed too. </p>
      <p> The compiler used is a program called osis2mod. If the
        compiler has been installed, but Bibledit still cannot find it,
        the problem might be that the compiler has not been installed in
        the program search path. Type </p>

      <p> This is a bug in the current SWORD compiler. The bug has been

      <p> A workaround is to use the Unicode speech markers, e.g. </p>

      <p> SWORD currently does not support segmented verses, like verse
        1a. To prevent problems Bibledit just takes any "a" or "b" out

      <p> Question: I have used the \mi formatting in the list of names
        in Acts 13:1. The output to BibleTime lists the \mi paragraphs
        on separate lines, but the font is changed from my default font
        for that language, and there is no indenting. Under the form for
        editing the style for \mi, I don't see a place to select the
        font. And the default indenting of each line at 6 mm from the
        left seems right. So is this a problem of what Bibletime can
        display? (That might explain the lack of indenting, but it seems
        that the font should not change.) </p>
      <p> Answer: For any marker, not only the \mi one, the output
        Bibledit generates for the Sword compiler can be seen in the <a
          href="../4-management/data.html">temporary directory</a>/sword_osis_input.txt.
        In this case, that of the \mi marker, it can be seen that no
        indenting information is passed to BibleTime, nor any font
        information. </p>
      <p> This implies that the font problem is a problem of BibleTime,
        and that the indenting is not done because it does not get the
        information needed. If somebody knows how to pass indenting
        information to BibleTime, pls. let the programmer of Bibledit
        know and he can put that information in. </p>

      <p> Reply: This is not an issue with Bibledit, but with the Pango
        library Bibledit is using. Most likely you are using a font that
        Pango has a problem with. Problems with Pango can be reported at

      <p> Reply: This happens after Bibledit crashed and is restarted
        after that. The internal webserver cannot function properly
        because the previous one is still running. To solve the problem,
        quit and start Bibledit once more. It is hoped that as from
        Bibledit version 4.1 the internal webserver will have been
        replaced by a proper webserver such as Apache. </p>

          href="" id="TOC-Printing-numerals-in-a-different-script"></a>Printing
        numerals in a different script </h2>
      <p> Question: How can I print the digits in Farsi script? </p>
      <p> Answer: According to the USFM standard one can use the \cp
        marker to print a different number for the chapter number. And
        one can use the \vp markup to do the same for the verse. But
        this is not well supported by Bibledit. XeTeX has a "font
        mapping" option that allows a Unicode-&gt;Unicode TECkit mapping
        table to be associated with a font; by using such a mapping that
        converts Latindigits to Farsi ones, the \c numbers can be
        printed in the desired numeral system without any special
        preparation needed in the USFM file, and similarly for \v, page
        numbers, cross-references, anywhere you might want to apply it.<br>
      </p>
      <p> To get this to work in Bibledit, the following is important.
        On Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, install package
        "texlive-lang-arab" and font "ttf-sil-scheherazade". The Arab
        package provides the TECkit mapping with the Farsi digits
        conversion, and the font package provides a font that has been
        proven to work with XeTeX. Other fonts might work as well. Once
        these two packages have been installed, open the Farsi text in
        Bibledit, and set the Arabic font in the View menu, so that the
        text in the editor is real Farsi. The press Ctrl-P to print, and
        choose the option to print via de pdf2ptx typesetter. In the
        Print Settings window, choose Options, and switch to the Mapping
        tab. Select file "farsidigits.tec". If the Arab package was
        installed properly, then this TECkit mapping will be available
        in folder
        /usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/polyglossia.
        After pressing OK, everything should work out well, and after
        some time the Farsi document should show up. It is important to
        choose the "arab" shaping engine, so that the letters and words
        are properly spaced. On Ubuntu there is a package called
        ttf-farsiweb which may have good fonts. A font called Nazli gave
        good results.<br>
