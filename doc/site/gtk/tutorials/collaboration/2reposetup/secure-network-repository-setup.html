          going to set up a secure network repository.</span> </h3>
      Doing this on github.com is easy. Create an account there, and
      then create a git repository.If your username is "joe", and your
      password is "pazz", and the repository is "repo", then accessing
      this repository through https works through this URL:<span
        style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt"><font face="courier new,
          monospace">https://joe:pazz@github.com/joe/repo.git</font></span><span
        style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt"><br>
      </span><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">Another type
        of secure git repository can be created on for example s</span><span
        style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6">ourceforge.net.</span>
      <p> <span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">Open an account
          on</span> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/"
          style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt" rel="nofollow">sourceforge.net</a><span
          style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">. We will use the
          username "joe" in this tutorial.</span> </p>
      <p> Register a new project on your personal account page on
        sourceforge.net. Let's call this project "repo2". </p>
      <p> Enable project feature "Git" on this project. This provides
        the repository. </p>
      <p> The next thing is to try whether you can read the repository
        properly. To try that, open a terminal and issue the following
        command: </p>
      <pre>git ls-remote ssh://joe@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2
</pre>
      <p> This command probably will ask for your password, and the
        first time it could ask you whether you want to continue
        connecting. But it should show no errors. If it completes
        without errors, then your secure repository works well. </p>
      <p> The repository that was created in this tutorial has the
        following URL: </p>
      <pre>ssh://user@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2
</pre>
      <p> The users that are going to use this repository need this URL.
        Where it says "user", each user would need to fill in his own
        username.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> Each user will need to open his or her own account on
        sourceforge.net. After that, they need to open an e-mail from
        sourceforge.net and click the link to activate their account.
        Each user needs to be registered as a member of the project, in
        this example, project "repo2". This is so that the user can
        write to the repository.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> So the moderator (or the person to first set up the
        repository) will need to log onto to his account at
        sourceforge.net, </p>
      <ul>
        <li>click on “account” in the upper right,&nbsp; </li>
        <li>choose the projects tab,&nbsp; </li>
        <li>click on the project name,&nbsp; </li>
        <li>then click View all files. </li>
        <li>Now there will be a series of tabs at the top which expand
          if your mouse cursor hovers above them. Go to the last one,
          Project Admin, and click Members. </li>
        <li>Finally! From there you will be add any members who have
          activated their accounts by clicking in the e-mail that was
          sent to them. </li>
        <li> <span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">After this,
            each project member will be able to do the steps in</span> <a
