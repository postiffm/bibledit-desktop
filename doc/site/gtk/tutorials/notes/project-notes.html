      <h1> Project notes </h1>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-General" href="" id="TOC-General"></a>General </h2>
      <p> During the process of translation many notes will be made that
        related to the project. </p>
      <p> Project notes are stored in a database, and are independent of
        any Bible text. That is, whichever project is opened or closed,
        the notes remain the same. </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Creating-and-editing-project-notes" href=""
          id="TOC-Creating-and-editing-project-notes"></a>Creating and
        editing project notes </h2>
      <h3> <a name="creatingandeditingprojectnotes" href=""
          id="creatingandeditingprojectnotes"></a> </h3>
      <p> To make a new project note press Ctrl+N. </p>
      <p> To edit an existing project note click on the blue
        reference(s) for that note. </p>
      <p> When creating a new note or editing an existing one, the
        project notes window splits up into two so as to make space for
        a couple of controls. </p>
      <p> Project notes can be deleted by clicking on the blue [delete]
        link. </p>
      <p> Some keyboard shortcuts help while editing notes. An example
        will show how: The user edits the text of a project. To make a
        new note, he presses Ctrl+N. He types some text in the note. If
        he wishes to change to category of the note, he presses Alt+A,
        then Enter to open the list of categories, then he makes a
        selection with Up Arrow or Down Arrow and presses Enter to
        confirm the selection. If he wishes to add some references, he
        pressed Alt+R and types some references. Alt+O saves the note,
        and takes the user back to where he was editing the text. Ctrl-I
        puts the text in italics, Ctrl-B makes it bold, and Ctrl-U
        underlines it. </p>
      <p> When a project note is being edited, the creator of the note
        can be retrieved through menu View / More information on current
        note. Other information about this note is visible there as
        well, like the date it was created, and when it was edited. </p>
      <p> Each note falls into a category. The various categories and
        the default category can be set in the <a
          href="../../reference/menu/menu-preferences/project-notes.html">preferences</a>.
      </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Finding-project-notes" href=""

      <h3> <a name="findingprojectnotes" href=""
          id="findingprojectnotes"></a> </h3>
      <p> Menu / Edit / Find in Project notes (Alt+E, N) allows to do
        Simple searches in the Project notes. </p>
      <p> This tool searches exacty (except case sensitive) for the
        sequence of characters entered into the "Search for" box,
        punctuation marks and spaces included. Case sensitive can be
        switched on or off. </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Navigating-to-the-references-of-a-note" href=""
          id="TOC-Navigating-to-the-references-of-a-note"></a>Navigating
        to the references of a note </h2>
      <h3> <a name="navigatingtothereferencesofanote" href=""
          id="navigatingtothereferencesofanote"></a> </h3>
      <p> Project notes usually have one reference. This is the one for
        which the note was created. But additional references can be
        added as well. </p>
      <p> These references are shown attached to each note. </p>
      <p> There are two ways to get these notes into the references
        window. </p>
      <p> 1. Open a note to edit it. In the menu choose Edit - Get
        references from project note. </p>
      <p> 2. Click on the blue word [references] of a note. </p>
      <p> As a result the references will be loaded in the references
        window. Once there they can be activated and the text belonging
        to that reference will appear in the text editor. </p>
      <h2> <a
          name="TOC-Transferring-text-from-the-text-editor-into-the-project-notes"

      </h3>
      <p> Many people have one project with the actual text, and a
        separate project for their project notes. There is a historical
        reason for doing so. This separate project may have checking
        questions, answers from native helpers, a history of different
        renderings, commentary support, notes following consultant
        checks, and so on. </p>
      <p> It would be a lot of work to copy and paste these notes into
        the project notes one verse at a time. </p>
      <p> The tool "Transfer text to project", under the Tools menu,
        helps you with this. </p>
      <p> It transfers all text that is in the currently opened project
        into the project notes. </p>
      <p> It takes a good while to do this. </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Notes-overlapping-chapters" href=""
          id="TOC-Notes-overlapping-chapters"></a>Notes overlapping
        chapters </h2>
      <h3> <a name="notesoverlappingchapters" href=""
          id="notesoverlappingchapters"></a> </h3>
      <p> If project notes need to overlap the chapter boundaries, the
        reference can be manually entered like, for example: Luke
        2:2-3:3. Bibledit will divide this into two parts: Luke 2 verse
        2 to the end of the chapter, and Luke 3 verse 1 to 3. </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Showing-notes" href="" id="TOC-Showing-notes"></a>Showing

      <p> The <a href="../../reference/menu/view/project-notes.html">settings
          for which notes to show and how</a> are in the View menu. </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Exporting-notes" href=""
          id="TOC-Exporting-notes"></a>Exporting notes </h2>
      <h3> <a name="exportingnotes" href="" id="exportingnotes"></a> </h3>
      <p> Project notes can be exported into some formats. </p>
      <p> * Bibledit Notes version 3. This is the format used by the
        current version of Bibledit. In other words, notes exported
        through this option can be imported in Bibledit. </p>
      <p> * ScriptureNotes version 2.0. Notes exported in this format
        can be imported by Translation Notes Editor 6.0. </p>
      <p> To see how these formats looks, just export some text and open
        the exported text in a text editor. </p>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Sharing-notes" href="" id="TOC-Sharing-notes"></a>Sharing
        notes </h2>
      <p> The notes that you make on your computer can be shared with
        other members of the team. These notes you make will then also
        be available to the members of the team, and the notes made by
        any member of the team will also become available to you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p> You can set the sharing up through the <a
href="../../reference/menu/menu-preferences/dialog-remote-repository.html">Remote
          Repository Assistant</a>. Normally this assistant sets up
        project sharing. But it can also set up notes sharing. Just make
        the appropriate selection at the start of the assistant. It will
        be good to read the entire section about <a
          href="../../tutorials/collaboration.html">Collaboration</a> if
        you need to set it up, since it fully explains the technical
        details. </p>
      <p> Notes are stored in flat files, but selected from an index. If
        the index for some reason gets corrupted or out of sync, then
        you can recreate it by either deleting the index manually from
        directory ~/.bibledit/notes and then restarting Bibledit, or by
        setting the sharing up again through the remote repository
        assistant. </p>
      <p> Menu File - Project notes - Send / Receive to a manual sync of
        your notes with the remote repository. Normally the sync is done
        automatically, though, by default it is done every hour, but you
        can change this in the remote repository assistant. </p>
