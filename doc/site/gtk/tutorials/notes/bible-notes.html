      <h1> Bible notes </h1>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Introduction" href="" id="TOC-Introduction"></a>Introduction

      </h2>
      A Bible note is a note that goes in the Biblical text. It can be a
      footnote, or a cross reference, or an endnote.<br>
      <h2> <a name="TOC-Inserting" href="" id="TOC-Inserting"></a>Inserting

      </h2>
      <p> Bible notes can be inserted manually by applying an
        appropriate note style. For example, if the "f Footnote" style
        is applied, then a <a
href="../../reference/menu/menu-none/insert-footnote-endnote-crossreference.html">window</a>
        comes up allowing insertion of this footnote. The same applies
        to endnotes and crossreferences. </p>
      <h3> <a name="editing" href="" id="editing"></a>Editing </h3>
      <p> Bible notes are marked by a asterisk or character in the
        editor. Its text is visible at the bottom of it. </p>
      <p> The asterisk corresponds to no caller (-), the characters to
        automatic callers or a given caller in the text. </p>
      <p> Removing a note works as you would remove any text. </p>
      <p> Notes can be cut and paste in a text (which is only useful in
        the same verse, if a verse-reference (\fr or \xo) is included. </p>
      <p> While editing a note, pressing Page Up takes you back to the
        main body of text, to the place where the footnote starts. </p>
      <h3> <a name="printing" href="" id="printing"></a>Printing </h3>
      <p> If a project is printed, it will show the footnotes, endnotes,
        and crossreferences. Printing a list of references does not. </p>
      <h4> <a name="placement" href="" id="placement"></a>Placement </h4>
      <p> Footnotes and crossreferences normally appear at the bottom of
        the page, inside the column they belong to. </p>
      <p> Endnotes normally are printed at the end of all other text.
        This can be changed in the stylesheet. Edit the style for \fe to
        change that. The other options are to print them at the end of
        each book, or upon encountering a certain marker in the text. </p>
      <p> Placing endnotes upon encountering a certain marker is the
        most flexible option. It allows endnotes to be placed exactly
        where you want them. If this option is switched on, it normally
        places them where marker \zendnotes is found in the text. You
        can insert the \zendnotes anywhere, and notes collected thus far
        will be dumped there. The \zendnotes marker can be repeated as
        often as you wish. The \zendnotes marker needs to be typed by
        hand because it is not in the stylesheet. </p>
      <h4> <a name="caller" href="" id="caller"></a>Caller </h4>
      <p> A Bible note has a caller. The style of the caller can be set
        in the markers, see <a href="../../reference/usfm.html">USFM</a>
        under marker \f. For crossreferences set it under marker \x. </p>
      <p> A "+" prints a caller with automatic numbering, a "-" prints
        no caller at all, and any other character prints that character
        as a caller. </p>
      <p> The automatic numbering can be influenced in the stylesheet,
        under marker f for footnotes and under marker x for
        crossreferences. The numbering 1, 2, 3 ... should be clear, and
        the numbering a, b, c ... follows the alphabet, and after
        reaching the z it starts all over again. A user defined
        numbering sequence can be given too. When for example
        Â§â€&nbsp;* is given there, the numbering goes like Â§,
        â€&nbsp;, *, Â§, â€&nbsp;, *, and so forth. Any sequence of
        characters can be used. </p>
      <p> Optionally the automatic numbering can be restarted every
        chapter or book. </p>
      <p> The automatic numbering of endnotes is restarted whenever the
        notes are printed, either at the end of the book, the end of
        everything, or upon encountering a certain marker. See the style
        \fe to set this. </p>
      <h4> <a name="paragraph" href="" id="paragraph"></a>Paragraph </h4>
      <p> For a footnote, the \ft style has a full paragraph setting in
        the stylesheet. Here you can set how the normal footnote
        paragraph is going to look. For a crossreference, set the style
        under marker \xt. </p>
      <p> For a new paragraph in the footnote, the style can be set
        under the \fp marker. </p>
