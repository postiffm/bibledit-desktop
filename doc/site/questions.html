<p class="p"> In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table

<p class="p"> The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter.
        Therefore, add this book to the project. </p>
<p class="p"> Each book that should go into the table of contents should
        have a USFM indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each
        book and add the \toc2 marker to it. For example, in the book of
        Genesis, chapter 0 might look like </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">\id GEN
\h Genesis
\toc2 Genesis</pre></div>
<p class="p"> Do this for all the books. </p>
<p class="p"> Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books,
        including Front Matter. The table of contents will be there. </p>

<div id="modifyplace" class="sect"><div class="inner">
<div class="hgroup"><h2 class="title"><span class="title">How to modify the place where Bibledit stores its data?</span></h2></div>
<div class="region"><div class="contents">
<p class="p"> Normally Bibledit stores its data in subdirectory <span class="file">.bibledit</span> of the user's home directory, e.g. in <span class="file">/home/joe/.bibledit</span>.
</p>
<p class="p">If it is desirable to have Bibledit store its data elsewhere,
        the solution is simple:</p>
<div class="steps"><div class="inner"><div class="region"><ol class="steps">
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Move the current <span class="file">.bibledit</span> directory to the new directory.</p></li>
<li class="steps"><p class="p">Create a symbolic link from .bibledit to that new
        directory. </p></li>
</ol></div></div></div>
<p class="p"> There is a different way of pointing Bibledit to another data
        directory. </p>
<p class="p"> Changing is not done from within bibledit, but involves some
        manual work. This is done for the protection of your valuable
        data. To change the data directory to a new location, do the
        following: </p>
<p class="p"> Quit bibledit. </p>
<p class="p"> Open a terminal. </p>
<p class="p"> Type command: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">cd</pre></div>
<p class="p"> to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store
        the data on <span class="file">/mnt/server/.bibledit</span> </p>
<p class="p"> Type command:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit</pre></div>
<p class="p"> to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing
        data, this step is not needed.) </p>
<p class="p"> Type command:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer</pre></div>
<p class="p"> to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to
        the new data directory. </p>
<p class="p"> Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one
        line in it: <span class="file">/mnt/server/.bibledit</span></p>
<p class="p"> That's it. </p>
<p class="p"> Removing file .bibledit-datafolder-pointer will cause bibledit
        to use the standard datafolder again. </p>
<p class="p"> See also information about the <span class="link"><a href="data.html" title="11. Manage Data">data</a></span>. </p>
<p class="p"> Note: It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows
        partition. In such cases problems have been observed when
        special characters are used in the project name. </p>

<div id="versification" class="sect"><div class="inner">
<div class="hgroup"><h2 class="title"><span class="title">How
        to create a custom versification system or language? </span></h2></div>
<div class="region"><div class="contents">
<p class="p"> If the versification system or language you need does not come
        with Bibledit, then you can create your own language or
        versification system and add it to Bibledit yourself. To do
        that, take an existing versification textfile or language
        textfile from <span class="file">/usr/share/bibledit-desktop</span>, edit it, and save it in
        the <span class="link"><a href="data.html" title="11. Manage Data">data directory</a></span>,
        subdirectory templates. </p>
<p class="p"> Notes. </p>
<p class="p"> The versification files start with <span class="file">versification_</span>, the mapping
        files with <span class="file">mapping_</span>, and the language files with <span class="file">language_</span>. It
        is important to keep that first bit, else Bibledit won't
        recognize the files. </p>
<p class="p"> If the name of a template you added is the same as the name
        one of the templates that come with Bibledit, your template will
        be taken. </p>
<p class="p"> It would be greatly appreciated if you were willing to share
        the files you have created with others. In that way others will
        benefit from the work that you have already done. A good way of
        sharing it with the community is to submit it for inclusion into
        Bibledit. That way it becomes available to others in the next
        release. </p>

        install such development tools. If you follow these

<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">bibledit --debug</pre></div>
<p class="p"> If it gives a segmentation fault, then there is a problem in

        is to delete the file <span class="file">./bibledit/settings</span> and
        <span class="file">./bibledit/configuration/configuration.xml</span>. You will loose all
        your settings, but not your data, and Bibledit should start
        again after that. </p>
<p class="p"> If you wish to have this problem solved, before deleting your
        configuration files, make a bug report, pack all your data in a
        gzipped tarball, and attach this file to the <span class="link"><a href="development.html" title="Development">bug report</a></span>. </p>

<p class="p"> If the problem is not a segmentation fault, but it shows

<p class="p"> If you try to start bibledit, and a warning comes up that says
        that Bibledit is already running, then it means that Bibledit
        already runs somehow. Try switching to that instance of Bibledit
        that already runs. Or reboot. Or else open a terminal and type

<div class="region"><div class="contents">
<p class="p"> Question: I am completely stopped in my work. I opened a
        project, but the book of Philemon freezes Bibledit completely.
        When restarting it, the screen comes up, but none of the menus
        or buttons work. I cannot scroll. The only button that works is
        the one to exit the program (which brings up a box giving me the
        option to force-quit). </p>
<p class="p"> Answer: You can change the project from the commandline. In a
        terminal, type this: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">bibledit --general-configuration --write --key project --value testproject</pre></div>
<p class="p"> Next time you start Bibledit, it will open project

        being looked into. The current workaround is to start FLEx
        first, and after that Bibledit. Alternatively you can start
        Cygwin's terminal through the Cygwin icon in the Bibledit menu,

<p class="p"> If the USFM code is properly written, the footnote or
        crossreference caller is always connected to the word it belongs
        to. </p>
<p class="p"> This is an example of proper code: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or â€œkind manâ€.\f*</pre></div>
<p class="p"> The following two examples of code will cause the footnote

<p class="p"> Example one: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">Joseph was a good man \f + \ft Or â€œkind manâ€.\f*</pre></div>

<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or â€œkind manâ€.\f*</pre></div>
<p class="p"> In USFM a new line is equal to a space, hence there is a space
        between "man" and the "\f" here also. </p>
<p class="p"> Many older projects started a new line for each marker, also
        for the footnotes. This needs correction in the current system.
        All note markers (footnotes and cross-references) should not
        start on a new line, but follow immediately the word it belongs
        to (without even a space). </p>

        CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle "win98", did you install the
        Outpost in the same bottle too? The wine installation
        constitutes a separate Windows machine, and each bottle in
        CrossOver Office also constitute each their own Windows
        machines. The system BART uses for scrolling requires that it be
        accessed from the same Windows machine. This means that if you
        installed BART in a certain bottle in CrossOver Office, e.g.
        bottle "win98", then for scrolling to work, the Outpost needs to
        be installed in that same bottle too. </p>
<p class="p"> Cause 4: Did you set BART to receive references? </p>
<p class="p"> Cause 5: If you used CrossOver Office instead of Wine, then
        you need to start the Outpost manually through the CrossOver
        menu. It needs to be started each time before you start
        Bibledit. </p>

<p class="p"> 3. Bibledit uses port 51515 to contact the Outpost. Ensure
        that this port is opened in your firewall on Windows. If this
        port is closed, Bibledit can't communicate with the Outpost. </p>

<p class="p"> The SWORD compiler is part of the SWORD API. Bibledit uses
        this compiler to export a project to SWORD format. </p>
<p class="p"> The most likely problem is that you did not install SWORD from

        install the development version of libsword the compiler will be

<p class="p"> The compiler used is a program called osis2mod. If the

<p class="p"> Question: I have used the \mi formatting in the list of names
        in Acts 13:1. The output to BibleTime lists the \mi paragraphs
        on separate lines, but the font is changed from my default font
        for that language, and there is no indenting. Under the form for
        editing the style for \mi, I don't see a place to select the
        font. And the default indenting of each line at 6 mm from the
        left seems right. So is this a problem of what Bibletime can
        display? (That might explain the lack of indenting, but it seems
        that the font should not change.) </p>
<p class="p"> Answer: For any marker, not only the \mi one, the output
        Bibledit generates for the Sword compiler can be seen in the <span class="link"><a href="data.html" title="11. Manage Data">temporary directory</a></span>/sword_osis_input.txt.
        In this case, that of the \mi marker, it can be seen that no
        indenting information is passed to BibleTime, nor any font
        information. </p>
<p class="p"> This implies that the font problem is a problem of BibleTime,
        and that the indenting is not done because it does not get the
        information needed. If somebody knows how to pass indenting
        information to BibleTime, pls. let the programmer of Bibledit
        know and he can put that information in. </p>

<p class="p"> Reply: This is not an issue with Bibledit, but with the Pango

        because the previous one is still running. To solve the problem,
        quit and start Bibledit once more. It is hoped that as from
        Bibledit version 4.1 the internal webserver will have been
        replaced by a proper webserver such as Apache. </p>

        numerals in a different script </span></h2></div>
<div class="region"><div class="contents">
<p class="p"> Question: How can I print the digits in Farsi script? </p>
<p class="p"> Answer: According to the USFM standard one can use the \cp
        marker to print a different number for the chapter number. And
        one can use the \vp markup to do the same for the verse. But
        this is not well supported by Bibledit. XeTeX has a "font
        mapping" option that allows a Unicode-Unicode TECkit mapping
        table to be associated with a font; by using such a mapping that
        converts Latindigits to Farsi ones, the \c numbers can be
        printed in the desired numeral system without any special
        preparation needed in the USFM file, and similarly for \v, page
        numbers, cross-references, anywhere you might want to apply it.
      </p>
<p class="p"> To get this to work in Bibledit, the following is important.
        On Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, install package
        "texlive-lang-arab" and font "ttf-sil-scheherazade". The Arab
        package provides the TECkit mapping with the Farsi digits
        conversion, and the font package provides a font that has been
        proven to work with XeTeX. Other fonts might work as well. Once
        these two packages have been installed, open the Farsi text in
        Bibledit, and set the Arabic font in the View menu, so that the
        text in the editor is real Farsi. The press Ctrl-P to print, and
        choose the option to print via de pdf2ptx typesetter. In the
        Print Settings window, choose Options, and switch to the Mapping
        tab. Select file "farsidigits.tec". If the Arab package was
        installed properly, then this TECkit mapping will be available
        in folder
        /usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/polyglossia.
        After pressing OK, everything should work out well, and after
        some time the Farsi document should show up. It is important to
        choose the "arab" shaping engine, so that the letters and words
        are properly spaced. On Ubuntu there is a package called
        ttf-farsiweb which may have good fonts. A font called Nazli gave
        good results.
