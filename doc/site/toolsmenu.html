        Opinions vary on whether origin references in footnotes and crossreferences are useful. Some say that they are useful because they indicate the verse to which the note belongs. Others say that these references are just clutter and that the information is clearer without them.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        A tool is available that can add or remove the origin references of all the Bible Notes in one go.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        See the <span class="link"><a href="usfm.html" title="USFM">USFM</a></span> documentation for footnotes, endnotes and crossreferences for a description of what the origin references are.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        In the dialog, tick what type of notes to affect: footnotes, endnotes, crossreferences, or a combination of them. If you tick "Footnotes", for example, and leave the others unticked, then only the footnotes in your project will be affected.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Then choose the action you wish to take, whether to give statistics only, or whether to add the origin references or to remove them.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        If you add them, you can set how the origin references will look.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Once all settings are made, press OK to process all verses in your project.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Changes that Bibledit will now make cannot be made undone.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Statistics of what has been found and what has been done will be given once through.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Sometimes Bible notes don't have any markers in them at all, they are just plain text. To add the default markers to the note, choose option "Add missing text labels".

        The dialog to generate the word lists is available through the menu, Tools, Generate word lists.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        It generates a general word list, a list of Hebrew words, and one of Greek words.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        It goes through all the data in the project, collects the entries which have been marked, and then inserts the lists at a location defined by the user. Thus it can generate a glossary or topical index.

        There are three possible lists: a general word list, a Hebrew word lists, and a Greek word list.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        For each of these lists there are some options that the user can set:
      </p>
<div class="list"><div class="inner"><div class="region"><ul class="list">
<li class="list"><p class="p">Process word list: whether to process this particular word list.
      </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">Add an asterisk to each entry, see below.
      </p></li>
<li class="list"><p class="p">Add the asterisk only to the first time this particular entry occurs in the section, see below.</p></li>

      </span></h3></div>
<div class="region"><div class="contents"><p class="p">
        Generating word lists is simple assuming that the right markers are already in the data: Just set the options, click button OK, and wait till it is through.
      </p></div></div>
</div></div>
<div id="entries" class="sect"><div class="inner">

<p class="p">
        The word list generator uses the entries that are in the data to collect the words to insert in the list.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        An entry for the general word list is inserted between the \w and the \w* markers. The Hebrew and Greek word lists use similar markers. See the <span class="link"><a href="usfm.html" title="USFM">USFM</a></span> documentation for full details
      </p>
<p class="p">
        When the word list generator runs, it will remove any asterisks (*) that were appended to the word. When the option "Add an asterisk to each word entry" has been selected, it will then add an asterisk after the word. If the option "the first time it occurs in a section" has been selected also, it will only add the asterisk where this particular entry occurs for the first time in the section. In this case, if for example the word "talent" occurs several times in a section, it will be given as "talent*" the first time, with the asterisk, and as "talent" the other times, without an asterisk. The section headings define the size of a section.

<p class="p">
        The lists of words can be inserted once or more than once in the data. The general word list will be inserted between the markers \zopenwordlist and \zclosewordlist. These markers ought to be on a separate line. If this couple of markers occurs in several places, the word lists will be inserted in several places too. If it occurs once, only one list will be generated, and if it does not occur at all, no list will be generated.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Any entries that are already between those markers will be preserved. If there are entries between those markers, and there is no corresponding entry in the text, this entry will be commented out.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        List of usfm markers that indicate the position of a word list:

\zclosewordlist
\zopengreekwordlist
\zclosegreekwordlist
\zopenhebrewwordlist
\zclosehebrewwordlist</pre></div>
<p class="p">
        The markers that open and close a word list will need to be manually typed in the text at the right location. They are not part of the stylesheet.

        Consider the following situation:
      </p>
<p class="p">
        The text contains the following general word list entries: Hallelujah, Rabi, Pentecost.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        At some place of the data, the list should be inserted, but it already contains some entries:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">\zopenwordlist
\p Hallelujah: Praise the Lord
\p Rabi: Teacher
\p Mamon
\zclosewordlist</pre></div>
<p class="p">       After running the word list generator, it will look so:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="contents ">\zopenwordlist
\p Hallelujah: Praise the Lord
\rem Mamon
\p Pentecost
\p Rabi: Teacher
\zclosewordlist</pre></div>
<p class="p">Note the following: (1) the existing entries have been preserved, (2) a new one has been added, (3) one has been commented out, and (4) the entries have been sorted alphabetically.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        Note also that any text before the first colon (:) is considered to be the actual entry. If there is no colon, then the whole text will be considered the entry.

<p class="p">
        The tool can be accessed through menu <span class="guiseq"><span class="gui">Tools</span> ▸ <span class="gui">Transfer project notes to text</span></span>.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        This tool does only one thing. It copies the project notes into the currently opened project.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        It does that by going through each verse of the project that is now opened in the editor. At each verse it looks at which project notes would display if that verse were visible in the editor. It then copies the text of those notes into the text of the project. It the text of a note is copied into the project, it does not overwrite the data that is already in the project, but it just appends it.
      </p>
<p class="p">
        This tool can be useful in cases that somebody wishes to have some way of printing a subset of project notes along with the text, so that checking questions could be printed on the same page as the verses they refer to. To do this, the notes can be imported in some temporal project, and then a "Parallel Bible" could be created that includes that temporal project that now contains the notes.
