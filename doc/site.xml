<p>The code is stored in a git repository. The repository is accessible from
the <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit" rel="nofollow">Savannah Project
Page</a>. To view the code on the web, click on "Source Code" - and then
"Browse Sources Repository" just below "Use Git". To use the repository in
another way, click on "Source Code" - "Use Git". It will give some information
there.</p>
<p>The code can be checked out from the repository. This code gives the
latest versions of the Bibledit suite or programs. The code has not been thoroughly tested, but is
supported.</p>
<p>To get the most recent code, do the following in a terminal.</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/bibledit</pre>
<p>The above command clones the code repository to your local disk. It will
create a directory called "bibledit". Go into that directory, go into directory "gtk" for bibledit-gtk, or into directory "web" for bibledit-web. Then do the normal
"./configure", "make", "sudo make install" sequence, as is described in the <a href="./site/gtk/installation.html" target="_blank">installation documentation for bibledit-gtk</a> and the <a href="http://bibleconsultants.dyndns.org/bibledit-web-demo/help/installation.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">installation documentation for bibledit-web</a>..</p>
<p>Note 1. If you are installing development versions often, to save bandwidth, it is possible to leave the directory
"bibledit", created above, as it is. If that directory is left there, then next
time there is no need to clone the whole repository. Just pulling the changes
is enough:</p><pre><span style="font-family:Arial,Verdana,sans-serif;white-space:normal"><pre>$ cd bibledit
$ git reset --hard
$ git pull</pre><pre><span style="font-family:Arial,Verdana,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6;white-space:normal">Continue installation from here...</span>
</pre></span></pre><p><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">Note 2. For best results close Bibledit-Gtk while installing the new version. This does not apply to Bibledit-Web.</span></p>
<h3><a name="helpneeded"/>Help needed</h3>
<p>Help in developing Bibledit is welcome.</p>
<p>* Do you like writing good documentation? Your help is welcome to maintain
the helpfiles of Bibledit.</p>
<p>* You know how useful packages are? Making packages could be the thing you
would like to help with.</p>
<p>* Are you good at testing? Your feedback is welcome and suggestions for new
features too.</p>
<h3><a name="bugsandfeaturerequests"/>Bugs and feature requests</h3>
<p>Savannah.nongnu.org provides resources for developing Bibledit. The <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit" rel="nofollow">Savannah Project Page</a>
is the central point from where all these resources can be accessed.</p>
<p>To report a problem go to the <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit" rel="nofollow">Savannah Project Page</a>,
and click on "Bugs". A list of open bugs will show, and you can see whether
your bug has been reported already. If not, click "Bugs" - "Submit", fill in
the screen with detailed information on when the bug occurs, and the steps to
be taken to reproduce it, and any other information that may be useful, and
click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the screen. You need to open an
account to do this, and then you'll be emailed whenever this bug is attended
to.</p>
<p>Asking for a new feature works similar. Click on "Tasks". A list of tasks,
that is, feature requests, will appear. If the feature you wish to have it not
yet in, click "Tasks" - "Submit", and submit a new task.</p>
<p>When submitting bug reports it is sometimes useful to include the configuration and data of Bibledit-Gtk. This allows the programmer or tester to reproduce your
bug, and so fix it. In a terminal type</p>
<pre>tar -czf bibledit.tar.gz .bibledit</pre>
<p>to create a file called bibledit.tar.gz. This file can be attached to the
bug report.</p>
<h3><a name="howitstarted"/>How it started</h3>
<p>It started with an entry in the programmer's diary:</p>
<p>* Friday 30 May 2003. I made the decision to move from Windows to Linux. God
will help here, and the future will show why this decision had to be taken. A
lot of programming needs to be done to move the Bible translation programs to
Linux.</p>
<p>I remember that at that time I had lost peace with God for a good while, was
in great unrest of mind, and examined myself thoroughly to find out what it was, and then
came to the above decision. It seemed to me a bit an unusual cause for this
unrest, but nevertheless I could not find another one. After the decision was
made and the actual move, I regained my peace.</p>
<p>In 2004 some programming work was done that aided Bible translation work, and as I foresaw a greater future use for
this program, I called it Bibledit.</p>
<p>After that God gave sufficient energy to work on the project in the spare time. Others started to
contribute too, and the project moved forward to where it is now.</p>
<h3><a name="usingthedebugger"/>Using the debugger</h3>
<p>When troubleshooting bibledit a core file may be requested.</p>
<p>A core file is a file created by the operating system when a program
terminates unexpectedly, encounters a bug, or violates the operating system's
protection mechanisms.</p>
<p>By default core files are not created on some Linux systems. Whether or not
the operating system creates core files is controlled by the ulimit command. To
see the current ulimit setting for core files, do the following:</p>
<pre>ulimit -c<br/>0</pre>
<p>The ulimit command sets limits on the resource available to the bash shell.
The -c parameter controls the size of core files. The value 0 indicates that
core files are not created. To enable core file creation, increase the size
limit of core files to a number greater than zero. For example:</p>
<pre>ulimit -c 50000</pre>
<p>allows core files and limits the file size to 50000 bytes.</p>
<p>If you need to enable core file creation temporarily to create a core file
for a problem application, increase the ulimit at the command line and then run
the application.</p>
<p>When bibledit causes a segmentation fault and leaves a core dump file, you
can use gdb to look at the program state when it crashed. Use the core command
to load a core file.The argument to the core command is the filename of the
core dump file, which is usually "core.&lt;pid&gt;", making the full command
core core.&lt;pid&gt;.</p>
<pre>prompt &gt; bibledit<br/>Segmentation fault (core dumped)<br/>prompt &gt; gdb bibledit<br/>...<br/>(gdb) core core.&lt;pid&gt;<br/>...</pre>
<p>If bibledit crashes repeatedly, an easier way is to start bibledit through
the debugger, and then use the backtrace command to see what happened and
when.</p>
<p>Open bibledit in the debugger:</p>
<pre>gdb bibledit</pre>
<p>Bibledit would not run in gdb normally and say that another copy is already
running. To disable that check for another instance, and have it run in gdb,
add the --debug argument to the commandline:</p>
<pre>(gdb) set args --debug</pre>
<p>Run it:</p>
<pre>(gdb) run</pre>
<p>If there is a problem, bibledit will freeze. Switch to the debugger. View
the stack:</p>
<pre>(gdb) backtrace</pre>
<p>You can then contact the developer and inform him about what you see and
when it happened.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>On Cygwin, gdb might get stopped and return you to the terminal. Enter "fg"
to get the debugger back.</p></div></body></html><name>site/community/development.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/extra/bibletime.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/extra</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>BibleTime</h1>BibleTime is a front-end for the Sword library. <br/>Bibledit-BibleTime can retrieve the focused reference through Bibledit-Web, and then forward it to Xiphos.<br/>To make this work, do the following:<br/>Install Bibledit-Web on your local computer or on the web.Point Bibledit-Gtk to Bibledit-Web, so that it knows where to send its focused reference.

Version 1.2, November 2002
</p>
<pre>Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/></pre>
<p>
<strong>0. PREAMBLE</strong>
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</p>
<p>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
</p>
<p>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</p>
<p>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. VERBATIM COPYING</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. MODIFICATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>A.</strong> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</li><li><strong>B.</strong> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.</li><li><strong>C.</strong> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.</li><li><strong>D.</strong> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</li><li><strong>E.</strong> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.</li><li><strong>F.</strong> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</li><li><strong>G.</strong> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</li><li><strong>H.</strong> Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li><li><strong>I.</strong> Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.</li><li><strong>J.</strong> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</li><li><strong>K.</strong> For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein.</li><li><strong>L.</strong> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</li><li><strong>M.</strong> Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.</li><li><strong>N.</strong> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</li><li><strong>O.</strong> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li></ul>
<p>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements."
</p>
<p>
<strong>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
<p>
<strong>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</strong>
</p>
<p>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8. TRANSLATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9. TERMINATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
</p>
<p>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<h3><a name="howtousethislicenseforyourdocuments"/>How to use this License for your documents</h3>
<p>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<pre>Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.<br/>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br/>under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2<br/>or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br/>with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover<br/>Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU<br/>Free Documentation License".<br/></pre>
<p>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
</p>
<pre>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br/>Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br/></pre>
<p>
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of

<p style="text-align:center">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p><p>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<h3><a name="preamble"/>Preamble</h3>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<h3><a name="termsandconditions"/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
<h4><a name="0definitions"/>0. Definitions.</h4>
<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</p>
<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<h4><a name="1sourcecode"/>1. Source Code.</h4>
<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.</p>
<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</p>
<h4><a name="2basicpermissions"/>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</p>
<h4><a name="3protectinguserslegalrightsfromanticircumventionlaw"/>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</p>
<h4><a name="4conveyingverbatimcopies"/>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<h4><a name="5conveyingmodifiedsourceversions"/>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<ul><li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.</li><li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
“keep intact all notices”.</li><li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li><li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.</li></ul>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p>
<h4><a name="6conveyingnonsourceforms"/>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</p>
<ul><li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.</li><li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li><li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.</li><li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li><li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.</li></ul>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<h4><a name="7additionalterms"/>7. Additional Terms.</h4>
<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ul><li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li><li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li><li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li><li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or</li><li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li><li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.</li></ul>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<h4><a name="8termination"/>8. Termination.</h4>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p>
<h4><a name="9acceptancenotrequiredforhavingcopies"/>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<h4><a name="10automaticlicensingofdownstreamrecipients"/>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<h4><a name="11patents"/>11. Patents.</h4>
<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</p>
<p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
<h4><a name="12nosurrenderofothersfreedom"/>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<h4><a name="13usewiththegnuafferogeneralpubliclicense"/>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</p>
<h4><a name="14revisedversionsofthislicense"/>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</p>
<h4><a name="15disclaimerofwarranty"/>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<h4><a name="16limitationofliability"/>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<h4><a name="17interpretationofsections15and16"/>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<h3><a name="howtoapplythesetermstoyournewprograms"/>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br/>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>(at your option) any later version.<br/>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary.

<p>This page describes the internals of Bibledit. That is, it gives technical
specifications and information about how Bibledit works internally.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Temporary-directory"/>Temporary directory</h2><h3><a name="temporarydirectory"/></h3>
<p>The directory where Bibledit stores all temporary working data is in
directory</p>
<pre>/tmp/bibledit</pre>
<h2><a name="TOC-Stylesheets-storage"/>Stylesheets storage</h2><h3><a name="stylesheetsstorage"/></h3>
<p>The stylesheets, as templates, are xml files, stored in <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">&lt;data
directory&gt;</a>/stylesheets. Same for imported and exported
stylesheets, except that they are zipped.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-Data-storage"/>Data storage</h2><h3><a name="datastorage"/></h3>
<p>Data, that means, the USFM files, are internally stored as flat files, one
file per chapter. This gives faster access to the data. The files are stored in <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">&lt;data
directory&gt;</a>/projects/&lt;project
name&gt;, along with other files related to this project.</p>
<h3><a name="gittasks"/></h3><h2><a name="TOC-Bibledit-Windows-Outpost"/>Bibledit Windows Outpost</h2>
<p>The Outpost allows Bibledit to interact with Windows related stuff.</p>
<p>The Outpost does not have any visible functionality of its own.</p>
<p>For communication to take place, Windows Outpost needs to use the same
emulator as the other Windows programs you use on Linux. This means that if you
install BibleWorks using Wine, then Windows Outpost must also be installed on
Wine. And if you use CrossOver Office, then you need to use CrossOver Office
for both, and both need to be installed in the same bottle.</p>
<p>Bibledit connects to the interface on the Outpost, and communicates through
that channel. This TCP/IP interface listens on port 51515.</p>
<p>For diagnostics or control you can connect to it. In a terminal type</p>
<pre>telnet localhost 51515</pre>
<p>The following commands are recognized.</p>
<pre>BibleWorksReferenceGet</pre>
<p>This returns the reference that BibleWorks now displays.</p>
<pre>BibleWorksReferenceSet Mat 1:1</pre>
<p>This causes BibleWorks to scroll to Matthew 1:1.</p>
<pre>SantaFeFocusReferenceGet</pre>
<p>This returns the reference that is displayed by programs that work with the
SantaFeFocus system, such as Paratext.</p>
<pre>SantaFeFocusReferenceSet MAT 1:1</pre>
<p>This lets programs, that work with the SantaFeFocus system, display Matthew
1:1.</p>
<pre>SantaFeFocusWordSet Saviour</pre>
<p>This lets programs like Toolbox, that work with the SantaFeFocus system,
jump to the word "Saviour".</p>
<pre>Version</pre>
<p>This gives the version number.</p>
<pre>Hide</pre>
<p>This hides Bibledit Windows Outpost.</p>
<pre>Show</pre>
<p>This shows Bibledit Windows Outpost.</p>
<pre>Quit</pre>
<p>This disconnects from Bibledit Windows Outpost.</p>
<pre>Exit</pre>
<p>This exist Bibledit Windows Outpost.</p>
<pre>Open http://domain.org</pre>
<p>This opens a html or pdf file. Works on Windows only.</p>
<p>All this information is not really needed in normal cases. Bibledit takes
care of it.</p>
<p>Outpost version 1.7 and later have support for the Online Bible. See the
examples below of what can be done with it.</p>
<pre>OLB Connect</pre>
<p>Connects to the Online Bible.</p>
<pre>OLB GetVersionList</pre>
<p>This gets the list of abbreviations of Bibles that the Online Bible
provides, e.g. AV.</p>
<pre>OLB GetVersionTitleList</pre>
<p>This is like "GetVersionList", but it provides the full titles, e.g. AV -
1769 Authorized Version.</p>
<pre>OLB GetBookNamesForVersion</pre>
<p>This gets the list of names of the books that is in a certain version. The
version is to be provided, e.g.: OLB GetBookNamesForVersion AV.</p>
<pre>OLB GetBookAbbreviationsForVersion</pre>
<p>This is like GetBookNamesForVersion, but it provides the abbreviations.</p>
<pre>OLB GetChapterCountForBook</pre>
<p>This gets the number of chapters in a book. The version has to be provided,
and the book abbreviation, e.g.: OLB GetChapterCountForBook AV Ge.</p>
<pre>OLB GetVerseCountForChapter</pre>
<p>This gets the number of verses in a chapter. The version has to be provided,
then the book abbreviation, then the chapter number, e.g. "OLB
GetVerseCountForChapter AV Ge 1".</p>
<pre>OLB GetVerseText</pre>
<p>This gets the text of a verse, e.g.: OLB GetVerseText AV "Ge 1:1". Notice
the use of quotes.</p>
<pre>OLB GetSearchList</pre>
<p>This searches a version in for some text. Sample: </p>
<pre>OLB GetSearchList AV "Noah"</pre>
<p>You can add a "T" at the end to make it a phrase search, and a "F" to make
it a word search. A space should be before the T or the F.</p>
<pre>OLB ShowPassage</pre>
<p>Scrolls the Online Bible to the passage, e.g.: OLB ShowPassage AV "Ge 2:4".
Quotes are needed.</p>
<pre>OLB GetPassage</pre>
<p>This receives the focused passage from the Online Bible.</p>
<pre>OLB Disconnect</pre>
<p>Disconnects from the Online Bible.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Floating-windows"/>Floating windows</h2><h3><a name="floatingwindows"/></h3>
<p>All the windows of Bibledit are floating and can be resized. If a new window
is opened, then Bibledit will look for the largest available open space, and
place the window there. It will also size the window so that it fills that open
space. If there is no sufficient space available to place a window in, then
Bibledit will look for the largest window, make it half the size, and place the
new window in the open space so created.</p>

<p>Bibledit supports several of the markers.</p>

<p>By editing the stylesheet of a project, the number of supported markers can

<h3><a name="text"/>Text</h3>
<p>Standard Format Markers are markers that are put in the text to indicate
the book, where a chapter starts, the verse, titles and so on.</p>
<p>A marker always starts with a backslash (\) at the beginning of a line of
text in the editor. The most commonly used Standard Format markers are:</p>
<pre>\id Identifies the book</pre>
<pre>\mt major title (if only one level is used. If more than one used:)</pre>
<pre>\mt1 major title, level 1</pre>
<pre>\mt2 major title, level 2 (equal to secondary title \st, but \st is no longer in use)</pre>
<pre>\c chapter</pre>
<pre>\s section heading</pre>
<pre>\p paragraph</pre>
<pre>\v verse</pre>
<p>Here follows a part of the book of John.</p>
<pre>\id JHN</pre>
<pre>\mt2 The Gospel according to</pre>
<pre>\mt1 John</pre>
<pre>\c 1</pre>
<pre>\s The Word became flesh</pre>
<pre>\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</pre>
<p>Explanation of markers used.</p>
<pre>\id JHN</pre>
<p>Identifies the book as John</p>
<pre>\mt2 The Gospel according to</pre>
<p>A major title, level 2. When printed it will have a font just a bit
smaller than \mt</p>
<pre>\mt1 John</pre>
<p>A major title, level 1. When printed it will have a big font suitable for
such a title.</p>
<pre>\c 1</pre>
<p>Indicates that chapter one starts here.</p>
<pre>\s The Word became flesh</pre>
<p>This is a section heading, and will be printed in the text as a heading,
usually in bold.</p>
<pre>\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</pre>
<p>This is the text of verse one.</p>
<p>More information on <a href="./site/gtk/reference/usfm.html">USFM</a> is available.</p>
<h3><a name="data"/>Data</h3>
<p>All project data is stored in the <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">data
directory.</a></p>
<h3><a name="undo"/>Undo and Redo<br/></h3>
<p>As long as you stay in the same chapter, you can undo and redo any changes made.
See menu Edit, or use the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/keyboard-accelerators.html">keyboard accelerators</a>.<br/></p>
<h3><a name="insertingbiblenotes"/>Inserting Bible notes</h3>
<p>All Bible notes can be inserted by choosing the appropriate style.</p>
<p>A <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-none/insert-footnote-endnote-crossreference.html">new window</a> will come up, where you can set what will be inserted.</p>
<p>The numbering can be set to automatic, or no numbering at all, or a
certain character.</p>
<p>Further you can set whether to automatically insert the current reference
in the footnote. If you do insert it, then you can set whether to include the
chapter number, and the verse number, and what the separator between them
will be. A suffix can be entered too. It will show how this is going to look
in the text.</p>
<p>The size of the text entry or entries can be set using the "Size"
arrows.</p>
<p>It is possible to save a certain footnote configuration in a template. The
"New" button will make a new template, and the "Delete" button will delete
the current one. If no template name is given, the default one will be used.
Data is saved in a template only on pressing the "Ok" button.</p>
<p>The same things apply to endnotes and
crossreferences.</p>
<h3><a name="changingbiblenotes"/>Changing Bible notes</h3>
<p>A Bible note can be a footnote, an endnote, or a crossreference. This type
can be changed. To do that, place the cursor somewhere in the note to be
changed. Choose menu Edit / Bible note, and set the new type, and then press
OK.</p>
<p>The numbering of the note can be changed in the same way. One can for
example change from automatic to manual numbering, and vice versa.</p>
<h3><a name="pictures"/>Pictures</h3>
<p>Bibledit has good support for the \fig marker. Pictures are inserted
manually, following the USFM standard.</p>
<p>At printing time, Bibledit looks for the picture file in various ways. If
an absolute path is given, then it will look for the file there. If a
relative path is given, it first looks in &lt;<a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">data directory</a>&gt;/pictures, then among
Bibledit's template files.</p>
<p>According to the USFM standard, the picture size can be set to "col" or to
"span". In addition to that, if the picture size has not been set, Bibledit
uses the intrinsic size of the picture. The "span" property is not yet
supported at this time. All other properties are.</p>
<h3><a name="view"/>View</h3>
<p>The text is displayed in formatted form. This means that the raw USFM code
is hidden, and instead the code is formatted and is displayed in that
form.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to view or edit the raw USFM code, there is a setting
for this in menu View / USFM code. If this menu entry is ticked, the raw USFM
code can be edited. If the tick is removed it reverts to the normal formatted
view.</p>
<p>In the formatted view, the stylesheet will determine what part of the text
is formatted and what is left unformatted. If the stylesheet contains all the
styles in the document, then everything will be formatted. If a style is in
the document, but not in the stylesheet, than that particular style will be
shown unformatted, but the rest is still formatted. In this way, by using
various stylesheets with more or less styles, Bibledit can be more or less
formatted. In this way the user has a lot of flexibility to fine-tune the
view. Some styles will always be unformatted.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/3-editing.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/bibledit-for-windows-tutorial.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Bibledit for Windows Tutorial</h1><p><span style="font-family:Arial">(most of this tutorial applies to Linux but some things may be slightly different) </span></p>

<p>Bibledit contains a number of tools to check the text. Most of these are
accessible through menu Check.</p>
<p>Any undesired checking results can be hidden for the future, so that they
don't appear again if the same check is ran again. To hide such a result,
right-click in the References Area, and choose "Hide from now on".</p>
<h3><a name="characterinventory"/>Character inventory</h3>
<p>This check, accessible through the menu, Check - Characters - Inventory,
gives a list of all characters in the project, and the count of each
character.</p>
<p>Due to newline handling on Linux the character counter will only include
U+000A but not U+000D. After importing the file the U+000D completely
disappears and so will not be counted.</p>
<p>A character can occur anywhere in the output html file, depending on how
sorting is done.</p>
<p>The file will be visible in the Internet browser, which will supply its own
default font so as to ensure the character becomes visible. No particular font
is enforced.</p>
<p>The check does not handle legacy encoded data. This is because anything with
such data will be converted to Unicode when imported in Bibledit, and so the
character counting check will never encounter anything else but Unicode.</p>
<h3><a name="comparepunctuation"/>Compare punctuation</h3>
<p>Paratext had a check called "Compare Punctuation". How do I compare
punctuation in Bibledit?</p>
<p>Comparing punctuation in Bibledit is done through the Advanced Find
functions.</p>
<p>Open the first project, and search for e.g. a question mark. The search
results will be loaded in the References Area.</p>
<p>Open the second project, and go to advanced search, and search for the
question mark again. Remove the search results from the ones already in the
References Area. The References Area will now contain the verses that do have
the question mark in the first project, and not in the second.</p>
<p>Next do it the other way round. Search in the second project, then with
advanced search in the first. The References Area will now contain the verses
that do have the question mark in the second project, but not in the first.</p>
<h3><a name="checkmatchingpairs"/>Check matching pairs</h3>
<p>Checks whether punctuation that is part of a pair makes a complete pair. For
example, the opening bracket [ also needs the closing bracket ].</p>
<p>The check knows about 160 matching pairs of punctuation, and checks them
all.</p>
<p>Pairs that should not be checked can be ignored. No reports will be given on
these characters.</p>
<h3><a name="checkunwantedpatterns"/>Check unwanted patterns</h3>
<p>This check looks for patterns that are unwanted. For example, when the
pattern " ?", that is a question mark preceded by a space, is unwanted, enter
this in the dialog box of the check, and from now on this unwanted pattern will
be reported.</p>
<h3><a name="checkunwantedwords"/>Check unwanted words</h3>
<p>This looks for unwanted whole words in the text, and reports them when they
have been found.</p>
<p>In the dialog, you can enter a list of whole words to be looked for, one
word per line.</p>
<h3><a name="repeatingwords"/>Repeating words</h3>
<p>This check aims to find repeating words, as sometimes, but not always,
repeating words are a mistake. For example if the text has "Jesus said said:
Whoever follows me ...", then the "said said" is a repeating word entered by
mistake. This check will find these.</p>
<p>This check will also find repeating words that are not a mistake. For
example consider this USFM text:</p>
<pre>\x - \xo 1.6: \xt Matt. 10.2; 3 John 1:1.\x*</pre>
<p>This check will say that the word "1" repeats. It does so because the
crossreference "3 John 1:1" has a repeating "1". Both chapter and verse are 1.
To prevent these false hits enter an "Ignore" word of ":". If this colon is
entered in the list, it no longer will find the "1" repeating.</p>
<p>Some languages have words with reduplicated roots which could be separated
with hyphens, e.g., manuk-manuk. The check will mark "manuk" as repeating. If
the hyphen (-) is entered under the "Ignore" button, then this words will no
longer be marked as repeating.</p>
<h3><a name="notes"/>Notes</h3>
<p>Some of the checks produce references in the reference area. The references
so produced can be used to quickly go to the relevant places in the Bible. And
the references can also be printed.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/checking.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Collaboration</h1><h3><a name="TOC-Setup"/>Setup</h3>
<p>It is recommended to read the <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/1intro.html">brief introduction</a> to the system.</p>
<p>The central part to collaboration is the repository. The system administrator will have <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup.html">set the
repository up</a>, will have <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/3reposinit.html">initialized it</a>, and
issued its URL. If the repository is a secure one, <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup/secure-shell-keys-setup.html">set up the secure shell keys</a> to
access it.</p>
<p>The repository is now ready for use. It remains to add users who make use of
this repository and share their data through it.</p>
<p>In this tutorial it will be user Jim. In Bibledit, Jim opens the project he
wishes to share with others, or he creates a new project. He goes to menu <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/dialog-remote-repository.html">Preferences / Remote repository</a>. and sets everything
up. Jim can now work on Bibledit as before, and his data will be automatically
updated in the repository.</p>
<h3><a name="collaborating"/>Collaborating</h3>
<p>Now we come to the purpose of everything, which is working together on one
project.</p>
<p>This collaboration is very simple: Just work on your data as you did
before. At times when you´d like to share your work with others, or when you'd like to see work done by others, choose menu File / Project / Send-Receive. Bibledit cares for everything, and everything will be updated and shared
automatically.</p>
<h3><a name="safety"/>Safety</h3>
<p>Suppose that two or more people collaborate on one project. One of them is a
bad typist. He makes many errors. The bad typist has the potential the harm or
destroy the project's data. If he makes serious mistakes in his own data, then
the collaboration mechanism will propage his mistakes to the other members of
the team. This is not a desirable situation.</p>
<p>Bibledit has a solution for this situation. You can use two mechanisms of
Bibledit simultaneously.</p>
<p>1. Collaboration through the network or the USB stick.</p>
<p>2. <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/merge-tutorial.html">Merging changes</a>. </p>
<p>This is how to do it:</p>
<p>1. The experienced person has project "master" that has the master copy of
the Bible. Collaboration of the master project is switched off so that no
changes can enter that project by mistake.</p>
<p>2. The experienced person has project "messy" that initially is a copy of
the master project. Collaboration is switched on.</p>
<p>3. The unexperienced typist has project "messy" too, with collaboration
switched on.</p>
<p>4. The unexperienced typist makes changes in project "messy", and through
collaboration these changes go into project "messy" of the experienced typist
too. This all goes automatic.</p>
<p>5. Once in a while the experienced person goes to the Merge tool. He opens
project "master" and project "messy", reviews the changes as proposed in
project "messy", makes any edits he likes, takes out any mistakes he does not
like, and then finally merges the changes from "messy" into "master". This is
done chapter by chapter. Once the merge is done, project "master" and "messy"
are identical again in that particular chapter.</p>
<p>6. Any changes entered or not entered propagate to the unexperienced typist
again through the collaboration. If the unexperienced typist made a big mess in
a certain chapter, through the collaboration this mess is cleared up again on
his computer.</p>
<h3><a name="notes"/>Notes</h3>
<p>- The collaboration system can conveniently be used for automatic backup.
</p>
<p>- Collaboration of two projects on the same computer is possible if those
projects have the same ancestor, that is, one is created by importing all the
Biblebooks exported of the other one. This can be helpful for demo purposes and
to test and learn to use this tool if only one computer is available.</p>
<p>- Sending and receiving the data of your Bible will happen automatically at
intervals. Bibledit will receive any changes from the repository, and then send
its own changes to that repository. To manually send and receive your Bible,
use menu File / Send / receive.</p>
<p>- Using collaboration with merging data has advantages in the following
situation: Think of the situation that a bad typist is out in the bush, and
comes to town with his stick, and has little time for the master person to
merge while he waits. So just plugging in he stick, a quick automatic merge,
and away he goes again. Then if the master person has some time in the days or
weeks following, he can then carefully go through the messy project, and merge
it with the master project, taking his time for it, and doing an accurate
job.</p><p>- There is not much need to maintain the git repository since Bibledit does run maintenance on it at regular times. But if you really like to compress the repository well, you can run "git gc --aggressive" in the repository. Note that Bibledit already runs "git gc" at regular times.</p><p>- If two or more users were to work on the same chapter at the same time, this would pose a problem for Bibledit. This type of collaboration is not supported. People should work on different chapters, or on the same chapters, but not simultaneously. Then the merging of the changes will work well.<br/></p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/keyterms-tutorial.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Keyterms</h1><p>To start checking terms in Bibledit, in the Checking menu choose Key
terms.</p>

<p>A new window will open. This is the "Check keyterms" window.</p>

<p>At the top of the window you can choose which collection of words to
check.</p>

<p>The window will also display a list of keyterms in that collection.</p>

<p>Let's check the translation you made for the word "lamb" in the New
Testament.</p>

<p>Choose the Flora and Fauna of the New Testament.</p>

<p>In the list of keyterms, locate the first "lamb". Click on the link to
activate this keyterm.</p>

<p>Extra information about "lamb" will be displayed.</p>

<p>Any references that have the word "lamb", or should have it, will be
displayed as well.</p>

<p>If you'd like to more closely examine or change a passage that has the word
"lamb", you can click on the blue reference. For example, when you would click
on John 1:36, the editor would then go to that references, and you can change
if needed.</p>

<p>Still further down a list of correct renderings for "lamb" becomes visible.
Initially this list is empty.</p>

<p>To add a rendering, click once on &lt;Enter a new rendering here&gt;, and
then press Enter. Type the word, e.g. "wundlu", and press Enter. You'll find
that, if this rendering, the word "wundlu", is found in the texts, it shows it
as bold.</p>

<p>A faster way of adding renderings is to select text and then press Ctrl-C as
if copying that text to the clipboard. The rendering will be added as a whole
word, and if there was any capital in the word, the case sensitive option will
be set too.</p>

<p>In the renderings you can set whether a rendering is supposed to be a whole
word, and whether the word is case sensitive.</p>

<p>To remove a rendering from the list, click once on the word to be removed,
then press Enter, remove the word, and press Enter again.</p>

<h3><a name="notes"/>Notes</h3>

<p>- The keywords are divided into collections. If you select a particular
collection, then the keyterms in the other collections are not displayed.</p>

<p>- The renderings are stored with the project.</p>

<p>- If the user clicks a verse, the editor will also display that verse.</p>

<p>- It is possible to have the keyterms in the active verse show up while you
are translating. The renderings, if any have been entered, will show up too.
This will help the translator, so that he can choose the same rendering if the
same keyterms occurs in that verse. To show the keyterms, choose menu View /
Keyterms in verse.</p>

<p>- New keyterms can be <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data/import.html">imported</a>,
existing keyterms can be <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data/export.html">exported</a>, and
collections of them can be <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/menu-keyterms.html">deleted</a>.</p>

<p>- Some references have the keyterms only implied by their context. That
means that the key terms does not occur in the verse literally, but only by
implications. To mark such verses correct, select a reasonable part of the
verse and add it to the renderings. Then, the verse will be marked correct. Or
just leave it as marked incorrect.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/keyterms-tutorial.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/merge-tutorial.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Merging</h1><h3><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction</h3>
<p>At times there may be a need to branch off a translation project, so that
two translation projects exists, the main one and the branch. Various people
then can work on the branch. After some changes have been made, there may be a
need to merge the branched project back into the main project.</p>
<p>Some teams have a main project and an edited project. The main project is
maintained by one person. All the members of the team work on the edited
project. At times the person that maintains the main project would wish to
merge the data of the edited project into the main one.</p>
<p>Bibledit provides the "Merge" tool for the above scenarios and for any other
scenario the user can use it for.</p>
<h3><a name="setup"/>Setup</h3>
<p>In order for data of two projects to be merged succesfully, both of the
projects need to have what is called a common ancestor. That means that going
back in the history of the projects, there must be a moment in time that the
data of the projects was the same. Usually this is accomplished by:</p>
<p>1. Making a copy of the main project. The main project remains as it is, and
the copy of that project becomes the "edited" project.</p>
<p>2. Exporting a file of one project and importing it into the other one. </p>
<p>So, the setup is simple. Just take one project, or export from one project
and import it into the other one. The data of these two projects is now capable
to be merged after some changes have been made in the text.</p>
<h3><a name="operation"/>Operation</h3>
<p>So, how does the merge work?</p>
<p>The first step is to open two projects in the same window, so that both of
these projects are visible at the same time.</p>
<p>Then open the merge window.</p>
<p>In the merge window, it asks for the master project, and the edited project.
If both of these are selected, then the text of the projects will show up in
the window.</p>
<p>Any changes are visible in that window. Additions are marked in bold and
deletions in strike-through. It is important to know at this stage that any
footnotes, endnotes and crossreferences are not marked this way.</p>
<p>If the editor goes to another chapter, the changes will be reloaded.</p>
<p>There are also two buttons in the merge window, one labelled "Previous", and
one "Next". These buttons, if clicked, will look for the next or previous
chapter that has changes.</p>
<p>Then there is the "Merge" button. Clicking this button starts the merge
procedure.</p>
<p>It shows various possible actions to take. These are described below.</p>
<h4><a name="mergechapterofeditedprojectandmasterproject"/>Merge chapter of edited project and master project</h4>
<p>Once the merge operation starts it looks through the history of both
projects to find the common ancestor for this chapter. It then tries the merge
operation. If all went fine, then that's it: The job has been done. </p>
<p>Here follows a bit of a description of the merge process. It is not so that
the last change that was made in any of the projects will be taken. It works
slightly different. There is the master project, and the edited project. If the
user merges these both, then the tool is going to look back in the history of
all changes ever made in that chapter, till it finds the point that this
particular chapter is the same in both master and edited project. It then looks
at the changes made in the master project, and tries to keep these. It also
looks at the changes made in the edited project, and tries to keep these too.
It then puts both of these changes in a new chapter, and finally saves that
chapter in both master and edited project, so that we can truly say that a
merge has occurred. The goal is that this chapter is going to be merged, and
will after merge be the same in both projects.</p>
<p>If all did not go well, then that means that there were changes in both of
the projects that would affect one and the same place. Bibledit does not know
in such a case which of the two changes is the correct one, and needs the user
to select the correct text. A window will then open showing one or more pairs
of buttons. Each button has a label showing the possible text. Clicking on the
one button inserts the one text, and clicking the other button inserts the
other text. If you click a button, it means that you approve of the text that
is in its label. When all places have been corrected, then the OK button at the
bottom of the window becomes active. Clicking that saves the text, and ends the
merge operation.</p>
<h4><a name="mergechapterofeditedprojectandmasterprojectandapproveofeachchangeascomparedtomasterproject"/>Merge chapter of edited project and master project, and approve of each change as compared to master project</h4>
<p>This is an addition to the simple merge procedure as descibed above. The
extra thing here is that changes are not automatically accepted. Each change
must be approved of manually. A window becomes visible that allows to approve
of change. If a button has a "+", then it means there is an addition to the
master project. And if it has a "-", then that means that something was deleted
from the master project. Approval of a change is made by just clicking the
button. Once one or more changes have been approved, if the user clicks the
"Save" button, then the changes will be saved in the master project. Change
won't be saved to the edited project. If that is desired, as it usually is,
then the merge operation should be repeated, with the option chosen to copy the
chapter from the master project to the edited project.</p>
<h4><a name="copychapterofmasterprojecttoeditedproject"/>Copy chapter of master project to edited project</h4>
<p>This copies a chapter from the master project to the edited project. The
chapter to be copied is the one that is visible in the editor.</p>
<h4><a name="copyeverythingofmasterprojecttoeditedproject"/>Copy everything of master project to edited project</h4>
<p>This copies everything from the master project to the edited project. Useful
for ensuring that the edited project is the same as the master.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/merge-tutorial.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/navigation.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Navigation</h1><h3><a name="TOC-Internal"/>Internal</h3>

<p>There are <a href="./site/gtk/reference/keyboard-accelerators.html">keyboard accelerators</a> for moving
to the next or previous verse, chapter or book. There is also a toolbar with
controls for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If going to a next verse, but Bibledit is already at the last verse of a
chapter, it will then go to the first verse of the next chapter. Same for the
next chapter, if Bibledit is at the last one of a book, it will go to the first
one of the next book.</p>

<p>Left on the toolbar there are two arrows. The left arrow takes you to the
place in the Bible that you have recently viewed. The right arrow will take you
back to where you came from. You can click an arrow several times, if you have
viewed enough places.</p>

<p>There is also a keyboard accelerator for going to any Bible reference. This
is Ctrl-G. The "G" stands for "Go to". It accepts many different forms of a
Bible reference. If the editor displays Matthew 1:10, for example, and the user
enters "11", it will go to the next verse. If "2:3" is entered, or "2 3", then
the editor will go to Matthew 2:3. If "Gen 1:10" is entered, it will go to
Genesis 1:10. And so forth.</p>

<p>Bibledit can remember the most recent verse per chapter, and the most recent
chapter per book. This is supposed to assist with the navigation through the
Bible and make it faster. It should be enabled <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/user-interface.html">in the User interface options</a>.</p>

<p>To move the keyboard focus to a text editor press F5.</p>

<p>Shift+F5 takes you to one of the tools windows. Pressing it repeatedly
focuses all open tool windows in sequence.</p>

<p>Ctrl+F5 goes to the project notes window<a href="javascript:void(0);">.</a></p>

<p>Repeatedly pressing the Tab key moves between all windows counter-clockwise,
and Shift+Tab moves the focus between the windows clockwise.</p>

<p>Moving with the Up/Down arrow key to a certain verse and then use Alt-Left
arrow key jumps back to the verse you started to move from. If you use the
Up/Down arrow key several time you can use the Alt-Left arrow key also several
times. The Alt-Right arrow key works too. It goes in the history to the next in
a whole series of moves.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/navigation.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/notes.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Notes</h1><p>Bibledit supports a variety of notes that can be made during

<p>Bibledit can assist you in planning the work.</p>
<p>There are three places in the Bibledit menu that are relevant to
planning.</p>
<p>1. Preferences / Planning. This is for setting it up.</p>
<p>2. Edit / Planning. This is for editing the planning and status.</p>
<p>3. View / Planning. This shows the planning and reports on progress made.</p>
<p>How it works is going to be explained below by an example.</p>
<h3><a name="settingup"/>Setting up</h3>
<p>Go to menu Preferences / Planning. The Planning Setup dialog shows.</p>
<p>The first thing to do in that dialog is to indicate when the project was
started.</p>
<p>After that you can enter the tasks that the project consists of. Let's add
two tasks, "First draft", and "Final draft".</p>
<p>The last thing to do is to indicate how much time each task takes to
complete one chapter. Let's enter three days per chapter for the first draft,
and two days per chapter for the final draft.</p>
<p>This sets you up for making a planning and for reporting the progress.</p>
<h3><a name="updatingprogress"/>Updating progress</h3>
<p>Once you have set up everything, the next thing to do is to update the
progress of the work. This can be done through menu Edit / Planning. If this is
chosen, a dialog, called "Planning Edit" shows.</p>
<p>You can <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/edit/status.html">edit the project's status</a>. This
means that you can tick off which bits of work have been completed.</p>
<p>For making a planning for the shorter term, you can enter which task are
supposed to be done.</p>
<h3><a name="statusreport"/>Status report</h3>
<p>In order to view the status report, choose View / Planning. This should give
a report of the progress you make, and the planning.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/planning.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/printing.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Printing</h1><h2><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction</h2>
<p>Bibledit can print things like a list of references along with the text,
or the whole project, or part of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>Printing is done this way: Bibledit generates a .pdf file, and then opens
this file in a pdf viewer. From there it can be printed.</p>
<h2><a name="font"/>Font</h2>
<p>The font to be used can be set under menu View / Font &amp; Colour /
Text.</p>
<p>Additional fonts could be looked for by searching the internet for "Free
Unicode fonts" or at <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/" rel="nofollow">http://scripts.sil.org</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="lineheight"/>Line height</h2>
<p>In the dialog where the font can be selected, there is also a setting for
the line height, in percentages. Normally it is on 100%. Setting it to e.g.
200% gives the line a double height. This would for example allow for text
and notes to be written between the lines on worksheets.</p>
<h2><a name="biblenotes"/>Bible notes</h2>
<p>These are <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/notes/bible-notes.html">footnotes, endnotes, and
crossreferences.</a></p>
<h2><a name="locationofpdffiles"/>Location of .pdf files</h2>
<p>The .pdf file for printing a project usually is <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">temporary
directory</a>/document.pdf.</p>
<h2><a name="columns"/>Columns</h2>
<p>Normally text is laid out in two columns. The stylesheet editor allows the
"span columns" property to be set. This means that a certain piece of content
spans the two columns. Biblical content honours this setting, but content
from the Front Matter and the Back Matter is laid out in one column.</p>
<h2><a name="newpages"/>New pages</h2>
<p>Normally Bibledit prints all the books one after the other, without
starting them on a new page. This behaviour is implemented so that normally
not too much paper is used. Bibledit can be set to print each new book on a
new page, or, going one step further, to have each book start on an odd page.
Settings for this are in the stylesheet, under the \id marker.</p>
<h2><a name="notprintingstyles"/>Not printing styles</h2>
<p>Some styles have the "print" property in the stylesheet editor. If "print"
is unticked, then this style won't be printed. This comes in useful when
there is some data in the text that you don't want to print this time.
Footnotes, for example. The quickest way of doing this is to make two
stylesheets. One full stylesheet that prints everything. And one adapted
stylesheet that doesn't print footnotes. Just opening another stylesheet in
the editor, and printing, makes it work.</p>
<h2><a name="hyphenation"/>Hyphenation</h2>
<p>Normally words are not hyphenated. But if a word does not look well on the
printout, and hyphenation is needed, the user can insert a soft hyphen in
that word. The "Insert" menu caters for that.</p>
<h2><a name="layoutengine"/>Layout engines</h2>
<p>Bibledit uses an internal engine to lay the text out on the pages. Under
normal circumstances the commands that are sent to that engine during
printing remain invisible. But there is a setting to make these commands
visible, to review or edit them. The setting is under menu Preferences /
Printing, tab "Formatter".</p><p>Bibledit can also make use of the  <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/svn-view/sfscripture/TRUNK/ptx2pdf/" rel="nofollow">ptx2pdf</a> macros together with the XeTeX typesetter. <a href="http://confluence.ubs-icap.org/display/TTT/Home" rel="nofollow">More information is
provided by UBS</a>. If you have printed something through the ptx2pdf macros, then the files that control this printout are available in /tmp/bibledit/xetex. If you run "xetex document.tex" within that directory, you can do the typesetting again. You can modify the control files there, so as to fine-tune it to what you need. To do complex non-Roman scripts like e.g., Farsi is, you will need the latest version of XeTeX. The one that gets install with the current version of Ubuntu (9.10) may not be good enough. You can pull the most up to date version from the SIL repo. (deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu karmic main). With XeTeX you can also print numerals in a different script. See the <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/questions.html">Questions</a> for more information.<br/></p>

<h3><a name="deletingbooksfromtheproject"/>Deleting books from the project</h3>
<p>In menu File - Project - Properties, books can be removed.</p>
<h3><a name="openingaproject"/>Opening a project</h3>
<p>In the editor, just press Ctrl+O, or do it through menu File - Project -

<h3><a name="howtocompareaproject"/>How to compare a project?</h3>
<p>A whole project can be compared to another one. Any differences are
highlighted.</p>
<p>Words that have been added are printed in bold. Words removed will appear
stroked out.</p>
<p>If only the changes are printed, then the references, that have a change,
will be loaded in the Reference Area for easy review.</p>
<h3><a name="howtoprintparallelversions"/>How to print parallel versions?</h3>
<p>See the File menu, then menu Print, then Parallel Bible.</p>
<p>The so called "Parallel Bible" contains parallel versions for only one
book, and is intended for producing worksheets for use during translations
sessions. The members of the team each get a pile of sheets with all relevant
versions printed in parallel on it, verse by verse. Without these sheets each
member might have a lot of Bibles strewn about him on the desk, but with
these sheets things get more compact. And there will still be Bibles enough
on the desk, as many Bibles are not available in electronic format, and hence
cannot be printed on the worksheets.</p>
<p>Commentaries can also be printed on the worksheets, provided they are
available as projects in Bibledit.</p>
<p>The Parallel Bible will be printed with the currently opened project at
the top, and it will print the book that is currently opened. Therefore, to
change the first project on the sheets, just open another project, and for
changing the book to be printed, just go to another book.</p>
<p>To add another project to your Parallel Bible, press the "Add project"
button and select the project to be printed. Added projects can be removed
with the Remove button.</p>
<p>Normally all parallel verses are kept together on one page for greater
readability. Depending on the number of Bibles printed in parallel, this may
leave a lot of whitespace at the bottom of the page. To save paper you can
uncheck the option in the dialog, so that the parallel verses no longer are
kept together and the paper is filled with text to the bottom.</p>
<p>You can set which portion of the text to print. There are two controls
that influence this.</p>
<p>The "Change" button for the portion. This selects which portion to
print.</p>
<p>The "Include verses 0" checkbox, whether to include the verses 0 from any
of the chapters. Verse 0 is anything before verse 1.</p>
<p>At the end press button Ok to get the Bible in .pdf format.</p>

<h4><a name="howtoruntwoversionsofbibleditsimultanously"/>How to run two versions of Bibledit simultaneously?</h4>
<p>As there are some drastic changes between versions, it would be helpful to
have two different versions running of Bibledit.</p>
<p>This is possible, but not recommended for production work, as they will be
overwriting each other's configuration.</p>
<p>Do it this way.</p>
<p>Install the newer version according to the instructions.</p>
<p>When installing the older version, do this:</p>
<pre>./configure --prefix=/home/joe/older<br/>make<br/>sudo make install</pre>
<p>Then to run the older version, type this:</p>
<pre>/home/joe/older/bin/bibledit</pre>
<p>Joe stands for the user's name.</p>
<h4><a name="howtochangetheorderofthebooks"/>How to change the order of the books?</h4>
<p>You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and prints the
books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books. Drag the books in the
order you desire, and then click OK to save the settings.</p>
<h4><a name="howtomodifytheplacewherebibleditstoresitsdata"/>How to modify the place where Bibledit stores its data?</h4>

<p>Normally Bibledit stores its data in subdirectory ".bibledit" of the user's
home directory, e.g. in </p>
<pre>/home/joe/.bibledit</pre>
<p>If it is desirable to have Bibledit store its data elsewhere, the solution
is simple:</p>
<p>1. Move the current .bibledit directory to the new directory.</p>
<p>2. Create a symbolic link from .bibledit to that new directory.</p>
<p>There is a different way of pointing Bibledit to another data directory.</p>
<p>Changing is not done from within bibledit, but involves some manual work.
This is done for the protection of your valuable data. To change the data
directory to a new location, do the following:</p>
<p>Quit bibledit.</p>
<p>Open a terminal.</p>
<p>Type command</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<p>to go to your home directory. Let's say you prefer to store the data on
/mnt/server/.bibledit</p>
<p>Type command</p>
<pre>mv .bibledit /mnt/server/.bibledit</pre>
<p>to preserve and move existing data. (When there is no existing data, this
step is not needed.)</p>
<p>Type command</p>
<pre>touch .bibledit-datafolder-pointer</pre>
<p>to make a new file in the home directory, that will point to the new data
directory.</p>
<p>Open this hidden file in a text editor and put only this one line in it:</p>
<pre>/mnt/server/.bibledit</pre>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Removing file .bibledit-datafolder-pointer will cause bibledit to use the
standard datafolder again.</p>
<p>See also information about the <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">data</a>.</p>
<p>Note: It is not recommended to store the data on a Windows partition. In
such cases problems have been observed when special characters are used in the
project name.</p>
<h4><a name="howtochangetheorderofthebooks1"/>How to change the order of the books?</h4>
<p>You can fully configure in which order Bibledit displays and prints the
books. This can be done in menu, Preferences, Books. Drag the books in the
order you desire, and then click OK to save the settings.</p>
<h4><a name="howtomoveaboutinbibleditusingthekeyboard"/>How to move about in Bibledit using the keyboard?</h4>
<p>Bibledit has several windows to work in.</p>
<p>There are keyboard <a href="./site/gtk/reference/keyboard-accelerators.html">accelerators</a> for moving
between the windows.</p>
<p>What works fine, is the</p><h2><a name="TOC-How-to-print-a-table-of-contents-"/>How to print a table of contents?</h2>
<p>In the example below we're going to learn how to write a table of contents
for a project consisting of several books.</p>
<p>The table of contents comes in the book called Front Matter. Therefore, add
this book to the project.</p>
<p>Each book that should go into the table of contents should have a USFM
indicating this. Therefore, go to chapter 0 of each book and add the \toc2
marker to it. For example, in the book of Genesis, chapter 0 might look like</p>
<pre>\id GEN<br/>\h Genesis<br/>\toc2 Genesis</pre>
<p>Do this for all the books.</p>
<p>Then print the project, and be sure to include all the books, including
Front Matter. The table of contents will be there.</p>
<h4><a name="howtocreateacustomversificationsystemorlanguage"/>How to create a custom versification system or language?</h4>
<p>If the versification system or language you need does not come with
Bibledit, then you can create your own language or versification system and add
it to Bibledit yourself. To do that, take an existing versification textfile or
language textfile from /usr/share/bibledit-gtk, edit it, and save it in the <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">data directory</a>, subdirectory templates.</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>The versification files start with versification_, the mapping files with
mapping_, and the language files with language_. It is important to keep that
first bit, else Bibledit won't recognize the files.</p>
<p>If the name of a template you added is the same as the name one of the
templates that come with Bibledit, your template will be taken.</p>
<p>It would be greatly appreciated if you were willing to share the files you
have created with others. In that way others will benefit from the work that
you have already done. A good way of sharing it with the community is to submit
it for inclusion into Bibledit. That way it becomes available to others in the
next release.</p>
<h4><a name="howcanicountthenumberofcrossreferencesintheproject"/>How can I count the number of crossreferences in the project?</h4>
<p>This can be done through menu Tools, then Bible notes mass update. Tick
"Crossreferences", and leave the action to take as "Make no changes but give
statistics only". After clicking OK it will give the number of crossreferences
in the project.<br/></p><h3><a name="TOC-Installation"/>Installation</h3>

<p>Reply: When installing it on Windows, install Cygwin first. See <a href="./site/gtk/installation/windows.html">Bibledit's Windows installation

<h4><a name="thereisnoacceptableccompilerinpath"/>There is no acceptable C compiler in $path</h4>
<p>This happens when you did not install a C compiler.Installing Bibledit from
source requires a C compiler. This compiler is part of development tools. The
installation instructions for Linux, or for Macintosh, or Windows, give
instructions on how to install such development tools. If you follow these
instructions, the problem will be gone. For example, on Windows, you need to
install package "gcc" in Cygwin.</p>
<h2><a name="doeswinerunaprogramthatisalreadyonmywindowspartition"/>Problem when Outpost runs on another host
</h2><p>Q. When setting up the Outpost to run on another host, in the settings
dialog, when I type in the name of the host, I get this error message: Host
&lt;name&gt; cannot be contacted through the network.</p>
<p>A. Points to check:</p>
<p>1. Is the hostname you are entering the one set in Windows on the other
host?</p>
<p>2. Try finding out Windows' IP address, and then pinging it from Linux. If
that works, enter that IP number in the Outpost Setup dialog.</p>
<p>3. If the IP number changes continually, enter a static IP number in
Windows.</p>
<p>4. Is the Outpost installed and running in Windows? It has to be started
manually, because Bibledit can't start it over the network.</p>
<p>5. Be sure that the Windows firewall does not block port 51515 for incoming
connections.</p>
<p>6. Be sure that you have typed the right IP number. It can be checked by
opening a Command Prompt in Windows, and typing "ipconfig". The IP number
assigned to the network should correspond with the one you entered.</p>

<p>If it gives a segmentation fault, then there is a problem in your
configuration. A simple way to get Bibledit running again is to delete the file
./bibledit/settings and ./bibledit/configuration/configuration.xml. You will
loose all your settings, but not your data, and Bibledit should start again
after that.</p>
<p>If you wish to have this problem solved, before deleting your configuration
files, make a bug report, pack all your data in a gzipped tarball, and attach
this file to the <a href="./site/community/development.html">bug report</a>.</p>
<p>To go to the home directory, type</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<p>To pack everything in a tarball, type</p>
<pre>tar -cvf bibledit.tar .bibledit</pre>
<p>Then compress the tarball:</p>
<pre>gzip bibledit.tar</pre>
<p>The resulting file is named bibledit.tar.gz and can be attached to the bug
report.</p>
<p>If the problem is not a segmentation fault, but it shows nothing at all,
then the bibledit.log file might give a clue. It is in the <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">temporary directory</a>. View the
logfile to see what went wrong.</p>
<p>If you try to start bibledit, and a warning comes up that says that Bibledit
is already running, then it means that Bibledit already runs somehow. Try
switching to that instance of Bibledit that already runs. Or reboot. Or else
open a terminal and type "killalll bibledit-bin".</p>
<h4><a name="bibleditisfrozenhowtosolvethat"/>Bibledit is frozen. How to solve that?</h4>
<p>Question: I am completely stopped in my work. I opened a project, but the
book of Philemon freezes Bibledit completely. When restarting it, the screen
comes up, but none of the menus or buttons work. I cannot scroll. The only
button that works is the one to exit the program (which brings up a box giving
me the option to force-quit).</p>
<p>Answer: You can change the project from the commandline. In a terminal, type
this:</p>
<pre>bibledit --general-configuration --write --key project --value testproject</pre>
<p>Next time you start Bibledit, it will open project "testproject" - any name
will do here.</p>
<p>To change the whole configuration to default values type:</p>
<pre>bibledit --general-configuration --reset</pre>
<h4><a name="theonlinehelpdoesnotdisplay"/>The online help does not display</h4>
<p>Bibledit's online help depends on Bibledit's internal webserver. The
helpfiles only work while Bibledit is running. If you quit Bibledit, online
help is not available.</p>
<h4><a name="fieldworkslanguageexplorerinterfereswithcygwinx"/>FieldWorks Language Explorer interferes with Cygwin/X</h4>
<p>When Bibledit is running on Windows, FLEx won't start. While FLEx runs,
Bibledit will only start after a long delay due to a timeout. It won't have
clipboard functionality. The problem is being looked into. The current
workaround is to start FLEx first, and after that Bibledit. Alternatively you
can start Cygwin's terminal through the Cygwin icon in the Bibledit menu, and
in that terminal type "startx", and then "bibledit".</p>
<h3><a name="project"/>Project</h3>
<h4><a name="whenimportingdatainlegacyencodingcanbibledituseateckitmap"/>When importing data in legacy encoding, can Bibledit use a TECkit map?</h4>
<p>Bibledit uses iconv, the standard utility on Linux to convert between
various encodings.</p>
<p>Iconv supports a huge amount of standard encodings. Iconv does the same
functions as TECkit does.</p>
<p>Bibledit does not at present support a TECkit map, but that is going to
change in the future.</p>
<p>At conversion time the user sees how the text is going to look, and can
change encodings until the result looks right. If there are a couple of
characters not right, the search/replace functionality quickly fixes that.</p>
<h3><a name="printing"/>Printing</h3>
<h4><a name="bibleditproducespdfoutputbuthowdoigethtmlfiles"/>Bibledit produces .pdf output, but how do I get .html files?</h4>
<p>There are a couple of converters on the market, that convert .pdf files to
.html. Use a search engine and look for "PDF to HTML", including the quotation
marks. This will give you a number of programs to try out.</p>
<h4><a name="bolddoesnotshowupinaprintout"/>Bold does not show up in a printout</h4>
<p>Question</p>
<p>Printing a Bibledit project to pdf format, using ArialUnicode and SIL Doulos
for it, I had the following problem:</p>
<p>* Feature Bold does not show up,</p>
<p>* Feature Italics shows up.</p>
<p>Trying the same with Open Office Writer and those two fonts, I found out,
that both do not show up neither in bold nor in italics.</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>SIL Doulos does not have bold.</p>
<p>Try Charis SIL, that does have bold, and works fine with me.</p>
<h4><a name="thefootnotecallerisdetachedfromtheworditbelongsto"/>The footnote caller is detached from the word it belongs to</h4>
<p>If the USFM code is properly written, the footnote or crossreference caller
is always connected to the word it belongs to.</p>
<p>This is an example of proper code:</p>
<pre>Joseph was a good man\f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*</pre>
<p>The following two examples of code will cause the footnote caller to detach
from the word it belongs to:</p>
<p>Example one:</p>
<pre>Joseph was a good man \f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*</pre>
<p>Note the space between "man" and the "\f".</p>
<p>Example two:</p>
<pre>Joseph was a good man<br/>\f + \ft Or “kind man”.\f*</pre>
<p>In USFM a new line is equal to a space, hence there is a space between "man"
and the "\f" here also.</p>
<p>Many older projects started a new line for each marker, also for the
footnotes. This needs correction in the current system. All note markers
(footnotes and cross-references) should not start on a new line, but follow
immediately the word it belongs to (without even a space).</p>
<p>Note that in newer versions of Bibledit the \f ... code for footnotes is no
longer visible - only the note itself is visible.</p>
<h4><a name="thefootnotecallertouchesthenextword"/>The footnote caller touches the next word</h4>
<p>If the caller at the bottom of the page touches the footnote text, then you
can increase the left margin of the footnote text. In the stylesheet editor,
edit the left margin of the Text, marker \ft, and if necessary also for the
Paragraph Mark, marker \fp.</p>
<p>Same applies to the Crossreferences. Make the setting under marker \xt.</p>
<h4><a name="adobereaderdoesnotloadaprinteddocument"/>Adobe Reader does not load a printed document</h4>
<p>This may occur in case Adobe Reader has a document loaded already. A
subsequent document, printed by Bibledit, may not load in the Reader. Newer
versions of the Reader do not have this problem.</p>
<h3><a name="navigation"/>Navigation</h3>
<h4><a name="bartdoesnotscrollwithbibledit"/>BART does not scroll with Bibledit</h4>
<p>There can be various causes for this.</p>
<p>Cause 1. Has Bibledit Windows Outpost been installed?</p>
<p>Cause 2: Does it say "Windows Outpost: Connected" in the logfile?</p>
<p>Cause 3. When BART runs under Wine, did you install Bibledit Windows Outpost
in Wine too? Or when you installed BART in CrossOver Office, e.g. bottle
"win98", did you install the Outpost in the same bottle too? The wine
installation constitutes a separate Windows machine, and each bottle in
CrossOver Office also constitute each their own Windows machines. The system
BART uses for scrolling requires that it be accessed from the same Windows
machine. This means that if you installed BART in a certain bottle in CrossOver
Office, e.g. bottle "win98", then for scrolling to work, the Outpost needs to
be installed in that same bottle too.</p>
<p>Cause 4: Did you set BART to receive references?</p>
<p>Cause 5: If you used CrossOver Office instead of Wine, then you need to
start the Outpost manually through the CrossOver menu. It needs to be started
each time before you start Bibledit.</p>
<h4><a name="bibletimedoesnotscrollwithbibledit"/>BibleTime does not scroll with Bibledit</h4>
<p>Read some more info on <a href="./site/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:4e51bd63b0b3ac6" class="disabled">BibleTime</a>.</p>
<p>View the Logfile in the Help menu to ensure that there is a line that says
"BibleTime: Connected", and that there are no "BibleTime: " lines saying
anything wrong. If everything is right, then scrolling should occur.</p>
<p>Bibledit uses "dcop" to send scrolling commands to BibleTime. This can be
seen working by ticking menu Preferences / Debug. Then go to another verse,
view the logfile, and see a "BibleTime: dcop ..." command there. If this
command is there, then Bibledit's job has been done, and if there is still no
scrolling, the problem lies with either dcop or BibleTime. You can verify this
by executing the dcop command from a terminal and see whether BibleTime
scrolls, e.g. by typing</p>
<pre>dcop bibletime BibleTimeInterface syncAllVerseBasedModules 3John.1.8</pre>
<h4><a name="scrollingdoesnotworkwhentheoutpostrunsonanotherhost"/>Scrolling does not work when the Outpost runs on another host</h4>
<p>Some points to check:</p>
<p>1. Ensure in the Windows Outpost preferences that Bibledit can contact the
other host.</p>
<p>2. Did you start the Outpost manually on the other host? Bibledit won't be
able to start it over the network, hence Outpost needs to be started
manually.</p>
<p>3. Bibledit uses port 51515 to contact the Outpost. Ensure that this port is
opened in your firewall on Windows. If this port is closed, Bibledit can't
communicate with the Outpost.</p>
<h3><a name="exportimport"/>Export / Import</h3>
<h4><a name="itsaysthattheswordcompilerwasnotfound"/>It says that the SWORD compiler was not found</h4>
<p>The SWORD compiler is part of the SWORD API. Bibledit uses this compiler to
export a project to SWORD format.</p>
<p>The most likely problem is that you did not install SWORD from source, but
from a binary package. Binary packages do not always install the compiler. If
you install SWORD from source, or install the development version of libsword the compiler
will be installed too.</p>
<p>The compiler used is a program called osis2mod. If the compiler has been
installed, but Bibledit still cannot find it, the problem might be that the
compiler has not been installed in the program search path. Type</p>
<pre>echo $PATH</pre>
<p>in a terminal to see the program search path.</p>
<h4><a name="whileexportingtoswordalltextwithinmyspeechmarkersdisappears"/>While exporting to SWORD, all text within my speech markers disappears</h4>
<p>All text between the speech markers disappears when exporting to SWORD.
E.g.</p>
<pre>And Jesus said: &lt;&lt;I am he&gt;&gt;.</pre>
<p>Everything between &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; disappears.</p>
<p>This is a bug in the current SWORD compiler. The bug has been reported.</p>
<p>A workaround is to use the Unicode speech markers, e.g.</p>
<pre>And Jesus said: «I am he».</pre>
<h4><a name="segmentedverseslike1adonotshowinswordexport"/>Segmented verses like 1a do not show in SWORD export</h4>
<p>SWORD currently does not support segmented verses, like verse 1a. To prevent
problems Bibledit just takes any "a" or "b" out from the verse. SWORD needs to
be updated to support this.</p>
<h4><a name="markerltsomemarkergtdoesnotshowproperlyinbibletime"/>Marker &lt;some marker&gt; does not show properly in BibleTime</h4>
<p>Question: I have used the \mi formatting in the list of names in Acts 13:1.
The output to BibleTime lists the \mi paragraphs on separate lines, but the
font is changed from my default font for that language, and there is no
indenting. Under the form for editing the style for \mi, I don't see a place to
select the font. And the default indenting of each line at 6 mm from the left
seems right. So is this a problem of what Bibletime can display? (That might
explain the lack of indenting, but it seems that the font should not
change.)</p>
<p>Answer: For any marker, not only the \mi one, the output Bibledit generates
for the Sword compiler can be seen in the <a href="./site/gtk/4-management/data.html">temporary
directory</a>/sword_osis_input.txt. In this case, that of the \mi marker, it
can be seen that no indenting information is passed to BibleTime, nor any font
information.</p>
<p>This implies that the font problem is a problem of BibleTime, and that the
indenting is not done because it does not get the information needed. If
somebody knows how to pass indenting information to BibleTime, pls. let the
programmer of Bibledit know and he can put that information in.</p>
<h3><a name="logfile"/>Logfile</h3>
<h4><a name="pangowarning"/>Pango-WARNING</h4>
<p>Question: When opening Bibledit and project NIV, the logfile says
"(bibledit:7567): Pango-WARNING **: Error loading GSUB table 4097". I'm not
sure what the warning means. The project goes ahead and opens.</p>
<p>Reply: This is not an issue with Bibledit, but with the Pango library
Bibledit is using. Most likely you are using a font that Pango has a problem
with. Problems with Pango can be reported at <a href="http://www.pango.org/" rel="nofollow">www.pango.org</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="webserveraddressalreadyinuse"/>Webserver: Address already in use</h4>
<p>Remark: On starting Bibledit sometimes the logfile says "Webserver: Address
already in use".</p>
<p>Reply: This happens after Bibledit crashed and is restarted after that. The
internal webserver cannot function properly because the previous one is still
running. To solve the problem, quit and start Bibledit once more. It is hoped that as from Bibledit version 4.1 the internal webserver will have been replaced by a proper webserver such as Apache.</p><h2><a name="TOC-Printing-numerals-in-a-different-script"/>Printing numerals in a different script</h2><p>Question: How can I print the digits in Farsi script?</p><p>Answer: According to the USFM standard one can use the \cp marker to print a different number for the chapter number. And one can use the \vp markup to do the same for the verse. But this is not well supported by Bibledit. XeTeX has a "font mapping" option that allows a Unicode-&gt;Unicode TECkit mapping table to be associated with a font; by using such a mapping that converts Latindigits to Farsi ones, the \c numbers can be printed in the desired numeral system without any special preparation needed in the USFM file, and similarly for \v, page numbers, cross-references, anywhere you might want to apply it.<br/></p><p>To get this to work in Bibledit, the following is important. On Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, install package "texlive-lang-arab" and font "ttf-sil-scheherazade". The Arab package provides the TECkit mapping with the Farsi digits conversion, and the font package provides a font that has been proven to work with XeTeX. Other fonts might work as well. Once these two packages have been installed, open the Farsi text in Bibledit, and set the Arabic font in the View menu, so that the text in the editor is real Farsi. The press Ctrl-P to print, and choose the option to print via de pdf2ptx typesetter. In the Print Settings window, choose Options, and switch to the Mapping tab. Select file "farsidigits.tec". If the Arab package was installed properly, then this TECkit mapping will be available in folder /usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/polyglossia. After pressing OK, everything should work out well, and after some time the Farsi document should show up. It is important to choose the "arab" shaping engine, so that the letters and words are properly spaced. On Ubuntu there is a package called ttf-farsiweb which may have good fonts. A font called Nazli gave good results.<br/></p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/questions.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/references.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>References</h1><h3><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction</h3>

<p>Through menu Edit the Find menu can be opened. The same can be done through
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F.</p>
<p>A list of hits will show in the references window.</p>
<h2><a name="basicfind"/>Basic Find</h2>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find (Ctrl+F) searches exacty (except case sensitive) for the
sequence of characters entered into the Search for box, punctuation marks and
spaces included. Case sensitive can be switched on or off. Searching can be
limited to the current book.</p>
<p>Example: Searching for "ue. t" (without the quotation marks) shows all the
references with the words: true. The.</p>
<p>Note that for the text to actually display, you have to hit one of the
search results.</p>
<h2><a name="advancedfind"/>Advanced Find</h2>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+F) allows more complex searches than the
Basic Find:</p>
<p>* Search box to enter text.</p>
<p>* Case sensitive: on or off.</p>
<p>* Search in curent book only: this limits searching to the current book.</p>
<p>* Interprete * and ? as wildcards: on or off.</p>
<p>* Match start of word: on or off.</p>
<p>* Match end of word: on or off.</p>
<p>* Select books: some books (all), for details see <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/print/portion.html">Select books.</a></p>
<p>* Which area of the text to search in.</p>
<p>* What to do with the search results. This gives the choice how the results
will show up in the references window, see Loading results below.</p>
<p>There are two wildcards. The ? and the *. The ? means "any single
character". If one were to search for "p?t", and ticks the option for
wildcards, then the search will hit results like "pit" and "put". The * works
similar, but means "zero or more characters".</p>
<p>Searches can be done in certain areas of the text. When searching in the raw
USFM text, then one searches in the text as it is stored, e.g. one can search
for markers too, like \add. When searching in all the text except the USFM
codes, one searches in the text as it will appear on the paper when printed.
This means that searching for markers is not possible, as these will be hidden
on the paper. When searching in certain categories, one can limit searches to,
let's say, only the introductions, or only the verse text, or only headings and
identifiers, and so forth.</p>
<h2><a name="loadingresults"/>Loading results</h2>
<p>Once an advanced or BibleTime search has been done, one can decide how they
interact with what is already in the references window.</p>
<p>* The search results can simply be loaded in the references window, and so
replace anything that is already there.</p>
<p>* Or the search results can be added to the references already there.</p>
<p>* Or they can be removed from the references already loaded.</p>
<p>* Sharing the search results with what is already in the references window
means that only the references that are the same will be kept in the references
window, and the other ones will be discarded.</p>
<p>In the case that in a Special Find the option: 'Share them with the ones
already in the references window' is chosen, and this special find with this
option is repeated several times, several groups of characters can be
highlighted in the text editor (as a result from the different searches) when a
reference is activated in the references window.</p>
<h2><a name="findandreplace"/>Find and Replace</h2>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find and Replace (Ctrl+R) searches for and replaces text. It goes like this:</p><p>Press Ctrl+R to start the find &amp; replace. Enter the word to search for, and the word to replace it with. Optionally make settings like case sensitive, searching in current book and/ or chapter, or <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/print/portion.html">select the books</a> to operate on. Press Find to start the operation.<br/></p><p>A new dialog will open. It shows the verse to be affected, e.g. Esther 6:5. It also shows the original text as it is before changing.

<p>This is basically all what it involves. A more detailed description follows
below.</p>

<p>Spelling checking is switched on or off in the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/project/project-properties.html">Project properties dialog</a>. If "Check

<h4><a name="whatarecategories"/>What are categories?</h4>
<p>Styles have been divided into categories for better overview. See <a href="./site/gtk/reference/usfm.html">USFM.</a></p>
<p>The categories can be <a href="./site/gtk/reference/keyboard-accelerators.html">expanded or
collapsed.</a></p>
<p>There is a category called "Other styles". Any styles Bibledit does not
know where to put go into this category. If somebody defines his own styles,
these styles will go into this category.</p>
<h4><a name="howcanichangesomethingtothestyles"/>How can I change something to the styles?</h4>
<p>To start editing a style, check the Edit mode.</p>
<p>When there is a small tick at the left of the Edit mode, like so: √ Edit
mode, then the mode is checked, else it is unchecked.</p>
<p>Once the Edit mode is on you can start using the editing functions in the
menu.</p>
<h4><a name="howcanicreateanewstyle"/>How can I create a new style?</h4>
<p>Do it through function New.</p>
<p>If the style is known in Bibledit's templates, it will fill all the values
in for you. The values can be edited.</p>
<p>Else, after you've created the new style, edit the style.</p>
<h4><a name="howcanieditastyle"/>How can I edit a style?</h4>
<p>Through function Properties.</p>
<p>This will bring up a window where you can edit this style.</p>
<p>The style determines how the text affected by it will look once
printed.</p>
<p>All styles should speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>* Where there is the choice to span two columns, this refers to the
two-column layout normally used in a Bible. A major header normally spans
these two columns, but a minor header does not.</p>
<p>* A paragraph can be a main title, a subtitle, a section heading, a normal
paragraph, and so on. At present these settings are used during exporting a
project to SWORD.</p>
<h4><a name="howtodeleteastyle"/>How to delete a style?</h4>
<p>In the Styles Area, select the style or the styles you wish to delete, and
choose the Delete function.</p>
<h4><a name="whataretherecentlyusedstyles"/>What are the recently used styles?</h4>
<p>When a style has been inserted in the text, it will then also be displayed
in the category "Recently Used", and will be accessible from there too. A
maximum of 30 styles will be displayed. The styles are sorted on usage count,
and the most used styles appear at the top of the list.</p>
<p>When a style has been inserted in the text, it will then also be displayed
in the category "Recently Used", and will be accessible from there too.</p>
<p>These recently used styles are attached to the stylesheet. This implies
that if another stylesheet is opened, the recently used styles may change.</p>
<p>These styles can be deleted. Just select the style or styles you wish to
delete, and choose the Delete function. Or select the category itself, and
delete it.</p>
<p>If any style is deleted, and this style happens to be in the recently used
category, it will be removed from there also.</p>
<h3><a name="stylesheet"/>Stylesheet</h3>
<h4><a name="howdoiswitchtoanotherstylesheet"/>How do I switch to another stylesheet?</h4>
<p>A stylesheet can be opened through function Stylesheet - Switch.</p>
<p>The new stylesheet will be attached to the project that is open.</p>
<h4><a name="howdoicreateanewstylesheet"/>How do I create a new stylesheet?</h4>
<p>Choose function Stylesheet - New. <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/styles/stylesheet.html">More information is available</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="howdoirenameastylesheet"/>How do I rename a stylesheet?</h4>
<p>Choose function Stylesheet - Rename.</p>
<h4><a name="howcanideleteastylesheet"/>How can I delete a stylesheet?</h4>
<p>Choose function Stylesheet - Delete. A
list of available stylesheets comes up. The one currently opened is not shown
so that it cannot be deleted by accident. Select a stylesheet and press Ok.
The selected stylesheet will be deleted.</p>
<h4><a name="howtoexportorimportastylesheet"/>How to export or import a stylesheet?</h4>
<p>That's done through function Stylesheet
- Export or Stylesheet - Import.</p>
<p>A stylesheet is exported as a database. This database contains all the
individual styles that are in that stylesheet. It asks for a filename, adds
the right extension to it, and then saves the file, for example, as
"Standard.sql5".</p>
<p>This same database can be imported in Bibledit.</p>
<p>Thus stylesheets can be shared among users.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Functions that work with styles are used in various ways.</p>
<h3><a name="workinginthestylesheetwindow"/>Working in the Stylesheet window</h3>
<p>To focus the Stylesheet window, do any of the following:</p>
<p>* Choose menu File / Styles.</p>
<p>* Or click in the Stylesheet window.</p>
<p>* Or press Shift+F5 once or more until the Stylesheet window has focus.</p>
<p>* Or press Ctrl+S.</p>
<h3><a name="workingwithstyles"/>Working with styles</h3>
<p>The first thing to do when working with styles is to focus the Stylesheet
window.</p>
<p>If the categories are still collapsed you can expand them. Focus the
category and <a href="./site/gtk/reference/keyboard-accelerators.html">expand</a> it.</p>
<p>Then you can use the up or down arrows to move the cursor to a particular
style, or click on a style.</p>
<p>* Then choose menu File / Styles, and then one of the functions.</p>
<p>* Or right-click in the Stylesheet window and choose one of the functions
from the Styles pop-up menu.</p>
<p>* Or press Shift+F10 to open the Styles pop-up menu, and choose one of the
functions.</p>
<p>Double-click a style to insert it in the text, or when the Edit mode is on,
to edit this style.</p>
<p>If the focus is on a style you can press Enter to insert that style.</p>
<p>You can press Insert to create a new style, and Delete to remove a style,
provided the Edit mode is on.</p>
<h3><a name="workingwithstylesheets"/>Working with stylesheets</h3>
<p>The first thing to do when working with stylesheets is to open the
Stylesheet submenu. To do this:</p>
<p>* Choose menu File / Styles / Stylesheets, and then one of the functions.</p>
<p>* Or right-click in the Stylesheet window and choose function Stylesheets,
and then one of the functions from the Stylesheets submenu.</p>
<p>* Or in the Stylesheet window press Shift+F10 to open the Styles pop-up
menu, choose function Stylesheets and choose one of the functions in that
submenu.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/styles.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/4-management/data/backup.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/4-management/data</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Backup</h1><p>To keep your data safe, it is important to make regular backups of your

<h3><a name="obtaininganewerbibleditpackage"/>Obtaining a newer Bibledit package</h3>
<p>If the version of Bibledit that comes with your version of Debian
is not the one you prefer, or not new enough, you can install a
version from the Debian testing or Debian unstable repository.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> This is likely to be the case if you are
using Debian Lenny, the current stable Debian release as of May 2009.
The Bibledit packages in Debian testing (squeeze) and Debian unstable
(sid) are much newer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add the Debian testing repository:</p>
<ul><li>Select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Software Sources .</li><li>Select the "Third Party Applications" tab.</li><li>Select the "Add" button.</li><li>In the "Apt line:" field, enter<br/>
<tt>deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ testing main</tt></li><li>Select the "Add Source" button.</li><li>Select the "Close" button.</li><li>When a dialog about things being out of date appears, select
the "Reload" button.</li></ul>
<p>If you prefer to use a package from the Debian unstable repository,
then the "Apt line:" text should instead be</p>
<blockquote><p><tt>deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once your chosen repository is added to your system, you can add
the Bibledit package from it using the Synaptic Package Manager as
described <a href="javascript:void(0);">above</a>.  It may require
updated versions of some other packages too.  If so, these will be
automaticaly updated by Synaptic as part of the Bibledit package
installation process.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> Unless you want to update your entire
system to use everything in the repository just added, once you have
installed Bibledit, you should use System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Software
Sources and remove the repository that you just added.  Advanced users
can override this using the apt preferences file.</p></blockquote>

<ul><li><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">You can create an Applescript that will open X11 and BIbledit-Gtk in one

then double-click Script Editor. In Script Editor type:<br/></span><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt"><font face="courier new, monospace">do shell script "/usr/bin/open-x11 /opt/local/bin/bibledit-gtk"</font><br/></span><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">Then click the Compile button, and in the menu click File, then Save. Call
it Bibledit, and save it in Applications, and set the file format to

Then save it.</span></li><li><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">When a port fails to install you may need to clean all traces of it and try again. <span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6">So for example when installing bibledit fails on the dependency gdk-pixbuf2, do this:<br/></span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6"><font face="courier new, monospace">sudo port clean --all gdk-pixbuf2</font><br/></span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6"><font face="courier new, monospace">sudo port install gdk-pixbuf2</font> (the port installed successfully this time)<br/></span><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6"><font face="courier new, monospace">sudo port install bibledit</font> (continue with the normal install procedure)</span></span></li><li>You want to have keyboard input in other languages? You can use the input from the regular Mac keyboard. The fix is easy. Under X11 -&gt; Preferences..., select the Input tab and check "Follow System Keyboard Layout." That allows you to write in other languages through the regular Mac keyboard.</li><li>If errors occur during macport installing dependencies, try adding the -d flag to the command, and re-run the port command. It will then display more information.

<p>My approach uses Debian's MinGW cross-compiler. If you use a
different MinGW build environment, you should still be able to grok
this. Some Linux distributions such as Fedora and OpenSUSE even have
MinGW package repositories.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Release Notes:</p>
<ul><li>Requires Windows XP or later. Might work on 2000, but some functionality might not.</li><li><strong>You must install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit">msysgit</a> and place the Git tools in the system path. Git, a version control system, is required for proper function of Bibledit.</strong></li><li>You must install Bibledit to a NTFS partition. FAT type partitions
are experimental. You must use PortableGit if you use FAT. This means
that <strong>installing to a typical (FAT) USB stick is probably not going to work.</strong></li><li>Windows Outpost is required for printing, web browsing, and BibleWorks integration.</li><li>BibleWorks integration requires version 7 or greater</li><li>Printing requires a PDF reader (Acrobat 9 tested).</li><li>SIL/Graphite (NRSI) fonts are supported using the Graphite backend
to Pango (pango-graphite). If there is demand, future builds will
include this by default.</li></ul>
<p>Known Issues:</p>
<ul><li>Context-sensitive help buttons are broken in this build. It might even crash Bibledit.</li><li>The startup script has a bug that prevents proper startup sometimes when you restart the app.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This beta release is quite a bit more stable than previous. Give it a try!</strong>
Backup early and often. Please use this on production projects, now
that the git integration and USB/remote repositories is functional. As
with all Free Software, it comes with no warranty for suitably for any
purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without fuirther ado, here's how to build this using Debian or Ubuntu: </p>
<ol><li>apt-get install mingw32</li><li>Get mingw-configure to make the configuration for cross-compiling
much easier, however, for some reason, the Makefiles sometimes call
pkg-config themselves, so they end up getting the build system's config
and not the cross-config. You might need to temporarily make your
pkg-config point to your win32 build root. (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Cross%20compiling%20GTK%2B%20for%20Win32" rel="nofollow">http://live.gnome.org/Cross%20compiling%20GTK%2B%20for%20Win32</a>)</li><li>Create a cross-compile root directory and unpack all of the
binaries listed below into it. Set the ROOT environment variable to it.</li><li>SQLite needs a pkg-config file. Copied mine and inserted into $ROOT/lib/pkgconfig</li><li>MinGW seems to have a broken realloc in their cstdlib. Based on some possibly bad advice, I commented it out ;)</li><li>OpenSUSE/MinGW WebKit comes with RPM files that are designed for
the OpenSUSE MinGW build system. Either use OpenSUSE, or use the alien
command to convert the RPMs to tar.gz, using the '-t' flag of alien.
Once done, extract the relevant subtree into your ROOT. You will need
to modify the OpenSUSE pkg-config files to work correctly.</li><li>You need to have a native pkg-config, but /usr/bin/pkg-config needs
to report the cross-compiled pkg-config state. Suggestion: Point
/usr/bin/pkg-config at the custom pkg-config script created by
mingw-configure, and point that custom pkg-config script to
/usr/bin/pkg-config.dist</li><li>The prebuilt MinGW libxml2 doesn't have a xml2-config. Took my
system's copy and changed its prefix, placed it in the $ROOT/bin
directory. Ran configure like so:
<ul><li>XML2_CONFIG=$ROOT/bin/xml2-config ../mingw-configure --prefix=$ROOT</li><li>Unfortunately, /usr/bin/xml2-config is still hardcoded in places,
so I did a hack similar to the pkg-config one, where
/usr/bin/xml2-config points to $ROOT/bin/xml2-config  ... In light of
these 2 issues, it might make sense to add $ROOT/bin as a prefix in
your $PATH.</li></ul>
</li><li>Unless you want to cross-compile practically the entire known Gtk+ GNOME universe, grab the following binaries from <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32" rel="nofollow">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32</a> (some of them are under the dependencies directory):

Introduction</h1><p>With Bibledit several users can work on one Bible at the same time.</p>

<p>The users collaborate through the network or a USB drive.</p>

<p>Once everything has been set up, the user needs to Send/Receive the data, and the rest goes automatic. The user does not
notice the mechanics of the collaboration, it all happens under the hood.</p>

<p>There is a variety of methods for collaboration. The user who will set it
all up needs to have sufficient knowledge of information technology.</p>

<p>Bibledit stores all data locally. When collaboration is enabled, it also
connects to a central repository. Through that repository the data gets shared
between the users.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content
manager. The user does not notice that Git is used. He does not operate it.
Bibledit does it all for him. The only thing that the user notices is that the
changes introduced by the other users appear on his screen too.</p>

<p>There is a variety of repositories that can be used. Each of them has it own
use, advantages and disadvantages. First of all there is the repository that
resides on a file system. A <span style="font-weight:bold">USB flash
drive</span> can be used in this case. This flash drive can be physically moved
from one user to the other, and so on, updating each user, and getting updated
by each user. Secondly there is the repository that resides on the network. For
internal networks a simple <span style="font-weight:bold">open network
repository</span> can be used. Whosoever knows where the repository resides can
write to it. For public networks such as the internet a <span style="font-weight:bold">secure network repository</span> would be
recommended. This type of repository is locked down. Only those who have the
keys to such a repository, or a username and password, can write to it. </p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/1intro.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>2. Repository setup</h1><p>The repository is the heart or the central part of the collaboration system.
In this tutorial you will learn how to set up a repository.</p>
<p>There are several types of repositories. See the <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/1intro.html">introduction</a>. Each of them will be
described separately in this tutorial.</p>
<p>Depending on what system you use, you can either <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup/usb-flash-drive-repository-setup.html">set up a USB flash drive</a>, or <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup/open-network-repository-setup">set up an open network

Repository initialization</h1><p>Note: Newer versions of git, and Bibledit-Gtk version 4.2 and higher, no longer need what is written below.</p><p>In this tutorial you are going to see whether the repository can be cloned,
and if not, then to put some data into it, then try to clone it again to see
how it now goes.</p>

<p>Open a terminal, and issue the commands as given.</p>
<pre>cd</pre>

<p>In the tutorial about <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup.html">setting
up the repository</a>, the systems administrator had given the URL of the
repository that was created. In the current tutorial we assume a URL of
"file:///media/usbstick/repository". Of course others are possible, depending
on what type of repository you have and where it resides. For example "ssh://user@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2".</p>You need to put something into the repository. It does not matter what,
anything will do. Let's proceed and put an empty file into the repository.
Issue the commands as given:
<pre>cd</pre>
<pre>mkdir repository</pre>
<pre>cd repository</pre>
<pre>git init</pre>

<p>It will say that an empty Git repository was initialized.</p>
<pre>touch file</pre>
<pre>git add file</pre>
<pre>git commit -a -m init</pre>

<p>It will say that an initial commit was created.</p>
<pre>git push --all file:///media/usbstick/repository</pre><pre><span>    </span>or for secure network repository:</pre><pre><span>    </span>git push --all ssh://sforgeuser@.repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2</pre>

<p>It will give some information, which shows that data was written to the
repository. No errors should occur. Example:</p><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><p><span style="font-style:normal">Counting objects: 3, done.<br/>Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 198 bytes, done.<br/>Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)<br/>To ssh://warpok@tsederhana.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/tsederhana/tsederhana<br/> * [new branch]      master -&gt; master</span></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br/>

<p>Clean out the temporal directory:</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<pre>rm -rf repository</pre>

<p>Now try to clone the repository:</p>
<pre>git clone file:///media/usbstick/repository</pre><pre><span>    </span>or for secure network repostory:</pre><pre><span>    </span>git clone ssh://sforgeuser@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2</pre>

<p>It should say that an empty Git repository was created, give some more
information, and show that object were received. It is does this, and there are
no errors, then everything is fine. Your repository has been initialized. Example:</p><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><p><span style="font-style:normal">Initialized empty Git repository in /home/oreo/tsederhana/.git/<br/>remote: Counting objects: 3, done.<br/>remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)<br/>Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/3reposinit.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/4conflictres.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>4. Conflict resolution</h1><h2><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction</h2>Under normal circumstances, the users collaborate in one project. They send and receive their changes regularly. At times it may occur that two users make changes in the same chapter of text, or in the same project notes. After doing Send/Receive, a conflict may arise. Bibledit-Gtk does not know which of the two edits to take, either the edit of the first user or the edit of the second user. This is called a conflict. For Bible text, Bibledit-Gtk tries to resolve this conflict automatically, keeping one edit, and throwing away the other. But for project notes, this does not always work. Manual intervention is required to resolve this conflict.The rest of this page describes how to notice that a conflict has occurred in a project note, and how to manually resolve it.<h2><a name="TOC-Symptoms"/>Symptoms</h2>The first symptom of a conflict is that the users get the impression that the collaboration system has stopped to work properly. The users make their edits. But these edits and changes do not propagate to the other users.If a conflict is suspected, then it is good to find out about it, whether this is indeed the case. A simple way of finding out is this:1. Shut down Bibledit, and start it again. This clears the system log.2. Send and receive the project notes. Do this through menu File / Project notes / Send-Receive.3. View the system log to see whether a conflict has occurred. Do this through menu Help / System log.If there is a conflict, then the log shows something along those lines:<code>Auto-merging 78294313</code><code>CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in 78294313</code><code>Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code>The log shows that there is a conflict. Notice the number: 78294313. This is the number of the project note that has the conflict.<h2><a name="TOC-Resolution"/>Resolution</h2>There are several ways to resolve the conflict. A simple one is described below. It just throws away the edits that one user made, and takes the edits that the other users made. In other words, it takes the version that is already on the server, in the remote repository.The user who has the conflict does the following:Opens a terminal, and types the following series of commands, one by one, and presses Enter after each command:<code>cd</code><code>cd .bibledit</code><code>cd notes</code><code>cd data</code><code>git checkout --theirs 78294313</code>Notice that the number of the note that has the conflict is 78294313. This only works in this example. Your note number will be different. The note number was found above.Close the terminal.Start doing the sending and receiving in Bibledit-Gtk as usual. Collaboration should work again. You may view the system log, as described above, to ascertain that everything works well again.</div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/4conflictres.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/notes/bible-notes.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials/notes</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Bible notes</h1><h2><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction</h2>A Bible note is a note that goes in the Biblical text. It can be a footnote, or a cross reference, or an endnote.<br/><h2><a name="TOC-Inserting"/>Inserting</h2>
<p>Bible notes can be inserted manually by applying an appropriate note style.
For example, if the "f Footnote" style is applied, then a <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-none/insert-footnote-endnote-crossreference.html">window</a> comes up allowing insertion of
this footnote. The same applies to endnotes and crossreferences.</p>
<h3><a name="editing"/>Editing</h3>
<p>Bible notes are marked by a asterisk or character in the editor. Its text is
visible at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>The asterisk corresponds to no caller (-), the characters to automatic
callers or a given caller in the text.</p>
<p>Removing a note works as you would remove any text.</p>
<p>Notes can be cut and paste in a text (which is only useful in the same
verse, if a verse-reference (\fr or \xo) is included.</p>
<p>While editing a note, pressing Page Up takes you back to the main body of
text, to the place where the footnote starts.</p>
<h3><a name="printing"/>Printing</h3>
<p>If a project is printed, it will show the footnotes, endnotes, and
crossreferences. Printing a list of references does not.</p>
<h4><a name="placement"/>Placement</h4>
<p>Footnotes and crossreferences normally appear at the bottom of the page,
inside the column they belong to.</p>
<p>Endnotes normally are printed at the end of all other text. This can be
changed in the stylesheet. Edit the style for \fe to change that. The other
options are to print them at the end of each book, or upon encountering a
certain marker in the text.</p>
<p>Placing endnotes upon encountering a certain marker is the most flexible
option. It allows endnotes to be placed exactly where you want them. If this
option is switched on, it normally places them where marker \zendnotes is found
in the text. You can insert the \zendnotes anywhere, and notes collected thus
far will be dumped there. The \zendnotes marker can be repeated as often as you
wish. The \zendnotes marker needs to be typed by hand because it is not in the
stylesheet.</p>
<h4><a name="caller"/>Caller</h4>
<p>A Bible note has a caller. The style of the caller can be set in the
markers, see <a href="./site/gtk/reference/usfm.html">USFM</a> under marker \f. For crossreferences
set it under marker \x.</p>
<p>A "+" prints a caller with automatic numbering, a "-" prints no caller at
all, and any other character prints that character as a caller.</p>
<p>The automatic numbering can be influenced in the stylesheet, under marker f
for footnotes and under marker x for crossreferences. The numbering 1, 2, 3 ...
should be clear, and the numbering a, b, c ... follows the alphabet, and after
reaching the z it starts all over again. A user defined numbering sequence can
be given too. When for example §†* is given there, the numbering goes like
§, †, *, §, †, *, and so forth. Any sequence of characters can be
used.</p>
<p>Optionally the automatic numbering can be restarted every chapter or
book.</p>
<p>The automatic numbering of endnotes is restarted whenever the notes are
printed, either at the end of the book, the end of everything, or upon
encountering a certain marker. See the style \fe to set this.</p>
<h4><a name="paragraph"/>Paragraph</h4>
<p>For a footnote, the \ft style has a full paragraph setting in the
stylesheet. Here you can set how the normal footnote paragraph is going to
look. For a crossreference, set the style under marker \xt.</p>
<p>For a new paragraph in the footnote, the style can be set under the \fp
marker.</p><br/></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/notes/bible-notes.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/notes/project-notes.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials/notes</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Project notes</h1><h2><a name="TOC-General"/>General</h2>
<p>During the process of translation many notes will be made that related to
the project.</p>
<p>Project notes are stored in a database, and are independent of any Bible

same.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Creating-and-editing-project-notes"/>Creating and editing project notes</h2><h3><a name="creatingandeditingprojectnotes"/></h3>
<p>To make a new project note press Ctrl+N.</p>
<p>To edit an existing project note click on the blue reference(s) for that
note.</p>
<p>When creating a new note or editing an existing one, the project notes
window splits up into two so as to make space for a couple of controls.</p>
<p>Project notes can be deleted by clicking on the blue [delete] link.</p>
<p>Some keyboard shortcuts help while editing notes. An example will show how:
The user edits the text of a project. To make a new note, he presses Ctrl+N. He
types some text in the note. If he wishes to change to category of the note, he
presses Alt+A, then Enter to open the list of categories, then he makes a
selection with Up Arrow or Down Arrow and presses Enter to confirm the
selection. If he wishes to add some references, he pressed Alt+R and types some
references. Alt+O saves the note, and takes the user back to where he was
editing the text. Ctrl-I puts the text in italics, Ctrl-B makes it bold, and
Ctrl-U underlines it.</p>
<p>When a project note is being edited, the creator of the note can be
retrieved through menu View / More information on current note. Other
information about this note is visible there as well, like the date it was
created, and when it was edited.</p>
<p>Each note falls into a category. The various categories and the default
category can be set in the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/project-notes.html">preferences</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Finding-project-notes"/>Finding project notes</h2><h3><a name="findingprojectnotes"/></h3>
<p>Menu / Edit / Find in Project notes (Alt+E, N) allows to do Simple searches
in the Project notes.</p>
<p>This tool searches exacty (except case sensitive) for the sequence of
characters entered into the "Search for" box, punctuation marks and spaces
included. Case sensitive can be switched on or off.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Navigating-to-the-references-of-a-note"/>Navigating to the references of a note</h2><h3><a name="navigatingtothereferencesofanote"/></h3>
<p>Project notes usually have one reference. This is the one for which the note
was created. But additional references can be added as well.</p>
<p>These references are shown attached to each note.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get these notes into the references window.</p>
<p>1. Open a note to edit it. In the menu choose Edit - Get references from
project note.</p>
<p>2. Click on the blue word [references] of a note.</p>
<p>As a result the references will be loaded in the references window. Once
there they can be activated and the text belonging to that reference will
appear in the text editor.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Transferring-text-from-the-text-editor-into-the-project-notes"/>Transferring text from the text editor into the project notes</h2><h3><a name="transferringtextfromthetexteditorintotheprojectnotes"/></h3>
<p>Many people have one project with the actual text, and a separate project
for their project notes. There is a historical reason for doing so. This
separate project may have checking questions, answers from native helpers, a
history of different renderings, commentary support, notes following consultant
checks, and so on.</p>
<p>It would be a lot of work to copy and paste these notes into the project
notes one verse at a time.</p>
<p>The tool "Transfer text to project", under the Tools menu, helps you with
this.</p>
<p>It transfers all text that is in the currently opened project into the
project notes.</p>
<p>It takes a good while to do this.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Notes-overlapping-chapters"/>Notes overlapping chapters</h2><h3><a name="notesoverlappingchapters"/></h3>
<p>If project notes need to overlap the chapter boundaries, the reference can
be manually entered like, for example: Luke 2:2-3:3. Bibledit will divide this
into two parts: Luke 2 verse 2 to the end of the chapter, and Luke 3 verse 1 to
3.</p>
<h2><a name="TOC-Showing-notes"/>Showing notes</h2><h3><a name="showingnotes"/></h3>
<p>The <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/view/project-notes.html">settings for which notes to show

<h2><a name="TOC-Exporting-notes"/>Exporting notes</h2><h3><a name="exportingnotes"/></h3>
<p>Project notes can be exported into some formats.</p>
<p>* Bibledit Notes version 3. This is the format used by the current version
of Bibledit. In other words, notes exported through this option can be imported
in Bibledit.</p>
<p>* ScriptureNotes version 2.0. Notes exported in this format can be imported
by Translation Notes Editor 6.0.</p>
<p>To see how these formats looks, just export some text and open the exported
text in a text editor.</p><h2><a name="TOC-Sharing-notes"/>Sharing notes</h2><p>The notes that you make on your computer can be shared with other members of the team. These notes you make will then also be available to the members of the team, and the notes made by any member of the team will also become available to you. </p><p>You can set the sharing up through the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/dialog-remote-repository.html">Remote Repository Assistant</a>. Normally this assistant sets up project sharing. But it can also set up notes sharing. Just make the appropriate selection at the start of the assistant. It will be good to read the entire section about <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration.html">Collaboration</a> if you need to set it up, since it fully explains the technical details.</p><p>Notes are stored in flat files, but selected from an index. If the index for some reason gets corrupted or out of sync, then you can recreate it by either deleting the index manually from directory ~/.bibledit/notes and then restarting Bibledit, or by setting the sharing up again through the remote repository assistant.</p><p>Menu File - Project notes - Send / Receive to a manual sync of your notes with the remote repository.

Bibledit and BibleTime.</p>

<p>Bibledit can search in BibleTime modules. Needs BibleTime version 1.5.2 or

Markers.</p>

<p>The checks got a book-selection and options dialog.</p>

<p>Shutting down Bibledit immediately after opening a freshly created project
could take more than five minutes because Bibledit was indexing that project.

Bibledit starts.</p>

project.</p>

<p>A problem with autocompletion in the find functions was solved.</p>

<p>The character inventory also gives the hexadecimal notation of a

labour.</p>

<p>Improvements in the user interface.</p>

<p>Improvements in the USFM import routines.</p>

<p>A bug was fixed in the marker validation check.</p>

<p>The text storage and retrieval engine was upgraded for higher speed.</p>

<p>A bug was fixed in the Bible notes processing when a note contained unmarked
text.</p>

<p>When exporting to BibleWorks, which does not handle combined verses,
Bibledit converts combined verses to simple ones.</p>

<p>Bibledit Windows Outpost version 1.6 prevents BibleWorks from copying its
verses to the clipboard when scrolling with Bibledit.</p>

<p>The project notes database was upgraded.</p>

<p>Internal changes were made to reduce the memory usage.</p>

<p>Every Bible in the Parallel Bible will be printed using its own preferred
font.</p>

<p>Imports Hebrew text with vowels and cantillation marks from
http://www.mechon-mamre.org.</p>

<p>Can cut visually ordered Hebrew text into shorter lines for better
printouts.</p>

<p>The font size can be set in several printouts, like the parallel Bible,
references, changes.</p>

<p>Text that would go in a new paragraph, according to the stylesheet, now is
written in that new paragraph, in the parallel Bible.</p>

<p>A Word Inventory was added.</p>

<p>A bug was solved that cut off the last digit of a verse number, in case the
verse did not have text. This occurred in printing a project and export to
Sword.</p>

<p>Bug fix: Keeping an arrow key pressed down in the text area for a longer
time caused the navigation system to be mixed up.</p>

<p>The line height can be set for the printouts.</p>

<p>A bug in the synchronization of BART with Bibledit was solved, if the
navigation keys were kept pressed down and repeated.</p>

<p>Bug fix: New text added to the very end of a Bible note was not saved.</p>

<p>When Bibledit starts, and another instance of Bibledit is already running,
it will give a message, and refuse to run.</p>

<p>The available styles are now divided into 20 categories.</p>

<p>Improved inserting of the styles w, wg and wh.</p>

<p>Shows a maximum of 30 styles in the Recently Used category.</p>

<p>Project notes are now sorted not only on the first reference, but on any
additional ones as well.</p>

<p>Project notes allow for references that span the chapter boundary.</p>

<p>When Bibledit stores a line of text, any line that does not start with a
backslash is joined to the previous one, in agreement with the USFM
standard.</p>

<p>Runs on x86_64 operating systems.</p>

<p>The index was removed, because the new text retrieval engine is so fast that
the index is not needed anymore, and the indexer was slow anyway.</p>

<p>Can limit searches to the the currently opened chapter.</p>

<p>The speed of advanced searching was drastically improved.</p>

<p>Faster highlighting of searchwords in case of a basic search. Noticeable in
very long verses.</p>

<p>Searching in areas only highlights results in those areas, no longer results

<p>You can export the data from Bibledit. All export is done from the Export
Assistant. See menu File / Export. You can export a Bible, or the References,
or a Stylesheet, among other things.</p>
<h3><a name="exportabible"/>Export a Bible</h3>
<h4><a name="unifiedstandardformatmarker"/>Unified Standard Format Marker</h4>
<p>In case that you export everything, it will ask you to select a directory to
put all the USFM files in. Bibledit will put one USFM file per book into that
directory. Or if the export if compressed, all the files will be stored in a
zipped archive.</p>
<p>In case that you export only the changes, matters are slightly different.
This only exports the changes since last time you did this, or since a certain
date and time. This can be chosen.</p>
<h4><a name="bibleworksversiondatabasecompiler"/>BibleWorks Version Database Compiler</h4>
<p>When exporting a Bible to BibleWorks Version Database Compiler, a text file
is produced that can be imported in the BibleWorks Version Database Compiler
for display in BibleWorks. See the BibleWorks online help for detailed
information.</p>
<h4><a name="openscriptureinformationstandard"/>Open Scripture Information Standard</h4>
<p>An attempt is made to produce a valid OSIS file. The standard transformation
is the recommended one. Or if the OSIS file is going to be used for creating a
Go Bible, you can produce a variant for the Go Bible Creator.</p>
<h4><a name="crosswiresword"/>Crosswire SWORD</h4>
<p>When exporting to a SWORD module, the module is created and installed
straightaway. Normally Bibledit will install the SWORD module to subdirectory
.sword in the home directory, but this can be changed. Provide a name for the
module and export it. After restarting the Sword enabled Bible reader, the
module should be visible in the program.</p>
<p>While creating a Sword module, <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/export-assistant/sword-module.html">some settings
need to be made.</a></p>
<p>Module path is the directory where a zipped module will be stored. This
module is fit for immediate distribution.</p>
<p>Exporting to SWORD produces an intermediate OSIS file, which is placed in
the home directory. This file will be compiled by osis2mod, the SWORD
compiler.</p>
<p>Currently there are two methods for exporting to an OSIS file and a Sword
module. There is the "Old method". This divides the text into books, chapters
and verses. Then there's the "Recommended transformation". This divides the
text into books, sections and paragraphs. At the moment of writing the osis2mod
compiler is not capable of producing a proper Sword module out of the OSIS file
created with the new method.</p>
<p>If one method fails to produce the result that you'd like to see, try the
other one.</p>
<p>You can also export to an OSIS variant that is fit for the Go Bible
Creator.</p>
<h4><a name="opendocument"/>OpenDocument</h4>
<p>This will ask you where to save the file, and then does the export. The file
can be opened in the various wordprocessors that support OpenDocument, such as
AbiWord, KWord, OpenOffice, etc. The main purpose of this export is to be able
to transfer the formatted text into other applications. For that reason several
style settings, like two columns, are unsupported.</p>
<p>It makes use of a template. This template is a simple document in
OpenDocument format. Under normal circumstances this template is stored at
/usr/share/bibledit-gtk/template.odt. If you really like to change the OpenDocument
export, you can modify the template.</p>
<h4><a name="gobible"/>Go Bible</h4>
<p>This will create a Go Bible. It runs on a cell phone. You need to have a
working Java runtime environment. This can be installed through your

It can import
a variety of data into Bibledit. The various options are described below.</p>
<h3><a name="importabible"/>Import a Bible</h3>
<p>Bibledit can import existing Biblical text. It imports various formats of
the texts. These formats are described below.</p>
<h4><a name="bibleunifiedstandardformatmarkers"/>Bible - Unified Standard Format Markers</h4>
<p>Bibledit can import <a href="./site/gtk/reference/usfm.html">USFM</a> text.</p>
<p>If it says that a file is not in Unicode, it is recommended to open this
file in gedit, and then save it in UTF-8 format. The program "gedit" is an
editor that comes with Linux. Other editors will work well too.</p>
<h4><a name="biblebibleworksexporteddatabase"/>Bible - BibleWorks Exported Database</h4>
<p>Bibledit can import text that has been exported from BibleWorks. This is how
to do it: In BibleWorks choose Tools - Export Database. Export the Bible of
your choice to a file and save it in Text format. Then do the Import in
Bibledit.</p>
<h4><a name="bibleonlinebibletext"/>Bible - Online Bible Text</h4>
<p>Data from the Online Bible can be imported. Bibledit contacts the Online
Bible and retrieves data from it.</p>
<p>To get this to work, it is important to ensure that the Online Bible and
Bibledit share their reference. If this works, it means that Bibledit can
contact the Online Bible.</p>
<p>The Import Assistant has an option to import data from the Online Bible.
After you choose this option, the Assistant will check that it can contact the
Online Bible. If this is the case, the next step is to choose which Bible of
the Online Bible to import. After that the import starts. </p>
<p>Import will take a very long time due to how the interface has been
built.</p>
<p>You can cancel the import at any time. Whatever has been imported will be
preserved. When continuing with the import next time, whatever has been
imported already will not be imported again. That saves time.</p>
<h4><a name="biblerawtext"/>Bible - Raw Text</h4>
<p>Importing raw text involves manual labour. The following steps would be
required:</p>
<p>1. View the USFM code. This can be done through menu View / USFM code, or
keyboard accelerator Ctrl-\ (Control-Backslash).</p>
<p>2. Switch on the USFM checker. See menu Check / USFM. This opens a new
window.</p>
<p>3. Paste some good text in the editor.</p>
<p>4. Press button "Discover markup", and see how it goes.</p>
<p>If the markup is not discovered properly, you will need to enter the USFM
codes by hand. The essential ones are \c, \p, \s and \v.</p>
<p>Keep doing this for each chapter of text you'd like to import. </p>
<p>At the end of all, when all text has been imported into a book, chapter 0
needs to be set as well, else without that Bibledit won't work well with the
imported text. Setting chapter 0 is usually done by simply applying the "c"
marker in the editor, choosing chapter 0, and pressing OK.</p>
<p>Note. At any stage in the text import process, the user can filter the text.
Select the filter to apply, then click button "Filter text". Filters can be
created through menu <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters.html">Preferences /
Filters</a>.</p>
<p>Note. There is an option "Verses are at line start". if this one is ticked,
when discovering the markup, the engine only considers verses that are at the
start of the line.</p>
<p>Note. In some raw text footnotes or cross references are included in the
text. See the following example, where one would like to import the following
raw text:</p>
<p>"5 Don't forget what happened to those people that the Lord rescued from
Egypt. Some of them did not have faith, and he later destroyed them. Ex 12.51;
Nu 14.29,30. 6 You also know about the angels who didn't do their work and left
their proper places. God chained them with everlasting chains and is now
keeping them in dark pits until the great day of judgment."</p>
<p>There is a cross reference in 5: Ex 12.51; Nu 14.29,30.</p>
<p>To import this raw text properly, you need to tick the option that the verse
numbers are at the start of the line. Then recognize the text by clicking on
the button. It will now have recognized only verse 5. You need to put a new
line before verse 6, and manually add the \v before it. The switch to formatted
view, and cut the cross reference to the clipboard. Then insert a new cross
reference, and paste that text into the dialog.</p>
<p>The same technique can be used for footnotes or endnotes.</p>

<h3><a name="useremoterepository"/>Use remote repository</h3>
<p>This setting allows several people to work together on one project.</p>
<p>Several other settings have to be made, as described below.</p>
<h3><a name="tryingoutthecontenttracker"/>Trying out the content tracker</h3>
<p>The setup assistant will test the content tracker, whether it is able to
perform everything that is needed. Normally the test passes, and you can go
forward.</p>
<h3><a name="actionselector"/>Action selector</h3>
<p>In the next page select which action you'd like to take. For a first
repository setup, the default action should be chosen.</p>
<h3><a name="repository"/>Repository</h3>
<p>This is the URL of the repository that Bibledit is going to use. Your system
administrator should give you the URL that ought to be filled in here.</p>
<p>Example URLs:</p>
<p>git://biblerepository.com/projects/myproject</p>
<p>git://localhost/repository</p>
<p>file:///home/joe/repositories/myproject</p>
<p>The path should point to an already existing repository, created by the
system administrator.</p>
<p>If the repository has been set, the dialog will indicate whether read access
to the repository has been granted.</p>
<h3><a name="clonerepository"/>Clone repository</h3>
<p>Press the button to clone the remote repository.</p>
<h3><a name="writeaccess"/>Write access</h3>
<p>If write access has been granted, then things should work fine.</p>
<h3><a name="pushtorepository"/>Push to repository</h3>
<p>Normally this step will be skipped. But if you really like your data to be
pushed into the repository, or if the repository is still empty, then press the
button to push your data to the repository. Use with care because it wipes out
anything in the repository, and replaces it with your data.</p><h3><a name="updatefrequency"/></h3>
<h3><a name="conflicthandling"/>Conflict handling</h3>
<p>When two users make changes in one line in one verse, and the changes are
not compatible, then a conflict will occur. Bibledit will resolve this conflict
for you. Settings for that are made in this dialog. You can give preference to
"the local data". This means that the data of the other user is lost. Or you
can give preference to "the data in the remote repository". This means that
your own changes will be overwritten with the changes that are on the server,
which actually means that the changes the other user made overwrite your own
changes.</p>
<p>When two users make changes in different verses of the same chapter, at the
same time, Bibledit will merge those changes.</p>

<h3><a name="general"/>General</h3>
<p>It creates, edits and deletes filters.</p>
<p>Creating a new filter is simple. Just press button "New", type a name for
the filter, choose the type of the filter, and press OK.</p>
<p>Deleting an existing filter is simple too. Select the filter, then press
"Delete".</p>
<p>Editing a filter is another simple matter. Select the filter, and type the
rules in the Rules window. More about the rules later on.</p>
<p>A filter can be tried out. Press the "Try" button to do that. The text at
the left of the button is passed through the filter, and then becomes visible
at the right side. Any errors show up there too. The text at the left of the
button can be changed to anything.</p>
<h3><a name="rules"/>Rules</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of the filter, there are various programs that run
the rules.</p>
<h4><a name="sedrules"/>Sed rules</h4>
<p>The program "sed" is used for operating the filter. Sed is a Stream
EDitor. It takes the input text, passes it through one or more rules, and
then outputs it, modifying it on the fly. The modifications are done
according to the rules that have been given.</p>
<p>More help about creating rules is in the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/sed.html">sed rules</a> reference, and in the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/regex">regular expressions</a> reference.
A wealth of information about sed, and the rules to write, is available at <a href="http://sed.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">sed.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="teckitmapping"/>TECkit mapping</h4>
<p>The TECkit package is used for running the filter. TECkit is a toolkit for
conversion of data to Unicode. Bibledit uses it only for converting Unicode
to Unicode. The package takes the input text, passes it through a set of
mapping rules, and then outputs it, modifying it on the fly.</p>
<p>More help about creating the mapping rules is in the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/tec.html">TECkit mapping rules</a>
reference. More information is available from SIL through the <a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/index.html" rel="nofollow">computing index</a>, or more
specifically at the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;cat_id=TECkit" rel="nofollow">TECkit
home page</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="freescript"/>Free script</h4>
<p>A free script is used for running the filter. A free script means any
script that you can give and that will run in the shell. Here is an example
of a very basic script, one that really doesn't filter at all, it only shows
how to write a script:</p>
<pre>cat inputfile &gt; outputfile</pre>
<p>Bibledit searches for a text "inputfile", and replaces that with the input
data. It also searches for text "outputfile", and replaces that with the
output data. The script then is passed to the shell, and runs there. The
output data is then read again and used.</p>
<p>The above script just takes the input file and copies that to the output
file.</p>
<p>Any custom script that you made will do here, in any language. The only
thing that is important is that the texts "inputfile" and "outputfile" are
there. And of course that the script does something sensible.</p>
<h3><a name="notes"/>Notes</h3>
<p>While the USFM text is ran through the filter, an attempt is made that the
USFM codes themselves will not be changed. To protect these codes from being
changed, the codes are temporally changed into numbers. The assumption here
is that the user will not write filters that change numbers. After filtering
the numbers are changed back to the original USFM codes again. This process
is transparent to the user, that is, the user does not notice that it
happens. This process will work well only if the filters don't change the
numbers.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/planning-setup.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Planning</h1><p>This dialog is accessible through the menu / Preferences / Planning..</p>

<p>The various tidying functions are described below.</p>
<h3><a name="translatecertaintexttobookabbreviations"/>Translate certain text to book abbreviations</h3>
<p>While inserting references, one might prefer to type, for example "Matthew
1.1". References are usually given in their abbreviated form in the
footnotes. Therefore, it should be, for example, "Mat. 1.1". This translate
function can do that for you. To make it work for the Matthew case, ensure
that this function is ticked, scroll the llist of abbreviations down till you
reach the Matthew abbreviation, click on the abbreviation, then click at the
right side of it under the Texts column. The text now becomes editable. Enter
"Matthew", and press Enter.</p>
<p>If you wish to enter several texts that all translate to the abbreviation
of Matthew, type them this way: Matthew | Matth. | Mt.. This means that
"Matthew", or "Matth." or "Mt." all get tidied to your language's
abbreviation of the book of Matthew.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/tidy-text.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/user-interface.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences.html</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>User interface</h1><p>The dialog for making settings for the user interface is accessible through

<h3><a name="features"/>Features</h3>
<p>Bibledit can be set to be a more advanced tool, or a tool with fewer
options. In this way the features that Bibledit offers can be tailored to the
user's needs. There are various settings for this.</p>
<p>1. When Bibledit is set with only the basics available, it becomes a very
simple Bible editor. It has all user defined features switched off. See below
for the user defined features.</p>
<p>2. When Bibledit is set with all features available, it becomes a most
powerful Bible editor.</p>
<p>3. When Bibledit is set with user defined features, the user can set which
of the features are to be switched on.</p>
<p>If for example all features are ticked, except of "Project management", then
the user cannot manage a project, that is, the user cannot change projects, add
or delete them.</p>
<p>If for example the "Project notes" are unticked, then the user cannot view
or edit project notes.</p>
<p>There is a whole lot of other features that can be switched on or off. The
best way to see how this works is just switch these off or on and see for
yourself how Bibledit looks.</p>
<h3><a name="detachedwindows"/>Remembering most recent verse</h3>
<p>There is an option to remember the most recent verse per chapter. When this
option is ticket, it may affect navigation. An example will show how it
works.</p>
<p>Let us imagine that the user works in Matthew 2:5. Bibledit will record that
the most recent verse in Matthew 2 is verse 5. Next the user goes to Matthew
3:10. Bibledit will again record that the most recent verse in Matthew 3 is
verse 10. When the user now instructs Bibledit to go to Matthew chapter 2,
Bibledit will remember that the most recent verse in chapter 2 was verse 5. It
will therefore go straight to verse 5. When the option is disabled, it would
have gone to verse 1. Bibledit will also record that the most recent chapter in
Matthew is chapter 2. If the user goes to John, then instructs Bibledit to go
to Matthew, Bibledit will remember the most recent chapter and verse for
Matthew, and will go straight to Matthew 2:5.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/user-interface.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/windows-outpost.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences.html</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Windows Outpost</h1><p>The Windows Outpost Setup dialog allows you to make various settings for the
Outpost.</p>
<h3><a name="usingwindowsoutpost"/>Using Windows Outpost</h3>
<p>If "Use Windows Outpost" has been ticked, Bibledit will try to use the
Outpost. If you don't use the Outpost, untick this option.</p>
<p>If the Outpost is used, more settings follow below.</p>
<h3><a name="findingoutpostandwineorcrossoveroffice"/>Finding Outpost and Wine or CrossOver Office</h3>
<p>A number of buttons are available that aid you in locating the version of
Wine or CrossOver Office that Bibledit will use to run the Outpost.</p>
<p>The "Select" button allows you to select which Wine / CrossOver Office
program to use, in case more than one was found.</p>
<p>The "Open" button allows you to manually choose a binary for Wine /
CrossOver Office.</p>
<p>The "Find" button will search through your whole system to find programs of
Wine / CrossOver Office. This may take a long time, depending on the amount of
data on your hard disk.</p>
<h3><a name="networkingwindowsoutpost"/>Networking Windows Outpost</h3>
<p>Normally the Outpost runs on the same computer where Bibledit runs. But
there are cases that users wish to use resources that are installed on another
computer or on a virtual machine. To use the Outpost this way, tick the option
that the Outpost runs on another host, and enter the name of that host. If you
know the name of that host, enter it, for example "windows" (without the
quotes). Or if you know the IP number of that host, enter that.</p>
<p>Bibledit will now check whether that host is accessible.</p>
<p>If the Outpost runs on another host, Bibledit will not be able to
automatically start the Outpost. You need to start the Outpost manually on that
other host, and then start Bibledit. Bibledit will try to establish a
connection with it. The file bwoutpost.exe is in the bibledit source package in subdirectory outpost. There is no installation program, but you can just drag the bwoutpost.exe to the start button, and start it from there.<br/></p>
<h3><a name="bottle"/>Bottle</h3>
<p>You can enter a bottle to be used for the Outpost. This bottle is not used
for plain wine, but it is used for CrossOver Office. If you install a certain
Windows program in a certain bottle in CrossOver Office, enter this same bottle

<p>Opinions vary on whether origin references in footnotes and
crossreferences are useful. Some say that they are useful because they
indicate the verse to which the note belongs. Others say that these
references are just clutter and that the information is clearer without
them.</p>
<p>A tool is available that can add or remove the origin references of all
the Bible Notes in one go.</p>
<p>See the <a href="./site/gtk/reference/usfm.html">USFM</a> documentation for footnotes,
endnotes and crossreferences for a
description of what the origin references are.</p>
<p>In the dialog, tick what type of notes to affect: footnotes, endnotes,
crossreferences, or a combination of them. If you tick "Footnotes", for
example, and leave the others unticked, then only the footnotes in your
project will be affected.</p>
<p>Then choose the action you wish to take, whether to give statistics only,
or whether to add the origin references or to remove them.</p>
<p>If you add them, you can set how the origin references will look.</p>
<p>Once all settings are made, press OK to process all verses in your
project.</p>
<p>Changes that Bibledit will now make cannot be made undone.</p>
<p>Statistics of what has been found and what has been done will be given
once through.</p>
<p>Sometimes Bible notes don't have any markers in them at all, they are just
plain text. To add the default markers to the note, choose option "Add
missing text labels".</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/tools/bible-notes-mass-update.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/tools/generate-word-lists.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/tools</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Generate Word lists</h1><h3><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction</h3>
<p>The dialog to generate the word lists is available through the menu, Tools,
Generate word lists.</p>
<p>It generates a general word list, a list of Hebrew words, and one of Greek
words.</p>
<p>It goes through all the data in the project, collects the entries which have
been marked, and then inserts the lists at a location defined by the user. Thus
it can generate a glossary or topical index.</p>
<h3><a name="settings"/>Settings</h3>
<p>There are three possible lists: a general word list, a Hebrew word lists,
and a Greek word list.</p>
<p>For each of these lists there are some options that the user can set:</p>
<p>- Process word list: whether to process this particular word list.</p>
<p>- Add an asterisk to each entry, see below.</p>
<p>- Add the asterisk only to the first time this particular entry occurs in
the section, see below.</p>
<h3><a name="operation"/>Operation</h3>
<p>Generating word lists is simple assuming that the right markers are already
in the data: Just set the options, click button OK, and wait till it is
through.</p>
<h3><a name="entries"/>Entries</h3>
<p>The word list generator uses the entries that are in the data to collect the
words to insert in the list.</p>
<p>An entry for the general word list is inserted between the \w and the \w*
markers. The Hebrew and Greek word lists use similar markers. See the <a href="javascript:void(0);">USFM</a> documentation for full details</p>
<p>When the word list generator runs, it will remove any asterisks (*) that
were appended to the word. When the option "Add an asterisk to each word entry"
has been selected, it will then add an asterisk after the word. If the option
"the first time it occurs in a section" has been selected also, it will only
add the asterisk where this particular entry occurs for the first time in the
section. In this case, if for example the word "talent" occurs several times in
a section, it will be given as "talent*" the first time, with the asterisk, and
as "talent" the other times, without an asterisk. The section headings define
the size of a section.</p>
<h3><a name="lists"/>Lists</h3>
<p>The lists of words can be inserted once or more than once in the data. The
general word list will be inserted between the markers \zopenwordlist and
\zclosewordlist. These markers ought to be on a separate line. If this couple
of markers occurs in several places, the word lists will be inserted in several
places too. If it occurs once, only one list will be generated, and if it does
not occur at all, no list will be generated.</p>
<p>Any entries that are already between those markers will be preserved. If
there are entries between those markers, and there is no corresponding entry in
the text, this entry will be commented out.</p>
<p>List of usfm markers that indicate the position of a word list:</p>
<pre>\zopenwordlist<br/>\zclosewordlist<br/>\zopengreekwordlist<br/>\zclosegreekwordlist<br/>\zopenhebrewwordlist<br/>\zclosehebrewwordlist</pre>
<p>The markers that open and close a word list will need to be manually typed
in the text at the right location. They are not part of the stylesheet.</p>
<h3><a name="example"/>Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following situation:</p>
<p>The text contains the following general word list entries: Hallelujah, Rabi,
Pentecost.</p>
<p>At some place of the data, the list should be inserted, but it already
contains some entries:</p>
<pre>\zopenwordlist<br/>\p Hallelujah: Praise the Lord<br/>\p Rabi: Teacher<br/>\p Mamon<br/>\zclosewordlist</pre>
<p>After running the word list generator, it will look so:</p>
<pre>\zopenwordlist<br/>\p Hallelujah: Praise the Lord<br/>\rem Mamon<br/>\p Pentecost<br/>\p Rabi: Teacher<br/>\zclosewordlist</pre>
<p>Note the following: (1) the existing entries have been preserved, (2) a new
one has been added, (3) one has been commented out, and (4) the entries have
been sorted alphabetically.</p>
<p>Note also that any text before the first colon (:) is considered to be the
actual entry. If there is no colon, then the whole text will be considered the
entry.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/tools/generate-word-lists.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/tools/transfer-project-notes-to-text.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/tools</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Transfer Project Notes to text</h1><p>The tool can be accessed through menu / Tools / Transfer project notes to
text.</p>
<p>This tool does only one thing. It copies the project notes into the
currently opened project.</p>
<p>It does that by going through each verse of the project that is now opened
in the editor. At each verse it looks at which project notes would display if
that verse were visible in the editor. It then copies the text of those notes
into the text of the project. It the text of a note is copied into the
project, it does not overwrite the data that is already in the project, but
it just appends it.</p>
<p>This tool can be useful in cases that somebody wishes to have some way of
printing a subset of project notes along with the text, so that checking
questions could be printed on the same page as the verses they refer to. To
do this, the notes can be imported in some temporal project, and then a
"Parallel Bible" could be created that includes that temporal project that
now contains the notes.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/tools/transfer-project-notes-to-text.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/view/outline.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/view</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Outline</h1><p>Bibledit shows the outline of the book that is being edited.</p>

<p>In this dialog settngs can be made that influence which project notes are
displayed, and how they are displayed.</p>
<p>The top part of the dialog deals with the notes selection, that is, which
notes will be selected for display.</p>
<p>The bottom part of the dialog deals with the notes display, that is, how
the notes will be displayed.</p>
<h3><a name="notesselection"/>Notes selection</h3>
<p>A note must satisfy four conditions to be selected for displaying.</p>
<p>The first condition to be satisfied is which reference or references the
note belongs to.</p>
<p>The second condition is the date on which the note has been edited.</p>
<p>The third condition is the category to which the note belongs.</p>
<p>The fourth condition is the project to which the note belongs.</p>
<p>For example if you wish to select all the notes in the current chapter
that have been edited today, then tick these conditions: "Notes that have the
current chapter", and "Notes edited today", and "Notes of category All
categories", and "Notes of project any".</p>
<p>Another example. If you wish to select all the notes that fall in category
"For church", then tick these conditions: "Notes that have any verse", and
"Notes edited at any time", and "Notes of category For church", and "Notes of
project any".</p>
<h3><a name="notesdisplay"/>Notes display</h3>
<p>"Order center around current reference". When this is ticked, Bibledit
makes an attempt to display notes ordered by how close they are to the
current reference. That is, for example, if the user display Matthew 10:2,
then the notes that are nearest this reference are displayed visibly, and
notes further away are moved away a bit.</p>
<p>"Include in title - project". If this has been ticked, then also the name
of the project the note belongs to will be shown in the blue link, in the
Notes Area.</p>
<p>"Text - summary". Only the first few words of the note are displayed. This
allows many notes to be displayed in a small space. This is supposed to give
a better overview of which notes are available.</p>
<p>"Text - add text of the references". If this is ticked, Bibledit displays
not only the references of the notes, such as Matthew 1:1-2, but it displays
the actual text of those references too. This has been found useful in cases
that worksheets had to be produced for a team discussing some notes.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/view/project-notes.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup/open-network-repository-setup.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Open network repository setup</h1><p>In this tutorial we are going to set up an open repository on the
network.</p>

<p>To create the repository on we need a server. Any of your Linux computers
that is attached to your network will do. In this tutorial we assume that the
computer is accessible from the network through IP address 192.168.0.1. The
user of this computer will be Jim.</p>

<p>To create the repository, login as user jim. Then open a terminal. The
repository is going to be in Jim's home directory. In the terminal type the
following:</p>
<pre>cd</pre>
<pre>mkdir -p git/repository</pre>
<pre>cd git/repository</pre>
<pre>git --bare init --shared</pre>

<p>The repository is now there, but it is not yet accessible from the
network.</p>

<p>To make the repository available to the network, type</p>
<pre>git daemon --export-all --base-path=/home/jim/git --detach --enable=receive-pack</pre>

<p>Each time that the server boots, it is necessary to execute the above
command again. It would be easier to put the command in the boot script. Then
it will automatically be started after boot.</p>

<p>To test access to the new repository from another computer on the network,
type</p>
<pre>git ls-remote git://192.168.0.1/repository</pre>

<p>If everything is fine, no errors will occur.</p>

<p>The next thing is to try whether you can read the repository properly. To
try that, open a terminal and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>git ls-remote ssh://joe@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2</pre>
<p>This command probably will ask for your password, and the first time it

it, then is is necessary to set up secure shell keys. These keys allow easy
access to the secure repository. Please follow the tutorial exactly.</p>
<h3><a name="generatethekeys"/>Generate the keys</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to generate the keys.</p>
<p>On your Linux workstation, open a termial and enter the following:</p>
<pre>cd         <font face="arial, sans-serif">(to make sure you are in your home directory)</font></pre><pre>ls .ssh    <font face="arial, sans-serif">(to check if there is an .ssh directory)</font> </pre>
<pre><font face="arial, sans-serif">If there is no .ssh directory, create one:</font> </pre><pre>mkdir .ssh</pre><pre><font face="arial, sans-serif">then </font></pre><pre>cd .ssh</pre>
<pre>ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -f bibledit-ssh-key</pre>
<p>It will respond as follows:</p>
<pre>Generating public/private dsa key pair.</pre>
<pre>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</pre>
<p>At this stage press Enter. It will continue as follows:</p>
<pre>Enter same passphrase again:</pre>
<p>Press Enter again. It will continue as below:</p>
<pre>Your identification has been saved in bibledit-ssh-key.</pre>
<pre>Your public key has been saved in bibledit-ssh-key.pub.</pre>
<p>It will print some more lines of text. This is not relevant for our
purpose.</p>
<p>This pair of keys is important. The pair is in the ".ssh" directory of your
home directory. There is the private key, in a file called "bibledit-ssh-key",
and the public key, in another file called "bibledit-ssh-key.pub". Store them
safely.</p>
<h3><a name="enterthekeys"/>Enter the keys</h3>
<p>Open a personal account at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">sourceforge.net</a>. Let's choose user name
"repouser". Ask the project administrator whether he can add user "repouser" to
the "repo2" project as a member. Joining this project will
give you the capability to write to the repository.</p>
<p>After logging onto sourceforge.net, click “account” in the upper right, and choose the Services tab, then
choose “Edit SSH Keys for Shell/CVS.” (If the moderator of the project has not yet added you as a member, this page will not have a link to “Edit SSH...”) In the section above, you generated a file
"bibledit-ssh-key.pub". Open it in gedit. Select all the text and copy it to
the clipboard. In the screen titled "SSH Keys", there is a place where it says
"Authorized keys:". Paste the text from gedit into that space on the web page.
After checking that everything looks fine, press button "Update". Synchronizing
the keys into the system has a 10 minute delay.</p>
<p>The next step is to tell the secure shell where to find the private key when
we connect to sourceforge.net, and to set a few other important options. To do
that, open file ~/.ssh/config in gedit. Enter the entry for sourceforge.net,
like so:</p>
<pre>Host *sourceforge.net</pre>
<pre>     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bibledit-ssh-key</pre>
<pre>     BatchMode yes</pre>
<pre>     StrictHostKeyChecking no</pre>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p>The above refers to a file called "bibledit-ssh-key". You have generated
this key before.</p>
<p>If the delay of 10 minutes has expired, we can now try whether the key pair
works well. In the terminal, try to access the repository at sourceforge:</p>
<blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><pre><span style="font-style:normal">git ls-remote ssh://repouser@repo2.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/repo2/repo2</span></pre></blockquote>
<p>If it works then it will give no errors, and list a few commits. If it does
that, then the keys works well. If it asks for a password, or if there are
errors, follow the tutorial again to get everything right.</p><h3><a name="TOC-Reconfiguring-Bibledit-Collaboration-after-Changing-Computers-or-Reinstalling-Ubuntu"/>Reconfiguring Bibledit Collaboration after Changing Computers or Reinstalling Ubuntu</h3><p>After reinstalling Bibledit on your computer and copying your backed-up .bibledit directory, be sure you have copied the back-up of your .ssh directory.</p><p>IMPORTANT: If after reinstalling Bibledit on your computer you have started Bibledit and edited your project since the remote repository was active, make an extra backup of the project now!

<p>In this document we will set up a repository on a USB flash drive, also
called a USB stick.</p>
<h3><a name="formattingthestick"/>Formatting the stick</h3>
<p>Normally a USB stick, as it comes out of the box, has been formatted with a
FAT filesystem. Such a filesystem is not supported for collaboration. The stick
needs to formatted to the ext3 filesystem for collaboration to work. How this
is done will be described here.</p>
<p>Insert the stick into the computer, and wait a little till it gets mounted.
It is supposed to mount automatically. If it does not mount on its own, then
automatic mounting needs to be set up. Setting up automatic mounting goes
beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p>In the terminal, give the command</p>
<pre>df</pre>
<p>The output of this command can be something like:</p>
<pre>Filesystem 1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on<br/>/dev/sda1   93539428  76882380  11905428  87% /<br/>udev           10240       104     10136   2% /dev<br/>tmpfs        1038428         0   1038428   0% /dev/shm<br/>/dev/hda      629742    629742         0 100% /media/cdrom0<br/>/dev/sdb5  306619956 189335920 101708620  66% /media/293gig<br/>/dev/sdc1  240362656  64350876 163801980  29% /media/250gb<br/>/dev/sdd1    1960684    660896   1200188  36% /media/usbdisk</pre>
<p>Looking through the list of mounting points, we assume that the USB stick
that was inserted mounts at /media/usbdisk. From there we can see that the
device is /dev/sdd1. Once we have that information, we are ready for the next
step.</p>
<p>Before the stick can be formatted, it must be unmounted first. Issue the
following command to unmount the stick:</p>
<pre>sudo umount /media/usbdisk</pre>
<p>The "sudo" in the command means that root privileges are needed to execute
the command.</p>
<p>To format the USB stick to the ext3 filesystem, issue the following
command:</p>
<pre>sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdd1</pre>
<p>The formatting process will be visible and at the end some information about
it will be given. At this point it is important to see if no errors
occurred.</p>
<p>The formatting command is very powerful. One could even format the main
drive of the computer, wiping out all information. Extreme care should be used
to ensure that the USB stick is going to be formatted, and nothing else.</p>
<h3><a name="labellingthestick"/>Labelling the stick</h3>
<p>A label needs to be written to the USB stick. The reason of this is so as to
make sure that this stick will always mount at the same mounting point. In this
tutorial we write the label "usbstick" to it.</p>
<p>We take it that the same device is being used as we used for formatting the
stick. That is device /dev/sdd1. To write the label to the stick, issue the
following two commands:</p>
<pre>sudo e2label /dev/sdd1 usbstick</pre>
<pre>sync</pre>
<p>After the label has been written to it, remove the stick from the computer,
and insert it again. It should now mount to the name of the label. In this case
it should mount under /media/usbstick.</p>
<p>This can be verified with command "df":</p>
<pre>df</pre>
<p>The output of this command:</p>
<pre>Filesystem 1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on<br/>/dev/sda1   93539428  76882380  11905428  87% /<br/>udev           10240       104     10136   2% /dev<br/>tmpfs        1038428         0   1038428   0% /dev/shm<br/>/dev/hda      629742    629742         0 100% /media/cdrom0<br/>/dev/sdb5  306619956 189335920 101708620  66% /media/293gig<br/>/dev/sdc1  240362656  64350876 163801980  29% /media/250gb<br/>/dev/sdd1    1960684    660896   1200188  36% /media/usbstick</pre>
<p>This shows that it now mounts under the new name.</p>
<h3><a name="creatingtherepositoryonthestick"/>Creating the repository on the stick</h3>
<p>The USB stick will hold the data repository.</p>
<p>To make this stick fit for collaboration, there are a few steps to be taken.
These steps are:</p>
<p>1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to
make that directory writable. If we assume that the stick mounts at
/media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called "repository"
is:</p>
<pre>sudo mkdir /media/usbstick/repository</pre>
<p>Notice the "sudo" command, which means that this usually needs to be done by
user root. If this is done by an ordinary user, permission would be denied.</p>
<p>Once the directory for the repository is there, this directory needs to be
made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:</p>
<pre>sudo chmod -R 0777 /media/usbstick/repository/</pre>
<p>Note the "sudo" again.</p>
<p>Now it is time to check whether the USB stick is writable. We do this by
trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is
writable. Here's the command:</p>
<pre>touch /media/usbstick/repository/testfile</pre>
<p>This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be
removed again:</p>
<pre>rm /media/usbstick/repository/testfile</pre>
<p>2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory.
Type:</p>
<pre>cd /media/usbstick/repository</pre>
<p>3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick, and to copy the
data to it.</p>
<p>To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:</p>
<pre>git --bare init --shared</pre>
<p>Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been
created.</p>
<p>Before removing the stick, ensure that the data gets written to it, by
issuing the command</p>
<pre>sync</pre>
<p>This finishes setting up the repository on the USB flash drive.</p>
<h3><a name="repositoryurl"/>Repository URL</h3>
<p>The repository that was created in this tutorial has the following URL:</p>
<pre>file:///media/usbstick/repository</pre>
<p>The users that are going to use this repository need this URL.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration/2reposetup/usb-flash-drive-repository-setup.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/export-assistant/sword-module.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/file/export-assistant</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Sword module</h1><h2><a name="TOC-Introduction"/>Introduction<br/></h2><p>Bibledit can create a Sword module out of the USFM code. </p>

<p>This describes the license under which the module is being distributed.</p>
<h3><a name="version"/>Version</h3>
<p>This is the module's revision number of the module. Incrementing it when
changes are made alerts users of the SWORD Installers to the presence of
updated modules. Please start with version 1.0 and increment by 0.1 for minor
updates and by larger values for more major updates such as a new text
source.</p>
<h3><a name="language"/>Language</h3>
<p>This is the primary language code of the module. You can enter a language by
hand, following certain official standards which are recognized in the Sword
system.</p>
<p>In Sword, they prefer to use ISO 639-1. These are two letter language codes.
For example, the code "en" stands for "English". If a language does not exist
in ISO 639-1, the ISO 639-2 standard can be used. If the language is not in
that standard, IANA registered codes can be used, then Ethnologue codes
(encoded as x-SIL-...), then ISO 639-3. The data for the latter is available at
http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/download.asp. All the language codes could have
been included in Bibledit, but to avoid bloat this was not done. The user who
wishes to uses a certain language needs to look its code up on the Internet,
following the standards mentioned above.</p>

<p>Extra keyterms can be imported. This is done through menu File / Keyterms /
Import.</p>

<p>The file that will be imported has to adhere to certain standards. The
various files with keyterms that come with Bibledit show what the format of the
textfiles should be.</p>

<p>There are several different types of textfiles than can be imported.</p>

<p>1. There is the Standard textfile. Samples of this type of file are in the
bibledit distribution or are installed in, normally, /usr/share/bibledit-gtk. These
files start with "keyterms" and have the "txt" extension. Looking for files
like "keyterms*txt" will give them.</p>

<p>2. There is the OTKEY.DB file. A file with that name comes with the bibledit
distribution.</p>

<p>3. There is the KTREF.DB file. A file with that name comes with the bibledit
distribution.</p>

<p>4. There is the data produced by the <a href="http://www.ktbh-team.org/" rel="nofollow">"Key Terms in Biblical Hebrew" project</a>.
This is supported too. It is included with bibledit as KTBH.pbu. If an update
is available, you can import it through the Import function. At KTBH they would
be very grateful if they could get some user feedback on our data. The KTBH
project is still formally under review, and valuable user feedback is
needed.</p>

<p>The keyterms will be imported into a collection. This should be a new
collection, one that does not yet exist.</p>

<p>If you have messed up the keyterms by importing garbage, the collection that
was imported can be <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/menu-keyterms/delete.html">deleted</a> again.</p>

<p>Any keyterms that have been added become available after Bibledit has been
restarted.</p>

<p>Any errors can be sent to the Bibledit bug trackers, apart from errors in
the database provided by Key Terms in Biblical Hebrew project.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/file/import-assistant/keyterms.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/menu-keyterms/delete.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/file/menu-keyterms</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>Delete</h1><h2><a name="TOC-Deleting-keyterms"/>Deleting keyterms</h2>

<h3><a name="whatisaregularexpression"/>What is a Regular Expression?</h3>
<p>A regular expression is a set of characters that specify a pattern. The
term "regular" comes from a term used to describe grammars and formal
languages.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are used when you want to search for specify lines of
text containing a particular pattern. Most of the UNIX utilities operate on
the files a line at a time. Regular expressions search for patterns on a
single line, and not for patterns that start on one line and end on
another.</p>
<p>It is simple to search for a specific word or string of characters. Almost
every editor on every computer system can do this. Regular expressions are
more powerful and flexible. You can search for words of a certain size. You
can search for a word with four or more vowels that end with an "s." Numbers,
punctuation characters, you name it, a regular expression can find it. What
happens once the program you are using find it is another matter. Some just
search for the pattern. Others print out the line containing the pattern.
Editors can replace the string with a new pattern. It all depends on the
utility.</p>
<h3><a name="thestructureofaregularexpression"/>The Structure of a Regular Expression</h3>
<p>There are three important parts to a regular expression. </p>
<p>1. Anchors are used to specify the position of the pattern in relation to
a line of text. </p>
<p>2. Character sets match one or more characters in a single position. </p>
<p>3. Modifiers specify how many times the previous character set is
repeated. </p>
<p>A simple example that demonstrates all three parts is the regular
expression "^#*." The up arrow is an anchor that indicates the beginning of
the line. The character "#" is a simple character set that matches the single
character "#." The asterisk is a modifier. In a regular expression it
specifies that the previous character set can appear any number of times,
including zero. This is a useless regular expression, as you will see
shortly.</p>
<p>There are also two types of regular expressions: the "basic" regular
expression, and the "extended" regular expression. From now on, if I talk
about a "regular expression," it describes a feature in both types.</p>
<h3><a name="theanchorcharactersand"/>The Anchor Characters: ^ and $</h3>
<p>Most UNIX text facilities are line oriented. Searching for patterns that
span several lines is not easy to do. You see, the end of line character is
not included in the block of text wthat is searched. It is a separator.
Regular expressions examine the text between the separators. If you want to
search for a pattern that is at one end or the other, you use anchors. The
character "^" is the starting anchor, and the character "$" is the end
anchor. The regular expression "^A" will match all lines that start with a
capital A. The expression "A$" will match all lines that end with the capital
A. If the anchor characters are not used at the proper end of the pattern,
then they no longer act as anchors. That is, the "^" is only an anchor if it
is the first character in a regular expression. The "$" is only an anchor if
it is the last character. The expression "$1" does not have an anchor.
Neither is "1^." If you need to match a "^" at the beginning of the line, or
a "$" at the end of a line, you must escape the special characters with a
backslash. Here is a summary:</p>
<p>Pattern ^A matches "A" at the beginning of a line.</p>
<p>Pattern A$ matches "A" at the end of a line.</p>
<p>Pattern A^ matches "A^" anywhere on a line.</p>
<p>Pattern $A matches "$A" anywhere on a line.</p>
<p>Pattern ^^ matches "^" at the beginning of a line.</p>
<p>Pattern $$ matches "$" at the end of a line.</p>
<p>The use of "^" and "$" as indicators of the beginning or end of a line is
a convention other utilities use as well. It is one of those choices that
other utilities go along with to maintain consistancy. </p>
<h3><a name="matchingacharacterwithacharacterset"/>Matching a character with a character set</h3>
<p>The simplest character set is a character. The regular expression "the"
contains three character sets: "t," "h" and "e." It will match any line with
the string "the" inside it. This would also match the word "other." To
prevent this, put spaces before and after the pattern: " the ." You can
combine the string with an anchor. The pattern "^From: " will match the lines
of a mail message that identify the sender. Some characters have a special
meaning in regular expressions. If you want to search for such a character,
escape it with a backslash.</p>
<h3><a name="matchanycharacterwith"/>Match any character with .</h3>
<p>The character "." is one of those special meta-characters. By itself it
will match any character, except the end-of-line character. The pattern that
will match a line with a single characters is</p>
<p>^.$</p>
<h3><a name="specifyingarangeofcharacterswith"/>Specifying a Range of Characters with [...]</h3>
<p>If you want to match specific characters, you can use the square brackets
to identify the exact characters you are searching for. The pattern that will
match any line of text that contains exactly one number is</p>
<p>^[0123456789]$</p>
<p>This is verbose. You can use the hyphen between two characters to specify
a range:</p>
<p>^[0-9]$</p>
<p>You can intermix explicit characters with character ranges. This pattern
will match a single character that is a letter, number, or underscore:</p>
<p>[A-Za-z0-9_]</p>
<p>Character sets can be combined by placing them next to each other. If you
wanted to search for a word that</p>
<p>1. Started with a capital letter "T."</p>
<p>2. Was the first word on a line</p>
<p>3. The second letter was a lower case letter</p>
<p>4. Was exactly three letters long, and</p>
<p>5. The third letter was a vowel</p>
<p>the regular expression would be "^T[a-z][aeiou] ."</p>
<h3><a name="exceptionsinacharacterset"/>Exceptions in a character set</h3>
<p>You can easily search for all characters except those in square brackets
by putting a "^" as the first character after the "[." To match all
characters except vowels use "[^aeiou]."</p>
<p>Like the anchors in places that can't be considered an anchor, the
characters "]" and "-" do not have a special meaning if they directly follow
"[." Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Regular expression [] matches the characters "[]".</p>
<p>Regular expression [0] matches the character "0".</p>
<p>Regular expression [0-9] matches any number.</p>
<p>Regular expression [^0-9] matches any character other than a number.</p>
<p>Regular expression [-0-9] matches any number or a "-".</p>
<p>Regular expression [0-9-] matches any number or a "-".</p>
<p>Regular expression [^-0-9] matches any character except a number or a
"-".</p>
<p>Regular expression []0-9] matches any number or a "]".</p>
<p>Regular expression [0-9]] matches any number followed by a "]".</p>
<p>Regular expression [0-9-z] matches any number, or any character between
"9" and "z".</p>
<p>Regular expression [0-9\-a\]] matches any number, or a "-", a "a", or a
"]".</p>
<h3><a name="repeatingcharactersetswith"/>Repeating character sets with *</h3>
<p>The third part of a regular expression is the modifier. It is used to
specify how may times you expect to see the previous character set. The
special character "*" matches zero or more copies. That is, the regular
expression "0*" matches zero or more zeros, while the expression "[0-9]*"
matches zero or more numbers.</p>
<p>This explains why the pattern "^#*" is useless, as it matches any number
of "#'s" at the beginning of the line, including zero. Therefore this will
match every line, because every line starts with zero or more "#'s."</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem that starting the count at zero is stupid.
Not so. Looking for an unknown number of characters is very important.
Suppose you wanted to look for a number at the beginning of a line, and there
may or may not be spaces before the number. Just use "^ *" to match zero or
more spaces at the beginning of the line. If you need to match one or more,
just repeat the character set. That is, "[0-9]*" matches zero or more
numbers, and "[0-9][0-9]*" matches one or more numbers.</p>
<h3><a name="matchingaspecificnumberofsetswithand"/>Matching a specific number of sets with \{ and \}</h3>
<p>You can continue the above technique if you want to specify a minimum
number of character sets. You cannot specify a maximum number of sets with
the "*" modifier. There is a special pattern you can use to specify the
minimum and maximum number of repeats. This is done by putting those two
numbers between "\{" and "\}." The backslashes deserve a special discussion.
Normally a backslash turns off the special meaning for a character. A period
is matched by a "\." and an asterisk is matched by a "\*."</p>
<p>If a backslash is placed before a "&lt;," "&gt;," "{," "}," "(," ")," or
before a digit, the backslash turns on a special meaning. This was done
because these special functions were added later in the life of regular
expressions. Changing the meaning of "{" would have broken old
expressions.</p>
<p>Having convinced you that "\{" isn't a plot to confuse you, an example is
in order. The regular expression to match 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 lower case letters
is</p>
<p>[a-z]\{4,8\}</p>
<p>Any numbers between 0 and 255 can be used. The second number may be
omitted, which removes the upper limit. If the comma and the second number
are omitted, the pattern must be duplicated the exact number of times
specified by the first number.</p>
<p>You must remember that modifiers like "*" and "\{1,5\}" only act as
modifiers if they follow a character set. If they were at the beginning of a
pattern, they would not be a modifier. Here is a list of examples, and the
exceptions:</p>
<p>Regular expression * matches any line with an asterisk.</p>
<p>Regular expression \* matches any line with an asterisk.</p>
<p>Regular expression \\ matches any line with a backslash.</p>
<p>Regular expression ^* matches any line starting with an asterisk.</p>
<p>Regular expression ^A* matches any line.</p>
<p>Regular expression ^A\* matches any line starting with an "A*".</p>
<p>Regular expression ^AA* matches any line if it starts with one "A".</p>
<p>Regular expression ^AA*B matches any line with one or more "A"'s followed
by a "B".</p>
<p>Regular expression ^A\{4,8\}B matches any line starting with 4, 5, 6, 7 or
8 "A"'s followed by a "B".</p>
<p>Regular expression ^A\{4,\}B matches any line starting with 4 or more
"A"'s followed by a "B".</p>
<p>Regular expression ^A\{4\}B matches any line starting with "AAAAB".</p>
<p>Regular expression \{4,8\} matches any line with "{4,8}".</p>
<p>Regular expression A{4,8} matches any line with "A{4,8}".</p>
<h3><a name="matchingwordswithltandgt"/>Matching words with \&lt; and \&gt;</h3>
<p>Searching for a word isn't quite as simple as it at first appears. The
string "the" will match the word "other." You can put spaces before and after
the letters and use this regular expression: " the ." However, this does not
match words at the beginning or end of the line. And it does not match the
case where there is a punctuation mark after the word.</p>
<p>There is an easy solution. The characters "\&lt;" and "\&gt;" are similar
to the "^" and "$" anchors, as they don't occupy a position of a character.
They do "anchor" the expression between to only match if it is on a word
boundary. The pattern to search for the word "the" would be
"\&lt;[tT]he\&gt;." The character before the "t" must be either a new line
character, or anything except a letter, number, or underscore. The character
after the "e" must also be a character other than a number, letter, or
underscore or it could be the end of line character.</p>
<h3><a name="backreferencesrememberingpatternswithand1"/>Backreferences - Remembering patterns with \(, \) and \1</h3>
<p>Another pattern that requires a special mechanism is searching for
repeated words. The expression "[a-z][a-z]" will match any two lower case
letters. If you wanted to search for lines that had two adjoining identical
letters, the above pattern wouldn't help. You need a way of remembering what
you found, and seeing if the same pattern occurred again. You can mark part
of a pattern using "\(" and "\)." You can recall the remembered pattern with
"\" followed by a single digit. Therefore, to search for two identical
letters, use "\([a-z]\)\1." You can have 9 different remembered patterns.
Each occurrence of "\(" starts a new pattern. The regular expression that
would match a 5 letter palindrome, (e.g. "radar"), would be</p>
<p>\([a-z]\)\([a-z]\)[a-z]\2\1</p>
<h3><a name="potentialproblems"/>Potential Problems</h3>
<p>That completes a discussion of the Basic regular expression. Before I
discuss the extensions the extended expressions offer, I wanted to mention
two potential problem areas.</p>
<p>The other potential point of confusion is the extent of the pattern
matches. Regular expressions match the longest possible pattern. That is, the
regular expression</p>
<p>A.*B</p>
<p>matches "AAB" as well as "AAAABBBBABCCCCBBBAAAB." This doesn't cause many
problems using grep, because an oversight in a regular expression will just
match more lines than desired. If you use sed, and your patterns get carried
away, you may end up deleting more than you wanted too.</p>
<h3><a name="extendedregularexpressions"/>Extended Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>With these regular extensions, those special characters preceded by a
backslash no longer have the special meaning: "\{," "\}," "\&lt;," "\&gt;,"
"\(," "\)" as well as the "\digit." There is a very good reason for this,
which I will delay explaining to build up suspense.</p>
<p>The character "?" matches 0 or 1 instances of the character set before,
and the character "+" matches one or more copies of the character set. You
can't use the \{ and \} in the extended regular expressions, but if you
could, you might consider the "?" to be the same as "\{0,1\}" and the "+" to
be the same as "\{1,\}."</p>
<p>By now, you are wondering why the extended regular expressions is even
worth using. Except for two abbreviations, there are no advantages, and a lot
of disadvantages. Therefore, examples would be useful.</p>
<p>The three important characters in the expanded regular expressions are
"(," "|," and ")." Together, they let you match a choice of patterns. </p>
<p>Extended expressions don't have the "\&lt;" and "\&gt;" characters. You
can compensate by using the alternation mechanism. Matching the word "the" in
the beginning, middle, end of a sentence, or end of a line can be done with
the extended regular expression:</p>
<p>(^| )the([^a-z]|$)</p>
<p>There are two choices before the word, a space or the beginining of a
line. After the word, there must be something besides a lower case letter or
else the end of the line. One extra bonus with extended regular expressions
is the ability to use the "*," "+," and "?" modifiers after a "(...)"
grouping. The following will match "a simple problem," "an easy problem," as
well as "a problem."</p>
<p>egrep "a[n]? (simple|easy)? problem" data</p>
<p>I promised to explain why the backslash characters don't work in extended
regular expressions. Well, perhaps the "\{...\}" and "\&lt;...\&gt;" could be
added to the extended expressions. These are the newest addition to the
regular expression family. They could be added, but this might confuse people
if those characters are added and the "\(...\)" are not. And there is no way
to add that functionality to the extended expressions without changing the
current usage. Do you see why? It's quite simple. If "(" has a special
meaning, then "\(" must be the ordinary character. This is the opposite of
the Basic regular expressions, where "(" is ordinary, and "\(" is special.
The usage of the parentheses is incompatable, and any change could break old
programs.</p>
<p>If the extended expression used "( ..|...)" as regular characters, and
"\(...\|...\)" for specifying alternate patterns, then it is possible to have
one set of regular expressions that has full functionality.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/regex.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/sed.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>sed</h1><p>This reference was assembled while closely looking at the information
provided in <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html" rel="nofollow">Sed - An
Introduction and Tutorial</a>. In March 2008, the author, Bruce Barnett, gave
permission to use that information for the reference.</p>
<h3><a name="theessentialcommandsforsubstitution"/>The essential command: s for substitution</h3>
<p>The substitute command is the s. It changes all occurrences of a regular
expression into another value. A simple example changes "day" to "night":</p>
<pre>s/day/night/</pre>
<p>This substitute command consists of four parts.<br/>
</p>
<pre>s         substitute command<br/>/../../   delimiters<br/>day       regular expression pattern string<br/>night     replacement string</pre>
<p>The <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/regex.html">regular expressions</a>
are covered in detail in another reference. </p>
<h3><a name="theslashasadelimiter"/>The slash as a delimiter</h3>
<p>The character after the <i>s</i> is the delimiter. Conventionally it is a
slash, but it can be anything that you want.</p>
<p>For example, it can be an underscore instead of the slash:</p>
<pre>s_day_night_</pre>
<p>Or colons: </p>
<pre>s:day:night:</pre>
<p>Or you can use the "|" character. </p>
<pre>s|day|night|</pre>
<p>Select the one that you want. As long as it is not in the string that you
are looking for, anything works. Also remember that three delimiters are
needed. If you get a "Unterminated 's' command" it is because you are missing
one of them. </p>
<h3><a name="usingampasthematchedstring"/>Using &amp; as the matched string</h3>
<p>At times one may want to search for a pattern and add some characters,
like parenthesis, around or near the pattern that was found. It is easy to do
this if looking for a particular string: </p>
<pre>s/abc/(abc)/</pre>
<p>This won't work if you don't know exactly what you will find. How can you
put the string you found in the replacement string if you don't know what it
is? </p>
<p>The solution requires the special character "&amp;." It corresponds to the
pattern found. </p>
<pre>s/[a-z]*/(&amp;)/</pre>
<p>There can be any number of "&amp;" in the replacement string. You could
also double a pattern, e.g. the first number of a line: </p>
<pre>s/[0-9]*/&amp; &amp;/</pre>
<p>If the input for this rule is "123 abc", then the output will be "123 123
abc".</p>
<p>Let's slightly amend this example. Sed will match the first string, and
make it as greedy as possible. The first match for '[0-9]*' is the first
character on the line, as this matches zero of more numbers. So if the input
was "abc 123" the output would be unchanged, except for a space before the
letters. A better way to duplicate the number is to make sure it matches a
number: </p>
<pre>s/[0-9][0-9]*/&amp; &amp;/</pre>
<p>The input of "123 abc" becomes "123 123 abc".</p>
<h3><a name="using1tokeeppartofthepattern"/>Using \1 to keep part of the pattern</h3>
<p>The use of "(" ")" and "1" has been described in the reference on <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/regex.html">regular expressions.</a> To review,
the escaped parenthesis (that is, parenthesis with backslashes before them)
remember portions of the regular expression. The "\1" is the first remembered
pattern, and the "\2" is the second remembered pattern. If you wanted to keep
the first word of a line, and delete the rest of the line, mark the important
part with the parenthesis: </p>
<pre>s/\([a-z]*\)*/\1/</pre>
<p>If you want to switch two words around, you can remember two patterns and
change the order around: </p>
<pre>s/\([a-z]*\) \([a-z]*\)/\2 \1/<br/></pre>
<p>The "\1" doesn't have to be in the replacement string. It can be in the
pattern you are searching for. If you want to eliminate duplicated words, you
can try: </p>
<pre>s/\([a-z]*\)\1/\1/<br/></pre>
<p>You can have up to nine values: "\1" thru "\9." </p>
<h3><a name="substituteflags"/>Substitute Flags</h3>
<p>You can add additional flags after the last delimiter. These flags can
specify what happens when there is more than one occurrence of a pattern on a
single line, and what to do if a substitution is found.</p>
<h3><a name="gglobalreplacement"/>/g - Global replacement</h3>
<p>Most Unix utilties work on files, reading a line at a time. <i>Sed</i>, by
default, is the same way. If you tell it to change a word, it will only
change the first occurrence of the word on a line. You may want to make the
change on every word on the line instead of the first. For an example, let's
place parentheses around words on a line. Instead of using a pattern like
"[A-Za-z]*" which won't match words like "won't," we will use a pattern, "[^
]*," that matches everything except a space. Well, this will also match
anything because "*" means <b>zero or more</b>. To work around a possible bug
in sed, you must avoid matching the null string when using the "g" flag to
<i>sed</i>. A work-around example is: "[^ ][^ ]*." The following will put
parenthesis around the first word: </p>
<pre>s/[^ ]*/(&amp;)/<br/></pre>
<p>If you want it to make changes for every word, add a "g" after the last
delimiter and use the work-around: </p>
<pre>s/[^ ][^ ]*/(&amp;)/g<br/></pre>
<h3><a name="issedrecursive"/>Is sed recursive?</h3>
<p><i>Sed</i> only operates on patterns found in the incoming data. That is,
the input line is read, and when a pattern is matched, the modified output is
generated, and the <b>rest</b> of the input line is scanned. The "s" command
will not scan the newly created output. That is, you don't have to worry
about expressions like: </p>
<pre>s/loop/loop the loop/g<br/></pre>
<p>This will not cause an infinite loop. If a second "s" command is executed,
it could modify the results of a previous command. I will show you how to
execute multiple commands later. </p>
<h3><a name="12etcspecifyingwhichoccurrence"/>/1, /2, etc. Specifying which occurrence</h3>
<p>With no flags, the first pattern is changed. With the "g" option, all
patterns are changed. If you want to modify a particular pattern that is not
the first one on the line, you could use "\(" and "\)" to mark each pattern,
and use "\1" to put the first pattern back unchanged. This next example keeps
the first word on the line but deletes the second: </p>
<pre>s/\([a-zA-Z]*\) \([a-zA-Z]*\) /\1 /<br/></pre>
<p>This rule is ugly! There is an easier way to do this. You can add a number
after the substitution command to indicate you only want to match that
particular pattern. Example: </p>
<pre>s/[a-zA-Z]* //2<br/></pre>
<p>You can combine a number with the g (global) flag. For instance, if you
want to leave the first world alone alone, but change the second, third, etc.
to DELETED, use /2g: </p>
<pre>s/[a-zA-Z]* /DELETED /2g<br/></pre>
<p>Don't get /2 and \2 confused. The /2 is used at the end. \2 is used in
inside the replacement field. </p>
<p>Note the space after the "*" character. Without the space, <i>sed</i> will
run a long, long time. (Note: this bug is probably fixed by now.) This is
because the number flag and the "g" flag have the same bug. You should also
be able to use the pattern </p>
<pre>s/[^ ]*//2<br/></pre>
<p>but this also eats CPU.<br/>
</p>
<p>The number flag is not restricted to a single digit. It can be any number
from 1 to 512. If you wanted to add a colon after the 80th character in each
line, you could type: </p>
<pre>s/./&amp;:/80<br/></pre>
<h3><a name="combiningsubstitutionflags"/>Combining substitution flags</h3>
<p>You can combine flags when it makes sense. Some things that don't work are
using a number and a "g" flag, because this is inconsistent. </p>
<h3><a name="scripts"/>Scripts</h3>
<p>If you have a large number of <i>sed</i> rules, you can put then into a
script.</p>
<p>A <i>sedscript</i> could look like this: </p>
<pre># sed comment - This script changes lower case vowels to upper case<br/>s/a/A/g<br/>s/e/E/g<br/>s/i/I/g<br/>s/o/O/g<br/>s/u/U/g<br/></pre>
<p>When there are several commands in one file, each command must be on
separate line. </p>
<h3><a name="comments"/>Comments</h3>
<p><i>Sed</i> comments are lines where the first non-white character is a
"#." On many systems, <i>sed</i> can have only one comment, and it must be
the first line of the script. On modern systems, you can have several comment
lines anywhere in the script.</p>
<h3><a name="multiplerulesandorderofexecution"/>Multiple rules and order of execution</h3>
<p>As we explore more of the commands of <i>sed</i>, the commands will become
complex, and the actual sequence can be confusing. It's really quite simple.
Each line is read in. The various commands, in order specified by the user,
has a chance to operate on the input line. After the substitutions are made,
the next command has a chance to operate on the same line, which may have
been modified by earlier commands. If you ever have a question, the best way
to learn what will happen is to just try it out. If a complex command doesn't
work, make it simpler. If you are having problems getting a complex script
working, break it up into two smaller scripts and do them one by one. </p>
<h3><a name="addressesandrangesoftext"/>Addresses and Ranges of Text</h3>
<p>You have only learned one command, and you can see how powerful <i>sed</i>
is. However, all it is doing is a search and substitute. That is, the
substitute command is treating each line by itself, without caring about
nearby lines. What would be useful is the ability to restrict the operation
to certain lines. Some useful restrictions might be: </p>
<p>- Specifying a line by its number.</p>
<p>- Specifying a range of lines by number.</p>
<p>- All lines containing a pattern.</p>
<p>- All lines from the beginning of a file to a regular expression.</p>
<p>- All lines from a regular expression to the end of the file.</p>
<p>- All lines between two regular expressions.<br/>
</p>
<p><i>Sed</i> can do all that and more. Every command in <i>sed</i> can be
assigned an address, range or restriction like the above examples. The
restriction or address immediately precedes the command: </p>
<pre><i>restriction</i> <i>command</i><br/></pre>
<h3><a name="restrictingtoalinenumber"/>Restricting to a line number</h3>
<p>The simplest restriction is a line number. If you wanted to delete the
first number on line 3, just add a "3" before the command: </p>
<pre>3 s/[0-9][0-9]*//<br/></pre>
<h3><a name="patterns"/>Patterns</h3>
<p>Many Unix utilities use a slash to search for a regular expression.
<i>Sed</i> uses the same convention, provided you terminate the expression
with a slash. To delete the first number on all lines that start with a "#,"
use: </p>
<pre>/^#/ s/[0-9][0-9]*//<br/></pre>
<p>I placed a space after the "/<i>expression</i>/" so it is easier to read.
It isn't necessary, but without it the command is harder to fathom.
<i>Sed</i> does provide a few extra options when specifying regular
expressions. But I'll discuss those later. If the expression starts with a
backslash, the next character is the delimiter. To use a comma instead of a
slash, use: </p>
<pre>\,^#, s/[0-9][0-9]*//<br/></pre>
<p>The main advantage of this feature is searching for slashes. Suppose you
wanted to search for the string "/usr/local/bin" and you wanted to change it
for "/common/all/bin." You could use the backslash to escape the slash: </p>
<pre>/\/usr\/local\/bin/ s/\/usr\/local/\/common\/all/<br/></pre>
<p>It would be easier to follow if you used an underline instead of a slash
as a search. This example uses the underline in both the search command and
the substitute command: </p>
<pre>\_/usr/local/bin_ s_/usr/local_/common/all_<br/></pre>
<p>This illustrates why <i>sed</i> scripts get the reputation for obscurity.
I could be perverse and show you the example that will search for all lines
that start with a "g," and change each "g" on that line to an "s:" </p>
<pre>/^g/s/g/s/g<br/></pre>
<p>Adding a space and using an underscore after the substitute command makes
this <b>much</b> easier to read: </p>
<pre>/^g/ s_g_s_g<br/></pre>
<p>Er, I take that back. It's hopeless. There is a lesson here: Use comments
liberally in a <i>sed</i> script. Comments are a Good Thing. You may have
understood the script perfectly when you wrote it. But six months from now it
could look like a confusing thing. </p>
<h3><a name="rangesbylinenumber"/>Ranges by line number</h3>
<p>You can specify a range on line numbers by inserting a comma between the
numbers. To restrict a substitution to the first 100 lines, you can use: </p>
<pre>1,100 s/A/a/<br/></pre>
<p>If you know exactly how many lines are in a file, you can explicitly state
that number to perform the substitution on the rest of the file. In this
case, assume that there are 532 lines in the file: </p>
<pre>101,532 s/A/a/<br/></pre>
<p>An easier way is to use the special character "$," which means the last
line in the file. </p>
<pre>101,$ s/A/a/<br/></pre>
<p>The "$" is one of those conventions that mean "last" in several utilities.
</p>
<h3><a name="rangesbypatterns"/>Ranges by patterns</h3>
<p>You can specify two regular expressions as the range. Assuming a "#"
starts a comment, you can search for a keyword, remove all comments until you
see the second keyword. In this case the two keywords are "start" and "stop:"
</p>
<pre>/start/,/stop/ s/#.*//<br/></pre>
<p>The first pattern turns on a flag that tells <i>sed</i> to perform the
substitute command on every line. The second pattern turns off the flag. If
the "start" and "stop" pattern occurs twice, the substitution is done both
times. If the "stop" pattern is missing, the flag is never turned off, and
the substitution will be performed on every line until the end of the file.
</p>
<p>You should know that if the "start" pattern is found, the substitution
occurs on the same line that contains "start." This turns on a switch, which
is line oriented. That is, the next line is read. If it contains "stop" the
switch is turned off. Otherwise, the substitution command is tried. Switches
are line oriented, and not word oriented. </p>
<p>You can combine line numbers and regular expressions. This example will
remove comments from the beginning of the file until it finds the keyword
"start:" </p>
<pre>1,/start/ s/#.*//<br/></pre>
<p>This example will remove comments everywhere except the lines
<b>between</b> the two keywords: </p>
<pre>1,/start/ s/#.*//' -e '/stop/,$ s/#.*//<br/></pre>
<p>The last example has a range that overlaps the "/start/,/stop/" range, as
both ranges operate on the lines that contain the keywords. I will show you
later how to restrict a command up to, <b>but not including</b> the line
containing the specified pattern. </p>
<p>Before I start discussing the various commands, should show know that some
commands cannot operate on a range of lines. I will let you know when I
mention the commands. I will describe three commands in this secton. One of
the three cannot operate on a range. </p>
<h3><a name="deletewithd"/>Delete with d</h3>
<p>Using ranges can be confusing, so you should expect to do some
experimentation when you are trying out a new script. A useful command
deletes every line that matches the restriction: "d." If you want to look at
the first 10 lines of a file, you can use: </p>
<pre>11,$ d<br/></pre>
<p>which is similar in function to the <i>head</i> command. If you want to
chop off the header of a mail message, which is everything up to the first
blank line, use: </p>
<pre>1,/^$/ d<br/></pre>
<p>The range for deletions can be regular expressions pairs to mark the begin
and end of the operation. Or it can be a single regular expression. Deleting
all lines that start with a "#" is easy: </p>
<pre>/^#/ d<br/></pre>
<p>Removing comments and blank lines takes two commands. The first removes
every character from the "#" to the end of the line, and the second deletes
all blank lines: </p>
<pre>s/#.*//</pre>
<pre>/^$/ d<br/></pre>
<p>A third one should be added to remove all blanks and tabs immediately
before the end of line: </p>
<pre>s/#.*//<br/>s/[ ^I]*$//<br/>/^$/ d<br/></pre>
<p>The character "^I" is a <i>CRTL-I</i> or tab character. You would have to
explicitly type in the tab. Note the order of operations above, which is in
that order for a very good reason. Comments might start in the middle of a
line, with white space characters before them. Therefore comments are first
removed from a line, potentially leaving white space characters that were
before the comment. The second command removes all trailing blanks, so that
lines that are now blank are converted to empty lines. The last command
deletes empty lines. Together, the three commands removes all lines
containing only comments, tabs or spaces. </p>
<p>This demonstrates the pattern space <i>sed</i> uses to operate on a line.
The actual operation <i>sed</i> uses is: </p>
<p>- Copy the input line into the pattern space.</p>
<p>- Apply the first <i>sed</i> command on the pattern space, if the address
restriction is true.</p>
<p>- Repeat with the next sed expression, again operating on the pattern
space.</p>
<p>- When the last operation is performed, write out the pattern space and
read in the next line from the input file.<br/>
</p>
<h3><a name="reversingtherestrictionwith"/>Reversing the restriction with !</h3>
<p>Sometimes you need to perform an action on every line except those that
match a regular expression, or those outside of a range of addresses. The "!"
character, which often means not in Unix utilities, inverts the address
restriction.</p>
<h3><a name="theqorquitcommand"/>The q or quit command</h3>
<p>There is one more simple command that can restrict the changes to a set of
lines. It is the "q" command: quit. the third way to duplicate the head
command is: </p>
<pre>11 q<br/></pre>
<p>which quits when the eleventh line is reached. This command is most useful
when you wish to abort the editing after some condition is reached. </p>
<p>The "q" command is the one command that does not take a range of
addresses. Obviously the command </p>
<pre>1,10 q<br/></pre>
<p>cannot quit 10 times. Instead </p>
<pre>1 q<br/></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre>10 q</pre>
<p>is correct. </p>
<h3><a name="groupingwithand"/>Grouping with { and }</h3>
<p>The curly braces, "{" and "}," are used to group the commands. </p>
<p>Hardly worth the build up. All that prose and the solution is just
matching squigqles. Well, there is one complication. Since each <i>sed</i>
command must start on its own line, the curly braces and the nested
<i>sed</i> commands must be on separate lines. </p>
<p>Previously, I showed you how to remove comments starting with a "#." If
you wanted to restrict the removal to lines between special "begin" and "end"
key words, you could use: <br/>
</p>
<pre>/begin/,/end/ {<br/>s/#.*//<br/>s/[ ^I]*$//<br/>/^$/ d<br/>p<br/>}</pre>
<p>These braces can be nested, which allow you to combine address ranges. You
could perform the same action as before, but limit the change to the first
100 lines: <br/>
</p>
<pre>1,100 {<br/>/begin/,/end/ {<br/>s/#.*//<br/>s/[ ^I]*$//<br/>/^$/ d<br/>p<br/>}<br/>}</pre>
<p>You can place a "!" before a set of curly braces. This inverts the
address, which removes comments from all lines <b>except</b> those between
the two reserved words: <br/>
</p>
<pre>/begin/,/end/ !{<br/>s/#.*//<br/>s/[ ^I]*$//<br/>/^$/ d<br/>p<br/>}</pre>
<h3><a name="thecommentcommand"/>The # Comment Command</h3>
<p>As we dig deeper into <i>sed</i>, comments will make the commands easier
to follow. Older versions of <i>sed</i> only allow one line as a comment, and
it must be the first line. Recent versions allow more than one comment, and
these comments don't have to be first. An example could be: </p>
<h3><a name="addingchanginginsertingnewlines"/>Adding, Changing, Inserting new lines</h3>
<p><i>Sed</i> has three commands used to add new lines to the output stream.
Because an entire line is added, the new line is on a line by itself to
emphasize this. There is no option, an entire line is used, and it must be on
its own line. If you are familiar with many unix utilities, you would expect
<i>sed</i> to use a similar convention: lines are continued by ending the
previous line with a "\". The syntax to these commands are finicky, like the
"r" and "w" commands. </p>
<h4><a name="appendalinewitha"/>Append a line with 'a'</h4>
<p>The "a" command appends a line after the range or pattern. This example
will add a line after every line with "WORD:</p>
<pre>/WORD/ a\</pre>
<pre>Add this line after every line with WORD</pre>
<h4><a name="insertalinewithi"/>Insert a line with 'i'</h4>
<p>You can insert a new line before the pattern with the "i" command: </p>
<pre>/WORD/ i\</pre>
<pre>Add this line before every line with WORD</pre>
<h4><a name="changealinewithc"/>Change a line with 'c'</h4>
<p>You can change the current line with a new line. </p>
<pre>/WORD/ c\</pre>
<pre>Replace the current line with the line</pre>
<p>A "d" command followed by a "a" command won't work, as I discussed
earlier. The "d" command would terminate the current actions. You can combine
all three actions using curly braces: <br/>

<h3><a name="leadingtabsandspacesinasedscript"/>Leading tabs and spaces in a sed script</h3>
<p><i>Sed</i> ignores leading tabs and spaces in all commands. However these
white space characters may or may not be ignored if they start the text
following a "a," "c" or "i" command. If you want to keep leading spaces, and
not care about which version of <i>sed</i> you are using, put a "\" as the
first character of the line: </p>
<pre>a\</pre>
<pre>\        This line starts with a tab</pre>
<h3><a name="addingmorethanoneline"/>Adding more than one line</h3>
<p>All three commands will allow you to add more than one line. Just end each
line with a "\:" </p>
<pre>/WORD/ a\<br/>Add this line\<br/>This line\<br/>And this line</pre>
<h3><a name="addinglinesandthepatternspace"/>Adding lines and the pattern space</h3>
<p>I have mentioned the pattern space before. Most commands operate on the
pattern space, and subsequent commands may act on the results of the last
modification. The three previous commands, like the read file command, add
the new lines to the output stream, bypassing the pattern space.</p>
<h3><a name="addressrangesandtheabovecommands"/>Address ranges and the above commands</h3>
<p>Some commands can take a range of lines, and others cannot. To be precise,
the commands "a," "i," "r," and "q" will not take a range like "1,100" or
"/begin/,/end/." The "c" or change command allows this, and it will let you
change several lines into one: </p>
<pre>/begin/,/end/ c\<br/>***DELETED***<br/></pre>
<p>If you need to do this, you can use the curly braces, as that will let you
perform the operation on every line: </p>
<pre>1,$ {</pre>
<pre>a\</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
<h3><a name="multilinepatterns"/>Multi-Line Patterns</h3>
<p>Most UNIX utilities are line oriented. Regular expressions are line
oriented. Searching for patterns that covers more than one line is not an
easy task. (Hint: It will be very shortly.) </p>
<p><i>Sed</i> reads in a line of text, performs commands which may modify the
line, and outputs modification if desired. The main loop of a <i>sed</i>
script looks like this: </p>
<p>1. The next line is read from the input file and placed in the pattern
space. If the end of file is found, and if there are additional files to
read, the current file is closed, the next file is opened, and the first line
of the new file is placed into the pattern space. </p>
<p>2. The line count is incremented by one.</p>
<p>3. Each <i>sed</i> command is examined. If there is a restriction placed
on the command, and the current line in the pattern space meets that
restriction, the command is executed. Some commands, like "n" or "d" cause
<i>sed</i> to go to the top of the loop. The "q" command causes <i>sed</i> to
stop. Otherwise the next command is examined. </p>
<p>3. After all of the commands are examined, the pattern space is output.
</p>
<p>The restriction before the command determines if the command is executed.
If the restriction is a pattern, and the operation is the delete command,
then the following will delete all lines that have the pattern: </p>
<pre>/PATTERN/ d<br/></pre>
<p>If the restriction is a pair of numbers, then the deletion will happen if
the line number is equal to the first number or greater than the first number
and less than or equal to the last number: </p>
<pre>10,20 d<br/></pre>
<p>If the restriction is a pair of patterns, there is a variable that is kept
for each of these pairs. If the variable is false and the first pattern is
found, the variable is made true. If the variable is true, the command is
executed. If the variable is true, and the last pattern is on the line, after
the command is executed the variable is turned off: </p>
<pre>/begin/,/end/ d<br/></pre>
<p>Whew! That was a mouthful. Hey, I said it was a review. If you have read
the previous lessons, you should have breezed through this. You may want to
refer back to this review, because I covered several subtle points. </p>
<h3><a name="transformwithy"/>Transform with y</h3>
<p>If you wanted to change a word from lower case to upper case, you could
write 26 character substitutions, converting "a" to "A," etc. <i>Sed</i> has
a command that operates like the <i>tr</i> program. It is called the "y"
command. For instance, to change the letters "a" through "f" into their upper
case form, use: </p>
<pre>y/abcdef/ABCDEF/<br/></pre>
<p>I could have used an example that converted all 26 letters into upper
case, and while this column covers a broad range of topics, the "column"
prefers a narrower format. </p>
<p>If you wanted to convert a line that contained a hexadecimal number (e.g.
0x1aff) to upper case (0x1AFF), you could use: </p>
<pre>/0x[0-9a-zA-Z]*/ y/abcdef/ABCDEF<br/></pre>
<p>This works fine if there are only numbers in the file. If you wanted to
change the second word in a line to upper case, you are out of luck - unless
you use multi-line editing.</p>
<h3><a name="displayingcontrolcharacterswithal"/>Displaying control characters with a l</h3>
<p>The "l" command prints the current pattern space. It is therefore useful
in debugging <i>sed</i> scripts. It also converts unprintable characters into
printing characters by outputting the value in octal preceded by a "\"
character.</p>
<h3><a name="theholdbuffer"/>The Hold Buffer</h3>
<p>So far we have talked about three concepts of <i>sed</i>: (1) The input
stream or data before it is modified, (2) the output stream or data after it
has been modified, and (3) the pattern space, or buffer containing characters
that can be modified and send to the output stream. </p>
<p>There is one more "location" to be covered: the <i>hold buffer</i> or
<i>hold space</i>. Think of it as a spare pattern buffer. It can be used to
"copy" or "remember" the data in the pattern space for later. There are five
commands that use the hold buffer. </p>
<h3><a name="exchangewithx"/>Exchange with x</h3>
<p>The "x" command eXchanges the pattern space with the hold buffer. By
itself, the command isn't useful. Executing the <i>sed</i> command</p>
<pre>x<br/></pre>
<p>as a filter adds a blank line in the front, and deletes the last line. It
looks like it didn't change the input stream significantly, but the
<i>sed</i> command is modifying every line. </p>
<p>The hold buffer starts out containing a blank line. When the "x" command
modifies the first line, line 1 is saved in the hold buffer, and the blank
line takes the place of the first line. The second "x" command exchanges the
second line with the hold buffer, which contains the first line. Each
subsequent line is exchanged with the preceding line. The last line is placed
in the hold buffer, and is not exchanged a second time, so it remains in the
hold buffer when the program terminates, and never gets printed. This
illustrates that care must be taken when storing data in the hold buffer,
because it won't be output unless you explicitly request it. </p>
<h3><a name="holdwithhorh"/>Hold with h or H</h3>
<p>The "x" command exchanges the hold buffer and the pattern buffer. Both are
changed. The "h" command copies the pattern buffer into the hold buffer. The
pattern buffer is unchanged.</p>
<h3><a name="flowcontrol"/>Flow Control</h3>
<p>As you learn about <i>sed</i> you realize that it has it's own programming
language. It is true that it's a very specialized and simple language. What
language would be complete without a method of changing the flow control?
There are three commands <i>sed</i> uses for this. You can specify a label
with an text string followed by a colon. The "b" command branches to the
label. The label follows the command. If no label is there, branch to the end
of the script. The "t" command is used to test conditions. </p>
<h3><a name="testingwitht"/>Testing with t</h3>
<p>You can execute a branch if a pattern is found. You may want to execute a
branch only if a substitution is made. The command "t label" will branch to
the label if the last substitute command modified the pattern space. </p>
<p>One use for this is recursive patterns. Suppose you wanted to remove white
space inside parenthesis. These parentheses might be nested. That is, you
would want to delete a string that looked like "( ( ( ())) )." The <i>sed</i>
expressions</p>
<pre>s/([ ^I]*)/g<br/></pre>
<p>would only remove the innermost set. You would have to pipe the data
through the script four times to remove each set or parenthesis. You could
use the regular expression</p>
<pre>s/([ ^I()]*)/g<br/></pre>
<p>but that would delete non-matching sets of parenthesis. The "t" command
would solve this: <br/>
</p>
<pre>:again<br/>s/([ ^I]*)//g<br/>t again</pre>
<h3><a name="passingregularexpressionsasarguments"/>Passing regular expressions as arguments</h3>
<p>In the earlier scripts, I mentioned that you would have problems if you
passed an argument to the script that had a slash in it. In fact, and regular
expression might cause you problems. A script like the following is asking to
be broken some day: </p>
<pre>s/'"$1"'//g</pre>
If the argument contains any of these characters in it you may get a
broken script: "/\.*[]^$." One solution is to have the user put a backslash
before any of these characters when they pass it as an argument. However, the
user has to know which characters are special.</div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/sed.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters/tec.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/menu-preferences/filters</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>TECkit</h1><h2><a name="TOC-TECkit-Language-Reference"/>TECkit Language Reference</h2><br/><p>This reference is not a full reference, but a partial one. It describes
only that part of the TECkit language that is relevant for how Bibledit uses
it. It was assembled while looking at and re-using the information provided
with the TECkit package. This information is used with permission of the
author of TECkit, and of SIL.</p>
<h3><a name="introduction"/>Introduction</h3>
<p>The TECkit language is built around simple mapping rules where a Unicode
character on the left-hand side of the rule is mapped to or from a Unicode
character on the right-hand side. From this basic structure, mapping rules
can be extended by the use of character sequences rather than single
characters on either side; by the addition of contextual constraints
(environments) determining when a rule should apply; and by the use of
character classes, optional and repeatable elements, grouping and alternation
to express more complex patterns to be matched and processed.</p>
<p>The TECkit package, as used in Bibledit, is applied to text processing
operations entirely dealing with Unicode data.</p>
<h3><a name="filestructureandconventions"/>File structure and conventions</h3>
<p>A TECkit description file is strictly line-oriented; every statement is
confined to a single logical line. To allow long rules to be broken across
several lines, for easier editing, TECkit interprets a final backslash (\) as
a “continuation character”; however, only quite complex mappings are
likely to need rules that cannot readily be expressed in a single source
line.</p>
<p>The semicolon (;) introduces a comment that continues to the end of the
(physical) line. TECkit ignores everything following a semicolon, unless it
is in a quoted string.</p>
<p>Built-in keywords in the TECkit mapping language are not case-sensitive;
the compiler will accept any mixture of upper and lower case. This also
applies to Unicode character names. More about this later. However, the names
of character classes defined in the file itself are case-sensitive, and must
be used in a consistent form. More about the character classes later too.</p>
<p>Where “strings” are called for, these may be either single- or
double-quoted. There is no mechanism to “escape” quote marks embedded in
the string; therefore, a single-quoted string can contain double-quote
characters, and vice versa, but it is not possible to include both single and
double quotes in the same quoted string.</p>
<p>Unicode character codes are expressed either numerically or using Unicode
character names, converted into unique “identifiers” by replacing spaces
and hyphens with underscores. TECkit knows a great lot Unicode character
names. The preferred form is to write “U+xxxx”, where xxxx represents
four to six hexadecimal digits. Normal decimal or hex numbers are also
permitted.</p>
<p>Characters may also be expressed as quoted literals. If the mapping source
is Unicode text, then they may be used only for Unicode character values. It
is never legal to use quoted literals on both sides of the mapping.</p>
<p>A complete TECkit mapping description consists of a header section
followed by one or more mapping passes. The simplest Unicode mapping
descriptions will contain just one Unicode pass, but for some complex
mappings it may be necessary to perform pre- and/or post-processing such as
character reordering in other passes. The LHS code space of each pass must
correspond to the RHS code space of the pass before it.</p>
<h3><a name="headerinformation"/>Header information</h3>
<p>The mapping file begins with header information, which consists of a
number of pieces of information about the encoding and mapping, each
specified by a keyword followed by a quoted string:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">EncodingName</span></p>
<p>A name that uniquely identifies this mapping table.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">DescriptiveName</span></p>
<p>A string that describes the mapping.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Version</span></p>
<p>The version of the mapping description.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Contact</span></p>
<p>Contact information.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">RegistrationAuthority</span></p>
<p>The organization responsible for the encoding.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">RegistrationName</span></p>
<p>The name and version of the mapping.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Copyright</span></p>
<p>Copyright information.</p>
<p>Only the encoding name is required.</p>
<p>An alternative form of header should be used for mapping descriptions that
do transliterations entirely within Unicode. Instead of EncodingName and
DescriptiveName, the following four fields are used:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">LHSName</span></p>
<p>Canonical name of the “source” encoding or left-hand side of the
description.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">RHSName</span></p>
<p>Canonical name of the “target” encoding or right-hand side of the
description.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">LHSDescription</span></p>
<p>Description for the left-hand side of the mapping.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">RHSDescription</span></p>
<p>Description for the right-hand side of the mapping.</p>
<p>Note that while we sometimes think of the left-hand side of the
description as “source” and the right-hand side as “target”, TECkit
descriptions and mapping tables are bi-directional, and thus these roles can
equally well be exchanged.</p>
<p>Finally, the file header can include “flags” that specify certain
features of the encoding for both the left- and right-hand sides of the
mapping.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">LHSFlags ( list-of-flags )</span></p>
<p>Features of the LHS encoding.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">RHSFlags ( list-of-flags )</span></p>
<p>Features of the RHS encoding.</p>
<p>For each side of the mapping, zero or more of the following flags can be
specified:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">ExpectsNFC</span></p>
<p>Input on this side of the mapping should be in fully-composed form.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">ExpectsNFD</span></p>
<p>Input on this side of the mapping should be in fully-decomposed form.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">GeneratesNFC</span></p>
<p>Output on this side of the mapping is fully-composed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">GeneratesNFD</span></p>
<p>Output on this side of the mapping is fully-decomposed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">VisualOrder</span></p>
<p>This side of the mapping deals with visual (rather than logical) text
order.</p>
<p>The “<span style="font-weight:bold">expects</span>” flags can be used
to specify that Unicode input to this side of the mapping should be
normalized before it is presented to the actual mapping rules. By specifying
a normalization form for the Unicode side of a mapping description, the
author can write mapping rules assuming a particular canonical
representation. The TECkit engine will take care of normalizing the input
text so that it matches the expectation of the rules.</p>
<p>The “<span style="font-weight:bold">generates</span>” flags allow the
mapping author to declare which normalization form will be produced by the
mapping rules. However, as it can be difficult to ensure the accuracy of
this, TECkit does not “trust” this flag, but always explicitly normalizes
the output if requested by the application using the mapping.</p>
<p>A typical example of the header information might be:</p>
<pre>  EncodingName          "Bibledit-NdebeleDiglot-2008"</pre>
<pre>  DescriptiveName       "Simple rules for transliteration"</pre>
<pre>  Version               "1"</pre>
<pre>  Contact               "mailto:author@domain.org"</pre>
<pre>  RegistrationAuthority "Bibledit International Ltd."</pre>
<pre>  RegistrationName      "Bibledit Ndebele Diglot"</pre>
<pre>  Copyright             "(c)2008 The Author (released under GPL3"</pre>

<pre>  LHSFlags              ()</pre>
<pre>  RHSFlags              (ExpectsNFD GeneratesNFD)</pre>
<h3><a name="mappingpasses"/>Mapping passes</h3>
<p>The heart of a mapping description is the series of mapping passes that
relate characters or sequences on the LHS to those on the RHS. In simple
cases there is just one pass.</p>
<p>Each pass begins with a header line that declares the encoding space in
which it operates:</p>
<pre>  pass( pass-type )</pre>
<p>where pass-type is one of:</p>
<pre>  Byte</pre>
<pre>  Unicode</pre>
<pre>  Byte_Unicode</pre>
<pre>  Unicode_Byte</pre>
<p>As Bibledit only works with UTF-8 encoded data, the pass-type should
always be Unicode.</p>
<p>There are also special “normalization pass” types that can be used in
special cases. To create a normalization pass, specify pass-type as one
of:</p>
<pre>  NFC_fwd</pre>
<pre>  NFD_fwd</pre>
<pre>  NFC_rev</pre>
<pre>  NFD_rev</pre>
<pre>  NFC</pre>
<pre>  NFD</pre>
<p>As the names suggest, these apply the NFC or NFD Unicode normalization
forms as part of the forward, reverse, or both processing “pipelines”.
Most mappings will not need to include explicit normalization passes, as the
ExpectsNFC or ExpectsNFD flag can be used to request pre-normalization of
Unicode data before any mapping rules are applied, and applications using
TECkit can explicitly request either NFC or NFD data when mapping to Unicode.
The only reason to use a normalization pass in a mapping description would be
to ensure that data is in a particular normalization form somewhere in the
middle of a multi-pass Unicode transduction.</p>
<h3><a name="classdefinitions"/>Class definitions</h3>
<p>Character classes may be used to make the mapping description more
readable and concise; suitable class definitions allow a single rule to
express a whole set of related mappings. They are typically used in
contextual constraints or as elements of rules that reorder character
sequences.</p>
<p>Classes are defined with the UniClass statement:</p>
<pre>  UniClass [ name ] = ( unicodeSequence )</pre>
<p>Class names, always enclosed in square brackets, are “identifiers”
that may contain letters, digits, and the underscore character; they may not
begin with a digit. Unlike the keywords of the TECkit language, they are
case-sensitive. The Unicode sequence is a space-separated list of character
codes, similar to those used in mapping rules (see below), with the addition
of a “range” notation: two character codes separated by .. represent the
complete set of characters from the first to the second (inclusive).</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre>  UniClass [control] = ( U+0000..U+001f U+007f )</pre>
<pre>  UniClass [letter] = ( U+0041..U+005a U+0061..U+007a )</pre>
<h3><a name="defaultsforunmappedcharacters"/>Defaults for unmapped characters</h3>
<p>In Unicode passes, any characters not explicitly matched by mapping rules
will be output unchanged. </p>
<h3><a name="mappingrules"/>Mapping rules</h3>
<p>The actual mapping from Unicode to Unicode is expressed as a list of
mapping rules. A mapping description actually contains two complete sets of
mapping rules, one set that matches characters in the first Unicode text and
generates Unicode, and the other set that match Unicode characters in the
second text and generate Unicode for the first text. However, in most cases
it is simplest to express both mappings at once, using bi-directional rules
where either side of the rule can act as “match” with the other being
“replacement”.</p>
<p>The general form of a mapping rule is:</p>
<pre>  lhsSeq [ / lhsContext ] operator rhsSeq [ / rhsContext ]</pre>
<p>Here, <span style="font-style:italic">operator</span> indicates whether
this rule is to be used only when mapping from the left-hand side to the
right, from the right-hand side to the left, or (the most common case) in
both directions:</p>
<pre>  &lt;&gt;   bidirectional mapping rule</pre>
<pre>  &gt;    unidirectional LHS-to-RHS rule</pre>
<pre>  &lt;    unidirectional RHS-to-LHS rule</pre>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">lhsSeq</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">rhsSeq</span> parts of the rule are simple lists
of character codes. These may be expressed as decimal numbers or as
hexadecimal (prefixed with 0x). In Unicode sequences, characters may also be
listed by their Unicode character names as found in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt</a>,
with all non-alphanumeric characters in the names converted to underscores;
thus, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">thai_character_ko_kai</span> may be used instead
of 0x0E01 to make the mapping description file more self-documenting. The
Unicode character names are not case-sensitive.</p>
<p>During the mapping operation, whichever of <span style="font-style:italic">lhsSeq</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">rhsSeq</span> corresponds to the input side of
the rule can be considered a “match string”, with the other being its
“replacement”. The context associated with the match string, if any, acts
as a constraint on the application of the rule. Any context associated with
the replacement is irrelevant; it would be used when mapping in the other
direction.</p>
<p>Character class references may be used in the match and replacement
sequences, although for clarity it may be better to list each individual
character mapping. If a class is used on the replacement side of a rule, it
must correspond to a class on the match side, and the resulting rules will
map each character in the match class to the equivalent character in the
replacement class. The classes must contain the same number of characters.
Item tags, see below, may be used to associate the replacement class item
with its corresponding match item; in the absence of such tags, items are
matched by position within the match and replacement strings.</p>
<p>For contextually constrained mappings, the <span style="font-style:italic">lhsContext</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">rhsContext</span> parts of the mapping rule are
used. These use a “slash … underscore” notation:</p>
<pre>  / preContextSeq _ postContextSeq</pre>
<p>The match and replace strings and the pre- and post-contexts may be simple
sequences of character codes, or may be more complex expressions using the
following “regular expression” elements:</p>
<pre>  [cls]    match any character from the class cls</pre>
<pre>  .        match any single character</pre>
<pre>  #        match beginning or end of input text</pre>
<pre>  ^item    ‘not item’: match anything except the given item</pre>
<p>The 'not item' applies to single items only; negated groups are not
supported.</p>
<pre>  (...)    grouping (for optionality or repeat counts)</pre>
<pre>  |        alternation (within group): match either preceding or following sequence</pre>
<pre>  {a,b}    match preceding item minimum a times, maximum b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 15)</pre>
<pre>  ?        match preceding item 0 or 1 times</pre>
<pre>  *        match preceding item 0 to 15 times</pre>
<pre>  +        match preceding item 1 to 15 times</pre>
<pre>  =tag     tag preceding item for match/replacement association</pre>
<pre>  @tag     duplicate the tagged item (including groups) from LHS</pre>
<p>The @tag can only occur on RHS. It is typically used to implement
reordering.</p>
<p>A couple of notes on the use of regular expressions and context
constraints:</p>
<ul><li>Repeat counts or optionality may be applied to parenthesized groups as
well as to individual items.</li><li>It is meaningless to specify context on the replacement side of a
unidirectional rule; contextual constraints apply to the matching process
on the input side of the conversion.</li><li>The special ‘#’ code is only meaningful as the first item in the
pre-context or the last item in the post-context; in effect, there is an
“end of text” pseudo-character before the first real character of
input, and one after the last, which can only match this code.</li><li>A negated item is still a “concrete” item that matches a real
character in the input or the “end of text” pseudo-character.</li><li>No repeatable item can ever match more than 15 times; unlike standard
regular expressions, the <span style="font-style:italic">star</span>
and <span style="font-style:italic">plus</span> operators have a fixed
upper bound. In principle, a repeatable element within a repeatable group
will permit a higher total number of repetitions.</li></ul>
<p>Rules are tested from the most to the least specific, where a longer rule
(counting the length of context as well as the actual match string) is
considered more specific than a shorter one. If there are two equally long
rules that could match at a particular place in the input, the first one
listed in the mapping description file will be used.</p>
<p>The maximum potential length of any pre-context (considering all repeat
counts) in a pass, plus the maximum potential match string, plus the maximum
potential post-context, must not exceed 255 characters. Similarly, the
maximum output that can be generated from any rule is limited to 255
characters. </p>
<h3><a name="macros"/>Macros</h3>
<p>TECkit supports a simple macro facility; this may be used to define
symbols that act as “shorthand” for frequently-used fragments of a
mapping description, such as character classes that are needed in multiple
passes, or sequences used in the context of multiple rules.</p>
<p>A macro is defined with a line of the form:</p>
<pre>  Define name &lt;arbitrary TECkit source&gt;</pre>
<p>Following such a line, wherever such names are found in the description,
these are treated as representing the specified source texts. </p>
<p>This is particularly useful when the context is complex, perhaps involving
several alternatives or multiple repeatable items; suitably descriptive macro
names may also serve to make the mapping description more
self-documenting.</p>
<p>Another use for macros is to provide more convenient names for Unicode
characters. This can help make mapping descriptions more readable.</p>
<p>Note that macros must be defined before they are used, including any use
in the definition of other macros; thus, it is legitimate to say:</p>
<pre>Define NUL   0x00</pre>
<pre>Define DEL   0x7F</pre>
<pre>Define ASCII NUL..DEL</pre>
<p>But with the definitions rearranged so that NUL and DEL are not defined
when they are used in the definition of ASCII, even if they are defined
subsequently, the result will be a compile-time error:</p>
<pre>Define ASCII NUL..DEL</pre>
<pre>Define NUL   0x00</pre>
<pre>Define DEL   0x7F</pre>
<pre>ByteClass[asc] = (ASCII)</pre>
<p>This will generate an error on the ByteClass line, because the identifiers
NUL and DEL found in the expansion of ASCII will be considered undefined.</p>
<h3><a name="unicodeonlymappings"/>Unicode-only mappings</h3>
<p>The TECkit system, while targeted primarily at byte/Unicode conversion, is
used by Bibledit for Unicode mapping operations. A mapping description need

both input and output are Unicode data.</p>

button Dictionaries.</p>
<p>The dialog lists the dictionaries that are used for checking the spelling of
the text of the project.</p>
<h3><a name="connecting"/>Connecting</h3>
<p>Press button "Connect" to connect to a dictionary and add it to the list.</p>
<p>There are various types of dictionaries that can be added.</p>
<p>- "Project &lt;project name&gt; Shared Dictionary. This dictionary belongs
to a project. It is called "shared", because if <a href="./site/gtk/tutorials/collaboration.html">collaboration</a> is used, the dictionary is shared
with other workstations.</p>
<p>- Dictionaries that have two-letter names, such as "en", "he", "en_ZW", and
so forth. These are dictionaries that are installed on your system. Bibledit
does not know what these abbreviations mean. Some of them can be guessed. It
depends entirely on which dictionaries you have installed on your system.</p>
<p>- "Global Dictionary". This is one global dictionary provided by
Bibledit.</p>
<h3><a name="disconnecting"/>Disconnecting</h3>
<p>To disconnect a dictionary, select it, and press the Disconnect button.</p>
<p>If a dictionary is "disconnected", it remains on disk. This dictionary is no
longer used to check the text of the project.</p>
<h3><a name="editing"/>Editing</h3>
<p>Some <a href="./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/project/project-properties/dictionaries/edit.html">dictionaries can be edited</a>, and
others cannot. If a dictionary can be edited, then the "Edit" button is
sensitive. If this button is clicked, all the words in the dictionary become
visible. These can be edited, and if Ok is pressed, these are saved to disk.</p>
<h3><a name="order"/>Order</h3>
<p>If spelling of text is to be checked, Bibledit consults all the dictionaries
that are in the list. It starts from the top one, and works to the bottom, in
order to find the word. If you wish to use another order, you can drag a
dictionary to another position.</p>
<h3><a name="systemdictionaries"/>System dictionaries</h3>
<p>Bibledit accesses the dictionaries through Enchant. Enchant supports a
variety of spelling check programs. It supports Aspell, Hspell, Ispell,
MySpell, and so forth. Any dictionaries installed on your system for these
spelling checkers will become available to Bibledit through Enchant. For
example, if Dutch spelling checking is desired using Aspell, then a package
like with a name like "aspell-nl" should be installed. Once done, this language
is available.</p></div></body></html><name>site/gtk/reference/menu/file/project/project-properties/dictionaries.html</name></url><url><loc>./site/gtk/reference/menu/file/styles/stylesheet/new.html</loc><priority>0.5</priority><dir>site/gtk/reference/menu/file/styles/stylesheet</dir><html><head/><body><div id="menu"/><div id="content"><h1>New</h1><h2><a name="TOC-New-stylesheet"/>New stylesheet</h2>

<p>In this dialog the user can edit the contents of an editable

<p>Text can be added to this dialog, or removed.</p>

<p>Button "Sort, remove duplicates" does what it says, it sorts all the words

<p>The user can import words from another dictionary, or export them to
another dictionary.</p>

<p>The user also can import from a file, or export to a file.</p>
