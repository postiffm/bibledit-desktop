The help that comes with Bibledit-Desktop is a copy of the content of the
wiki at http://sites.google.com/site/bibledit.

Before releasing a new version of Bibledit-Desktop, it is important
that this help content is updated since the wiki may have been changed.

To update the online help, do the following:

In a terminal, change to the current directory. 
This is the directory where this README file is located.
Then run the retrieval file, like so: perl retrieve.pl
This retrieves all content from the wiki.
Then create the menus: perl menus.pl
